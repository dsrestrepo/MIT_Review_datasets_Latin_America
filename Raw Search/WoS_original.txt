J	Tucker, KL; Bianchi, LA; Maras, J; Bermudez, OI				Tucker, KL; Bianchi, LA; Maras, J; Bermudez, OI			Adaptation of a food frequency questionnaire to assess diets of Puerto Rican and non-Hispanic adults	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						diet; epidemiologic methods; ethnic groups; questionnaires	VALIDITY; REPRODUCIBILITY; LIMITATIONS	To study issues of diet and health among Hispanic adults living in the northeastern United States, the authors adapted a version of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)/Block food frequency questionnaire. Foods that contributed to nutrient intake of Puerto Rican adults in the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) were ranked to identify items to be added to the food list, Portion sizes were compared across HHANES and the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) to assess the adequacy of the assumed values. Within line items, frequencies of consumption of individual foods were ranked and these data were used to adjust the weighting factors within the database. To test the revised form, 24-hour recalls were collected from 90 elderly Hispanics and 35 elderly non-Hispanic whites, These data were coded into the original and revised food frequency forms and nutrient intake results were compared with recall results by paired t-test, and by Pearson and intraclass correlations, Added foods include plantains, avocado, mango, cassava, empanadas, and custard, Portion sizes differed significantly between HHANES and NHANES II, and were left open-ended. Estimated mean nutrient intakes and correlations with recall data were lower with the original versus the revised form, The authors conclude that the use in minority populations of food frequency questionnaires developed for the general population is likely to result in biased estimates of intake unless modifications are made in the questionnaires.

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 116 surveys were sent to major teaching institutions in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Crete, and South Korea after a national conference held at the National Institutes of Health regarding peripartum cardiomyopathy. This was an open-ended survey containing 17 specific questions regarding this disorder and its management. RESULTS: A total of 78 (67%) maternal-fetal specialists responded to the survey. Diuretics and digoxin were used as first-line treatment for this disorder. Only 6% used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during pregnancy. Fifty-eight percent of the perinatologists (58%) recommended either intrauterine contraceptive devices or foam and condoms, whereas oral contraceptives (progesterone-only pill or estrogen-progesterone mix) were recommended in 23% and 41%, respectively. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the respondents would recommend future pregnancy if ventricular function returned to normal. CONCLUSIONS: Fundamental clinical and basic research is lacking regarding this rare but potentially devastating disorder. Major teaching institutions do not have significant numbers of patients with this disorder to provide concrete recommendations, and starting a database will be useful in the gathering of important epidemiologic information. A secondary aim of such a registry would be to establish a repository for tissue and blood samples to answer basic mechanistic questions about this disorder.

Body mass index and mortality rate among Hispanic adults: a pooled analysis of multiple epidemiologic data sets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article						body mass index; hispanic adults; mortality rate	UNITED-STATES; METABOLIC SYNDROME; MEXICAN-AMERICANS; WEIGHT-LOSS; TIME-SCALE; US ADULTS; FOLLOW-UP; OBESITY; PREVALENCE; OVERWEIGHT	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between body mass index (BMI, kg m(-2)) and mortality rate among Hispanic adults. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Analysis of five data sets (total N = 16 798) identified after searching for publicly available, prospective cohort data sets containing relevant information for at least 500 Hispanic respondents (>= 18 years at baseline), at least 5 years of mortality follow-up, and measured height and weight. Data sets included the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the Puerto Rico Heart Health Program (PRHHP), the Hispanic Established Population for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (HEPESE), the San Antonio Heart Study (SAHS) and the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging. RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusting for sex and smoking, were fit within three attained-age strata (18 to younger than 60 years, 60 to younger than 70 years, and 70 years and older). We found that underweight was associated with elevated mortality rate for all age groups in the PRHHP (hazard ratios [HRs] = 1.38-1.60) and the SAHS (HRs = 1.88-2.51). Overweight (HRs = 0.38 and 0.84) and obesity grade 2-3 (HRs = 0.75 and 0.60) associated with reduced mortality rate in the HEPESE dataset for those in the 60 to younger than 70 years, and 70 years and older attained-age strata. Weighted estimates combining the HRs across the data sets revealed a similar pattern. CONCLUSION: Among Hispanic adults, there was no clear evidence that overweight and obesity associate with elevated mortality rate.	[Fontaine, K.

J	Gould, CC				Gould, Carol C.			Solidarity and the problem of structural injustice in healthcare	BIOETHICS			English	Article						healthcare; justice; solidarity	JUSTICE	The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature. When understood descriptively, it usefully supplements other conceptions like reciprocity (e.g., between healthcare providers and their patients), patient-centered medicine, or care ethics. In the context of health insurance (especially in Europe), an appeal to solidarity effectively addresses the problem of the motivation for taking seriously the medical needs of compatriots by emphasizing shared vulnerabilities and needs. If understood more broadly as human solidarity, the notion proposes attention to the health of distant others, as a condition of their dignity. And taken normatively, it fills in some of the requirements of the abstract norms of justice and equality by advocating 'standing with' or aiding fellow community members or possibly also distant others in regard to their medical needs. Solidarity may be understood be required either for its own sake, when taken as a separate norm, or as a way to realize the demands of justice and equal treatment in matters of health. The current focus on solidarity in the healthcare literature is useful and important, in my view. Yet, to my mind, the understanding of it tends to be unduly restricted. For one thing, the literature has most often focused on solidarity within nation-states, as a relation among compatriots that supports universal healthcare. The notion is also seen as having import for contemporary developments like large health databases, biobanks, personalized medicine, and organ donation. A few authors extend solidarity more widely, particularly in interpreting the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, with its reference to solidarity in Article 13 and its implication in some other articles. Yet, these various uses of the conception of solidarity in healthcare have thus far tended to either disregard or even to actively eschew its traditional meanings of labor solidarity or social movement solidarity, or indeed, any use of the term that posits an 'other' against which solidarity might be practiced (although it is generally recognized that the concept is bounded and particular). I suggest that the neglect of some important historical (and contemporary) senses of solidarity-and especially social movement solidarity-leads to a blind spot in the current bioethical theories. An alternative reading of solidarity in healthcare drawing on social movement and labor contexts would highlight a crucial dimension of contemporary healthcare provision, namely, structural injustice. Systemic forms of injustice militate against adequate healthcare for all, and suggest the need for solidaristic action to struggle against and to remedy existing entrenched inequalities. Omitting an account of structural injustice and even of justice itself from the core meaning of solidarity leads, I argue, to a rather weak and too easy sense of what solidarity requires, and is ill suited to serve as an adequate normative guide for improving healthcare in the present. This is the case most obviously in regard to healthcare in the United States with its unequal health system, but I suggest it applies more generally and even in Europe, and certainly if we take the obligations of solidarity to extend transnationally. While traditional notions of solidarity within existing communities and nation-states remain significant, I believe that an adequate conception of solidarity needs to show how it is connected to justice. It also needs to extend transnationally, given our increasingly interconnected world, which raises difficult questions of the relation between national and transnational solidarities, and the justifications we can give for prioritizing the health and healthcare of those closer to us. In this essay, I will begin by briefly indicating how the existing approaches to solidarity in healthcare, despite their trenchant analyses of many of its features and applications, remain abstract and without sufficient critical import by not directly considering the impact of structural injustices. I will then attempt to sketch how an understanding of institutional barriers to equal treatment, along with the commitment to achieving justice concretely, need to inform not only our application of solidarity in practice but also our understanding of the core meaning of solidarity itself. I will not be able to address here the complex question of the priority that is often given to the needs of those close to us and the related question of negotiating our obligations to engage in national vs. transnational solidarity efforts, but I have taken this up in other work. In a series of books and articles, Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx have taken the lead in calling attention to the relevance of the concept of solidarity for bioethics. They have articulated a general conception and sketched several potential implications for healthcare and bioethics more widely. They advance the following definition: 'Solidarity is an enacted commitment to carry "costs" (financial, social, emotional, or otherwise) to assist others with whom a person or persons recognize similarity in a relevant respect.' Prainsack and Buyx usefully develop the notion of solidarity as a practice and see it as operating within three domains: the interpersonal, the group, and the administrative/legal. Their conception is largely descriptive, although it has some normative preconditions, and involves what they call axiological/axiomatic normativity of some sort. The difficulty of this latter phrase aside, Prainsack and Buyx seem willing to countenance morally negative expressions of solidarity (e.g., among members of a gang or even a terror group) in the interest of preserving the analytic utility of the concept. Moreover, they sharply distinguish solidarity from justice, regarding the latter as deontic and thus as not part of the concept of solidarity itself. But given their attention to the context of the practice of solidarity, they expect that norms like justice would be brought to bear, presumably to qualify the practice of solidarity. Since Prainsack and Buyx's approach is perhaps the most highly developed conception of solidarity in the bioethics literature, it can serve as a useful foil for elaborating my own account, drawing on and extending my previous work on this theme. The main strength of their approach, it seems to me, lies in its aptness for understanding solidarity as a group practice, and especially within nation-states. Indeed, their view, with its emphasis on bearing costs to assist others within a group, seems to line up primarily with what has been called a 'civic solidarity' conception, one that has been prominent in connection with European welfare states. The idea that solidarity can come to be entrenched administratively and legally also points to the dominance of that European model in their understanding (though their conception is supplemented with what they call interpersonal solidarity). Importantly, these authors' emphasis on solidarity as a practice helpfully ties solidarity to action. They suggest that this action orientation serves to distinguish solidarity from empathy or other sentiments. However, the centrality in their account of bearing 'costs' with the aim of assisting others brings the model close to the Christian tradition of solidarity with its emphasis on relieving suffering and aiding the poor. Their perspective likewise focuses on individual activity in aiding others, rather than on collective action. (The term 'costs', however, has financial connotations that do not sit altogether easily with this religious perspective.) The Christian tradition of solidarity can be distinguished (at least in its older forms) from the alternative socialist tradition of labor union solidarity, where solidarity is aimed at promoting shared interests and overcoming domination and exploitation with the aim of achieving justice. In this article, I will suggest that this latter understanding of solidarity introduces an important normative aspect of the concept of solidarity, one that is largely lacking in Prainsack and Buyx's account. Although Prainsack and Buyx are at pains to differentiate between solidarity and charity (which is indeed an important distinction), I find their argument on this point unconvincing. They claim that charity is marked by assistance for others who are perceived as 'different' from oneself, rather than as being 'similar in a relevant respect.' The problem is that this distinction could be seen as having a question-begging aspect, inasmuch as the authors seem to posit by definition that in cases where people choose to donate to charities for people with a similar condition to their own (e.g., a particular illness), they are in fact acting in solidarity rather than charity. At the very least, more argument would be needed to establish the difference in question. Indeed, the issue of what is perceived as 'similar' and what counts as 'a relevant respect,' remains rather vague in their account. Clearly, perceptions of similarity and difference are notably various and variable. Can the perception of similarity with another in a relevant respect always be explained in a way that itself makes no reference to the solidarity that is supposed to follow from it, as it would have to be to avoid circularity? Is it, for example, the abstract status of being a fellow citizen that generates solidarity or does our tie to these others already presuppose pre-existing solidarities, e.g., as being members of our nation? The account would need to explicitly address questions such as these and also explicate what counts as 'similar in a relevant respect' to concretize this notion and give it real utility. In my own view, as developed elsewhere and as will become clear below, the distinction of solidarity from charity turns rather on the connection that solidarity bears to justice, and to the overcoming of domination and exploitation. It can also be seen to involve reciprocity in a sense to be indicated, which charity does not. Indeed, Prainsack and Buyx sharply distinguish between solidarity and reciprocity, taking the latter in the narrow sense of what I have elsewhere called instrumental reciprocity or 'tit for tat' reciprocity. In my view, reciprocity is a fundamental social relation that in fact takes several forms besides such instrumental ones, and I believe that reciprocity remains important for properly understanding solidarity. This potential for reciprocity helps to distinguish solidarity from charity, since charity evidently does not presuppose reciprocation from the needy or those aided. The reciprocity that applies to solidarity actions can be seen in the notion of mutual aid, which has been part of traditional understandings of labor and social movement solidarity. The mutuality involved here is itself a developed form of reciprocity, but one characterized not instrumentally in the manner of Prainsack and Buyx. Rather, reciprocity and the solidarity that incorporates it are here seen as aiming at improving the situation of the other, at least partly for its own sake, and not only for the subsequent return of benefit that could be expected from doing so. Although they do not explicitly tie solidarity to the overcoming of domination and exploitation, Prainsack and Buyx do helpfully take note of the dangers for healthcare posed by commercial interests, as well as entrenched inequalities. This is evident, for example, in their account of the problems that afflict the use of large databases and biobanks, as well as the perils that attend some proposed uses of personalized medicine. But these problematic dimensions of contemporary life are treated more as background conditions rather than as structural and institutional features against which solidarity actions with others need to struggle. Moreover, we can observe that the prevalence of commercial interests in regard to health databases can undercut the very possibilities for solidarity that these authors seek, by deterring people from contributing their information to them from fear of such commercial use. This lends an additional practical motivation to taking these structural background conditions seriously, if solidarity is to be encouraged. Certainly, these authors are right to highlight forms of solidarity that may arise in pursuit of common aims or shared goals, as within a political community (often taken as national). But I would suggest that solidarity is also centrally a process aimed at overcoming forms of domination and structural injustice, where people share an interest in doing so. This struggle against domination can sometimes itself take an instrumental form. But when it involves normative solidarity, it is properly understood as motivated by a shared interest in justice rather than simply the pursuit of benefits. As I have suggested, the classic account of solidarity in this sense is that of labor movement solidarity, but similar notions have characterized a range of social movements, e.g., in Latin America and elsewhere, whether aimed at agrarian reform or at overcoming authoritarian rule, where they take the form also of democratic movements. I propose that these examples, with the processive and critical notion of solidarity they imply, have implications for an adequate conception of solidarity for healthcare and for its applications there. Before turning to this socially critical notion of solidarity, we can note a drawback in the standard reading that takes solidarity as a unitary notion within a single group or community like the nation-state. Insofar as the group is limited to compatriots, or to members of smaller pre-existing groups, it evidently does not address the needs or vulnerabilities of others situated outside these groups' borders. Although there may be unitary groups or communities that are transnational, within which traditional forms of solidarity can be found, increasingly we see that cross-border or transnational relationships take a networked form and involve relations to 'outsiders'. What sorts of solidarities are possible there both generally and in the context of healthcare? Some bioethicists have recently addressed this issue by introducing a notion of human solidarity or global solidarity. In the analysis given by Gunson, the notion of solidarity held to be suitable for global contexts and seen as underlying the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights is explicitly understood as 'weak solidarity,' namely, 'the willingness to take the perspective of others seriously.' It does not add the requirement 'to act in support of it,' which he holds is characteristic of 'strong solidarity,' such as is involved in political solidarities or in social movements to counter exploitation or achieve justice. Gunson explicates weak solidarity as involving listening to others and 'caring for others,' but not necessarily as including efforts at reducing inequalities, or even a specific concern with those. He sees the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights as appealing to a notion of human dignity, but seems to think that weak solidarity is sufficient to respect and uphold that dignity. I would suggest that the appropriate sense of dignity is the robust and demanding one that we find explicitly enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, where dignity is taken in an egalitarian sense, and is held to imply certain labor rights, along with health itself as a human right. A related notion of dignity is likewise appealed to numerous times in the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, which also includes a specific reference to solidarity, as a goal of international cooperation, along with demands on governments for meeting health research and healthcare needs. But this Declaration could usefully go further to specify some of the practices that would help to realize these aims, and I suggest that strong, rather than weak, forms of solidarity would be required in order to fulfill them, and not merely the caring for and aiding others that Gunson and also Prainsack and Buyx emphasize in their accounts. We can distinguish two main senses of solidarity, as already adumbrated, each of which has import for healthcare and the structural injustice that may constrain it. One sense is unitary solidarity, often taken as pertaining to the relations among citizens within a state, but applying as well to the relations among members of smaller pre-existing groups. The second is what I call networking solidarity, evident when groups (often, though not necessarily, transnational), or sometimes also individuals, link up to work on projects aimed at overcoming oppression or exploitation. The first form of solidarity-unitary group solidarity-is often illustrated with the motto of the three musketeers: 'One for all and all for one,' but that is a rather specific and highly demanding version of it. Nonetheless, it has the advantage of calling attention to solidarity as involving a clear awareness of a 'we' or 'us'. Although some sense of a 'we' can be discerned in both forms of solidarity analyzed here, it applies to each type somewhat differently, as we shall see. In contrast, the individualist approach to solidarity advanced by Prainsack and Buyx tends to diminish the role of shared or collective activity, although it helpfully includes a notion of identification with an other who in their view are aided because they are regarded as 'similar in some respect.' In the account that I have developed, the first sense of solidarity pertains to relations among co-participants in an ongoing group, oriented to shared goals. Not all of the participants necessarily share all the goals of the group though they are generally committed to the main ones and to the group's persistence and viability as a whole. Note that solidarity here may not always require a pre-existing shared identity or culture (although it often does), but may emerge from the constitution of an ongoing 'we' in the context of collective or group agency. The shared goals of the group are not aggregative, that is, a sum of each individual's similar goals, but arise in common endeavors (normally including a multiplicity of overlapping subordinate goals), where the overarching goals are at least partly constitutive of the group itself. The various aims and goals are not always explicitly reflected on and are often embedded or institutionalized in the practices of the group. While such a conception of solidarity is often thought to be merely descriptive, I see it (as will be the case for the second sense as well) as grounded in a social ontology of what I have called individuals-in-relations, and as having normative dimensions. In this first case of group solidarity, as an instance of what I have elsewhere called 'common activities,' the norms go beyond the commitments involved in the constitution of any group whatever, and extend to the recognition (though often only implicit) of the fundamentally equal status of the individuals who constitute the group as agents. In virtue of this equality, I have argued elsewhere that the members should be granted equal rights to participate in processes of affirming and revising the goals of the group and should also have some say in how the various shared goals are carried out. This follows from an understanding of justice as what I have termed 'equal positive freedom,' or prima facie equal rights to the conditions of self-development, where such social contexts of activity are among these necessary conditions for individuals. In virtue of their equal agency, no individual has a right to dominate others in determining these common activities, that is, they have equal rights of co-determination of them. In this perspective, solidarity can be seen as an integral part of a set of norms that encompasses justice, as requiring the equal freedom of these relational individuals to develop themselves over time, and the norm of democracy, going beyond its traditional meanings of voting and majority rule to include equal rights of participation in co-determining group ends. In this account, which emphasizes people's interdependence and their embodied nature, the sort of mutual support involved in group solidarity emerges as a crucial condition for the self-transformative activity of individuals and for the persistence of the group itself. We can say then that the requirement to realize justice along with a broad range of human rights through solidaristic activity arises from people's interdependence and from the fact that their free development as agents requires a set of conditions, both material and social. Justice calls for the protection of the traditionally recognized negative liberties, but goes beyond it to require the availability of conditions that support people's self-developing activity (both as individuals and as collectives) over time, that is, their positive freedom. Crucial among these conditions are health and healthcare, as well as education and other central social needs. Given the individuals' fundamental equality as agents, with both individual dignity and shared needs, the norm of justice as requiring action to realize equality not only qualifies any potential group solidarity, as it does on the Prainsack and Buyx account, but is properly a core aspect of solidarity itself as a normative practice. From this perspective, the solidarities that obtain within a group not only help to realize justice concretely, but also can be said to constitute 'the other side of justice' (in Habermas's phrase). Solidarity actions not only reflect people's pre-existing feelings of connection to each other, but also can function in practice to solidify their understanding of shared neediness and their interdependence in meeting these needs and pursuing shared goals. The interdependence involved in common endeavors like political communities, together with the equal vulnerability of members of such communities, involves forms of reciprocity and gives rise to the requirement of mutual aid that is characteristic of solidarity. Further, the conditions for the realization of both individual freedom and of the shared goals of the group can in fact be seen to require the absence of domination and exploitation, that is, the overcoming of these one-sided forms of recognition not only in interpersonal relations, but also as they are entrenched in structural or institutional forms. Included here are types of economic functioning that systematically disadvantage large groups of people, along with other forms of institutional discrimination on the basis of race or gender, or other minority characteristics. Although existing solidarity groups are not always fully aware of the relevance to them of overcoming such injustices, I believe that such demands of justice are in fact integral to solidarity as a norm and not external to it, as on the empirically oriented account advanced by Prainsack and Buyx. Moreover, we can see that ongoing (and not merely pre-given) solidaristic social action within a collectivity and community is needed as a way to more fully achieve justice within it. These interrelations between solidarity and justice are even more evident in the second sense of solidarity, which I have called networking solidarities. This second form is most often found in social movements. Conceptually it arises primarily from classic notions of labor solidarity, which I have suggested can be extended to these movements and can even characterize the relations that are increasingly evident among civil society associations, e.g., NGOs. Networking solidarity is a form particularly apt for capturing constructive relations of support toward distantly situated others, but it can also apply within, as well as across, borders. This form of solidarity is generally aimed at overcoming forms of domination and exploitation, but may also include networking to help alleviate suffering. As a relation among groups (or sometimes even among individuals), I have elsewhere argued that it manifests a type of social empathy or the understanding of another group's situation and perspective, but such solidarity does not consist in sentiment per se. Rather, it necessarily involves action or a readiness to take action on behalf of, and in support of, others. Here, too, there is generally a commitment to a common cause, and when properly understood, I think, a commitment to justice. Although this form of solidarity in practice has tended to involve better-off people working to help those who are less advantaged, we can find a form of reciprocity implicit even here, in particular, an expectation of reciprocal action and mutual aid were it needed. More direct reciprocity is evident in traditional labor union solidarity, as well as in some social movements, where the solidarity actions are among people perceived to be similarly situated. In these various cases of networking solidarity, I have argued that normatively solidarity requires deference to the needs and goals of others as they themselves understand them. And ideally, solidarity movements should embody democratic modes of decision making among the participants, given their equal status as members, and their shared commitment to the overarching goals of their movement. Although there are some fully shared goals that motivate these forms of networking solidarity, especially inasmuch as they often take a project-oriented form, different subgroups act to realize these goals in ways they themselves determine, and they liaise or link up with each other to decide how each group can best participate and contribute. As groups or associations of their own, they tend to have their own sets of goals and plans unrelated to these solidarity actions. But they take themselves to be part of the larger movement or set of associations, aimed at overcoming forms of domination or suffering. Moreover, they often make use of online forms of networking and social media to coordinate their efforts with each other, and they offer each other mutual support and encouragement. Although the groups or individuals linking up in these networks can in some sense be regarded as themselves constituting a superordinate group, and thus from an abstract perspective as not being essentially different from the first form of group solidarity, the latter is unitary and understood by the members as a single group, most often pre-existing, while the former involves loose relations among groups (or sometimes also individuals) undertaken for the purpose of a given project or aim. In practice, then, we can regard these two forms of solidarity as distinct, and see them as manifested in two different types of social phenomena. The 'we' in the case of networking solidarity is constructed serially and diversely by its member groups (or individuals), and is oriented to a particular cause. Nonetheless, insofar as they take overcoming domination, oppression, or exploitation as their aim, they are at least partly defined by an egalitarian commitment to justice, and the 'we' should remain open to others similarly committed. It must be granted that labor solidarity and most social movement solidarity have often involved shared interests and an antagonistic relation to others regarded as exploitative or authoritarian. Indeed, the first sense of solidarity, as group solidarity, admits of a similar antagonistic relation to outsiders, e.g., in the case of hostility toward other nation-states. Nonetheless, we can see how normatively each of these forms of solidarity has the potential to develop in ways that are more inclusive rather than exclusive. In the national case this is possible if borders are not understood to reflect unitary shared identities but come to be regarded as contingent and indeed as porous, or at least much more so than at present. Likewise, labor and social movement solidarity are in principle open to all those who wish to join in their efforts to work toward social (and indeed global) justice, even though it must be admitted that in practice those benefiting from exploitation are unlikely to join in. The connection of solidarity to social and global justice suggests the need to theorize more fully how structural or systemic forms of injustice set the frame and motivation for many solidarity movements and can serve to orient their practices. The notion of structural injustice is perhaps most relevant to networking solidarities, especially where they explicitly aim at establishing justice and therefore would have to address such institutional forms of injustice. But this notion can also apply to unitary solidarity groups, if they seek to adequately meet the basic needs and respect the human rights of their members, who are affected by these forms of injustice. That structures or systems may operate so as to consistently produce injustices has been a prime insight in Marxist theories, which highlight the way the capitalist economic system exploits workers, apart from the specific intentions of individuals, who often do not aim at such exploitation. While classical liberal theories tend to put great weight on individual action and intention, the Marxist emphasis on structure and on the functioning of the capitalist system focuses us on the underlying ways in which corporations operate in accordance with the requirement to increase profits by way of the exploitation of labor. Marxist theory also brings to the forefront the notion of objectification. This refers to the significance of the embodiment of intentions and plans in artifacts and on the need to be recognized by others if people are to understand themselves. That is, it introduces elements of externality required for self-transformation, whether individual or cultural. In such an approach, not only the social, but the material, environment for human action can in various ways reflect existing class and other salient group differences. This environment for action also generates steady expectations and encourages certain modes of comportment in people who tend to operate in accordance with prevailing social practices and rules. At the same time, people have the capacity to change these practices and rules over time, though often only through collective choices and action. (This point may not always be duly appreciated in theories of structural injustice themselves.) More contemporary analyses of the structural factors that contribute to injustice, as found for example in the work of Anthony Giddens and Iris Young, cast light on how individuals can reproduce problematic practices through their choices within these structural constraints. While Giddens focused on processes of what he called structuration, Young highlighted consumer choices and other social practices that serve to produce and reproduce injustices, in a certain sense unwittingly, for example, by impacting sweatshop workers at a distance or by limiting access to the existing housing stock. According to Young:Structural injustices are harms that come to people as a result of structural processes in which many people participate. These participants may well be aware that their actions contribute to the processes that produce the outcomes, but for many it is not possible to trace the specific causal relation between their particular actions and some particular part of the outcome. This emphasis on structure, Young argues, turns our attention to 'how the institutions of a society work together to produce outcomes that support or minimize the threat of domination,' where these outcomes largely depend on the social positioning that conditions people's diverse life prospects. In later work, Young's emphasis turns more to the ways that practices that connect people to each other implicate them in these processes of social and structural reproduction. On her view, the connections in which people stand give rise to what she calls a 'forward looking' sense of political responsibility, and evoke the need to stand in solidarity with others. Leaving aside the difficult issue of responsibility, we can observe that focusing primarily on the amorphous practices of social life can lead us away from understanding the workings of contemporary political economy and its detrimental effects on those who lack the power to take any part in determining its direction. I have also criticized a view that would simply characterize everyone-whether workers or top executives-as implicated in these processes and practices, seeing these groups as distinguished only by degree. Rather, some have substantial control over the processes to which others are subjected. But for the purpose of the analysis here, we can take structural or systemic injustice to refer both to the operation of the formal political-economic institutions of capitalism (along with racism and patriarchy), and to the more informal practices and rules of social life, which also contribute to the production and reproduction of inequalities. How, then, are these structures and the injustices they produce connected to solidarity, as analyzed here? Without attempting a thorough account, we can observe that capitalist economic institutions have in fact disrupted earlier forms of solidarity, such as those characteristic of pre-capitalist political economies, marked by what Durkheim called mechanical solidarity. At the same time, new forms of solidarity have been created, e.g., through the division of labor (as described in Durkheim's term organic solidarity). In political contexts as well, older solidarities within local communities have tended to give way to national, or even transnational, forms. Yet, of greater relevance for us here are the ways in which political economic institutions, with the inequalities and forms of domination and exploitation they may generate, frame and motivate new solidarity movements to address these injustices. Recognizing how institutions and practices function in ways that assign differential power to various groups in society is essential if justice is to be constructed through solidaristic action. Even where solidarity actions aim only at relieving suffering and do not directly attempt to eliminate oppression or explanation, some understanding of the social and institutional context of those to be aided is needed if the solidarity actions are to be effective. For example, efforts to address the aftermath of hurricanes and also to mitigate them going forward call for attention to the social conditions that lead impoverished or minority groups to be disproportionately affected by such natural events-by reason of where they live, or the ways they lack protection against excessive damage from these natural events. In such situations, empathy with the situation of others, and even specific action to assist them, however important they may be, are insufficient unless they are coupled with an understanding of the impacts of the structural features of political economy and the injustices to which the operations of these institutions give rise. This is even more evidently the case where solidarity movements aim directly at overcoming oppression and exploitation, e.g., ending sweatshop labor. In such cases, effective action must not only support workers individually or remedy their specific situation but requires a socially critical analysis of the prevailing context that gives rise to the exploitation in the first place, which may also provide indications of how to address it. We can grant that solidaristic practices, whether in healthcare or other contexts, may well have their own utility as an expression of our sociality and our enjoyment of acting in common, and in this sense solidarity can even be said to have some value apart from its functioning to help in constructing justice. But the argument here is that these practices can be truly effective in meeting their aims only if they go well beyond charity and also beyond practices that simply 'incur costs to assist others recognized as similar' (in the Prainsack/Buyx formulation). If they are to conduce toward justice, these solidarity practices and movements need to address the ways that social, economic, and political institutions systematically function to deny some groups of people the basic means of life, and give rise to pervasive inequalities in people's opportunities for self-development and for participating in processes of collective self-determination. This is the case most clearly for what I have called networking solidarities, but it can apply to solidarity within more unitary contexts like nation-states to the degree that the bonds involved (e.g., among citizens) are not merely pre-existing but affirmed and reinvented over time. Even more demandingly, at a normative level, we can say that solidaristic action needs to take seriously the requirement for deep social transformation in the direction of social, and indeed global, justice. In this way, as I have argued elsewhere, although solidarity remains particularistic in its orientation to specific problems and specific groups or individuals, it can keep in view the demands of universal human dignity. And solidarity movements can verify that their particular goals contribute (in however limited a way) to the broader goal of egalitarian social transformation. Thus, dispositions to empathy, deference, and mutual aid remain important components of solidaristic social action, but a critical analysis of the social context and concretely taking action oriented to alleviating structural injustices are needed as well. In addition, since the institutional context, with its given power relations, frames the various solidarity movements, sometimes the prevailing power formations are replicated within these movements themselves. I suggest that this calls for groups and agents to be self-reflective about these effects of the structural context in which they function, and to be on guard about the dangers of their own possible complicity in its replication and perpetuation. An important proviso should be mentioned before returning to the case of healthcare and considering the impact of the notions of solidarity analyzed here. That is, although solidarity has here been related to justice, with the concomitant need to analyze and address the structural injustices that frame solidarity action, there is no implication that solidarity movements or other solidarity activities are sufficient for achieving the institutional changes that justice requires. For that, democratic legislation and various political and economic transformations are also needed. But solidarity, whether binding the members of a nation-state, or interpreted in newer networking forms, are one important way of constructing the conditions for these transformations, or even, in some cases of prefiguring more just relations within the social relations of solidarity themselves. There is no question that the new focus on solidarity holds considerable import for healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx have effectively argued. But the issue for us is what further benefit would result from incorporating solidarity's connection to justice, holding in view the significance of countering structural or systemic injustices. Given the vast range and specifics of healthcare and the social and economic factors conducive to health, I will focus on only a few of the most obvious implications for the practice of healthcare and for the potentially solidaristic activities of practitioners. We can ask: what difference would it make if we take seriously the need to address the differential structural power of the individuals and groups involved in healthcare, whether as practitioners or those served by them? And what is the scope and nature of the solidarity thus required? I will suggest in this final section that understanding solidarity in relation to structural injustice can not only shed new light on the sorts of examples that Prainsack and Buyx consider, but also, more importantly perhaps, highlight an entirely different range of examples of healthcare solidarity from the ones those authors consider. It takes us beyond such cases as the readiness to assist others through participating in healthcare databases or biobanks to cases of active participation in social movements aimed at improving healthcare nationally or transnationally, or, more defensively, to protesting structural injustices that lead to the wrongful denial of healthcare or to deep inequalities in its allocation. An obvious case of structural injustice in healthcare is provided by the deficiencies evident in the U.S. health insurance system (or lack of a system). Europeans have long recognized the centrality of solidarity with fellow citizens needed to undergird a willingness to contribute through taxes to a universal healthcare system. The types of provision in fact vary considerably, from socialized medicine as in the UK to state-funded support for private insurance provision, as in the Netherlands, along with dual systems mixing public and private support. But the universality at which these systems aim reflects the recognition of people's shared vulnerabilities in matters of health, and even an understanding that healthcare is a human right required by justice. There is also the acknowledgement that systematic or structural provision (or at least a guarantee) of healthcare is required in order to realize the universality at stake here. It is perhaps worth mentioning that despite their achievements, structural injustices do nonetheless persist in many of the European systems themselves. This is particularly the case where there are two tiers of provision such that private insurance is needed in order to gain superior care that (ideally at least) should be available to all. (Granted that in some European countries the public providers may actually be superior to private ones in some respects.) The lack of universal healthcare in the United States is evidently primarily due to the existence of structural injustice, rather than simply reflecting an absence of solidarity among compatriots. To state the obvious: the U.S. private insurance industry-and especially its leading large for-profit companies-is immensely powerful and, currently at least, enormously profitable. As part of the dominion of capitalist economic forms, these private firms also have inordinate influence over politics, as do the large drug companies. The activities of these companies exemplify the role of the 'power of money' that is widely prevalent in U.S. politics and society, which in turn circumscribes the possibilities for public policy and law. Corporate lobbying and campaign contributions from corporations and the wealthy notably undercut political equality in the United States and can also prevent attention to the basic tasks involved in meeting human needs in equitable ways. Beyond this, it can be argued that the systematic differences between people's starting positions, depending on their class and race, in large measure fall out of existing economic functioning, particularly given the resistance of the powerful to the redistributions that would be needed for genuinely equal opportunities. Moreover, these differential and deleterious starting positions conduce to worse health outcomes for children affected by them, and for many adults over the course of their lives. In view of this systemic injustice, the sort of solidarity needed, then, is not only an empathic identification with other citizens (or better, with all members of the political community, including non-citizens). Rather, for meaningful change, attention also needs to be paid to the structural barriers to equal and universal healthcare. Although improvements and reforms can probably be made even without fundamental changes in these background structural economic and political conditions, realizing the goal of genuinely equal treatment would require transforming those basic economic structures themselves. And this in turn calls for social movements aimed at these transformations. In the case of the United States, some healthcare workers in fact have taken the lead in solidarity actions to preserve the existing limited forms of health insurance against efforts to strip vulnerable people of their coverage altogether. This represents an example of a type of solidarity action in the service of justice. Needless to say, much more needs to be done to develop a fully critical solidarity movement of the sort required. Indeed, some healthcare worker groups-notably National Nurses United and Physicians for Universal Healthcare-have taken the lead in spearheading the movement for Medicare for All, going considerably beyond the efforts to prevent repeal of the Affordable Care Act. They originally argued for a public option when that healthcare law was under development, and have gone on to organize healthcare consumers in various locales across the United States, including rural areas and those with large industries, to press for systemic changes in health insurance and in healthcare delivery, such as through establishing non-profit community health centers. In both domestic contexts and more global ones, connecting solidarity to structural injustice has been important for understanding and addressing the social and economic factors that greatly magnify the health impacts of natural disasters, e.g., of hurricanes or tsunamis or volcanic eruptions. Whereas solidarity with affected people has most often been episodic and motivated by empathy with them, attention to the structural factors that exacerbate the impact of these disasters on vulnerable populations expands the scope of what needs to be done in a forward-looking justice-oriented perspective. As suggested earlier, structural injustices that lead impoverished people to live in weak dwellings or in insecure geographical areas also expose them differentially to the health and other effects of weather or environmental catastrophes. Beyond the specific catastrophes, we can see that climate change itself has greater impacts on those groups as well, effects that will only increase over time. Cases that illustrate the ways that structural injustices intensify natural disasters (if not also contributing to causing them) are manifold, and the solidarity movements that have responded to these disasters are instructive for our purposes. A well known case is Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, where African Americans made up 80% of the people in flooded low-lying communities, sometimes residing in inadequate housing like trailers, and without the means to escape the rising waters (especially due to low rates of car ownership). Not only did these minority communities bear the large part of the deaths and injuries from the hurricane, but also they experienced abiding health problems, e.g., those due to mold. Yet, despite the grossly inadequate federal response to this disaster, residents offered each other mutual assistance and were also aided by solidarity groups like Common Ground, which helped with community rebuilding, including founding a free health clinic, and aiding with wetlands restoration. A related example is the response to Hurricane Sandy in the New York/New Jersey area, where healthcare workers set up free clinics in trucks, and helped to raise money for much needed medical supplies for the various communities that lacked adequate resources of their own to deal with the storm aftermath. Internationally, structural injustices significantly contributed to the grave impact of the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, in which over 200,000 people were killed and over 300,000 injured, with more than 1.5 million rendered homeless. Before the quake, many Haitians were impoverished and lived in slum conditions, leaving them highly vulnerable to floods and other natural disasters. The International Monetary Fund had implemented austerity programs in the preceding decades, which contributed to an evisceration of the public health systems and in turn to the health crisis following the earthquake, where there were radically insufficient medical supplies available. In the period that preceded the quake, an estimated 75% of Haiti's healthcare services had been provided by multinational and faith-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and its entire health supply system was externally run. The aid following the quake likewise involved a massive influx of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), but Haitian NGOs were marginalized, as were the Haitian authorities, and over 90% of the aid money went to international actors, including the UN and INGOs, and to the private sector. This aid, too, was unequally distributed between the capital and rural areas, and between well-off and less well-off areas of Port-au-Prince itself. In contrast, more adequately addressing the medical needs arising from the quake, some international healthcare NGOs succeeded in working in solidarity with local Haitians, in particular, the INGO Partners in Health, which explicitly incorporated a focus on the impacts of structural factors in their efforts. A more recent case is provided by Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in the summer of 2017. This natural disaster likewise calls attention to political economic and social structural factors that greatly aggravated the situation. Years of austerity, this time managed by the U.S. government and banks, along with massive debt, left hospitals without many doctors and with inadequate medical supplies needed to deal with injuries following the storm. Puerto Rico's defective electrical grid also hampered the recovery from the hurricane. The inadequacies of this grid were exacerbated by the freeze imposed on a public infrastructure fund, which was instead used to funnel support to public-private partnerships under the same restructuring program. Moreover, in Puerto Rico, as in Haiti, we observe inequalities in the response to affected communities in the capital vs. in poorer rural areas. Solidarity work by healthcare workers, including doctors from Cuba, along with aid from the Puerto Rican diaspora, has been important in recovery and rebuilding efforts, but has not been able to make up for the lack of support from the U.S. government. It is evident, then, that effective action requires understanding the economic and social factors that condition people's life chances and their health, including the limitations imposed by their places of residence. Indeed, the economic functioning of capitalism seems to be a major causal factor not only in these discrete natural events but also in climate change itself. While no single solidarity movement can counter these structural or systemic effects, establishing a linkage between a particular event and the deeper structural conditions for its differential impact on impoverished or vulnerable populations is important for adequate public policy going forward, and for the provision of the right forms of assistance in the present. It suggests the need for aid that not only restores the situation to the one that preceded the environmental event in question but that establishes a better, and more resilient, situation going forward. Clearly, an interlinking and networking of solidarity movements and of civil society organizations, as well as of public policy, would be necessary for the social transformative changes required. Similar arguments concerning the need for solidarity activity to remedy structural injustices can be advanced in regard to other central national or global health problems: for example, the provision of clean water, as in the case of Flint, Michigan, or the protection of the water supplies from fracking, or from underwater pipelines as in the case of Standing Rock, where there was a substantial solidarity struggle in support of the affected Sioux indigenous people in 2016-2017. Internationally, the health challenges include the need for wider and cheaper provision of drugs to counter HIV-AIDS along with a host of other illnesses; ways of dealing with malaria and with preventable epidemics; providing clean water worldwide; and addressing the range of health issues that result from trafficking, child labor, and slave labor. In all these cases, solidarity movements would need to join up with others working to counter exploitation and the dominion of the profit motive, or struggling to rectify the deep inequalities in social and economic conditions, along with the effects of absolute poverty. Likewise, in regard to the overarching problem of climate change itself, we have already seen the emergence of major transnational solidarity movements, often taking the form of networks of local groups, and including the participation of numerous healthcare workers. Examples are the older Via Campesina, the People's Climate Movement, and 350.org, among many others. In the international context, mention should also be made of the way structural injustice frames medical problems arising from illness and other natural causes, but also those arising from war and other forms of violence. Some solidarity movements in those contexts have focused on offering aid to the injured, as with the 'White Helmets' operating in rebel-held areas of Syria, extracting the living from the rubble following Syrian government bombings. While this group is composed mainly of volunteers and is anti-authoritarian, it otherwise eschews any specific political affiliation. The Kurdish YPG (People's Defense Units) in northern Syria, which also has healthcare units operating in areas under attack, presents a somewhat different case, since it is explicitly anti-capitalist in orientation. However, a full discussion of these complex cases would take us beyond the scope of the present discussion. We can, in conclusion, return to two of the cases analyzed by Prainsack and Buyx and attempt to view them through the lens of structural injustice, with the resulting transformed interpretation of the solidaristic action required in those bioethical contexts. While less dramatic than the leading examples analyzed above, where solidarity needs to be directed explicitly towards countering structural injustices, the Prainsack and Buyx cases pose some interesting issues for consideration. The two applications of solidarity are those of governing health databases (as they put it), and personalized medicine and healthcare. As we have noted, in the course of their acute analysis, Prainsack and Buyx occasionally point to the dangers of the commercial uses of medical databases. But we can ask whether their recognition of these dangers fully informs their own account. Perhaps because they wish to make proposals that can be adopted immediately, the authors employ the notion of solidarity to recommend only modest restrictions on the use of these databases. For example, they urge that their use contribute to some public good at the same time as they retain their commercial or profit-oriented purposes, where these latter can even remain primary. The authors also tend to accept the existing limits on public funding for research as a given, rather than strongly arguing for its expansion by way of solidarity actions, however difficult accomplishing this might be in the present. In fact, the use of health databases for the purpose of private profit is a social choice that a society need not endorse. Likewise, the scope and extent of public funding is also a matter of policy and legislation, even if alternative directions would be difficult to implement in the context of a capitalist political economy. It is constraints posed by the latter that I would highlight in an alternative structural perspective on solidarity, taking us beyond the commitment to assist others that these authors foreground in their analysis. Indeed, one can further argue that the solidarity that Prainsack and Buyx seek, as a willingness to share one's own data in large databases, can actually be undercut by structural injustices. This is evident especially in regard to the potential commercial use of the data. Informed people, aware of the dangers that this background structural feature poses, may well be resistant to taking a chance on acting in the solidaristic ways that these authors recommend. People may be wary of these commercial uses and indeed, may even come to expect them, so they would decide against contributing their own information, despite assurances of confidentiality. In this way, the existing tendency toward an overriding concern with private self-interest is reinforced by the very existence and continuation of these structural background conditions. In this context, efforts to eliminate structural injustice, if effective, could be expected to assist in promoting the sorts of solidarities that Prainsack and Buyx seek. Another specific difference I have with these authors' otherwise excellent account of databases and their governance has to do with their rather puzzling remarks about dealing with the risks that must be accepted by those who contribute their health data to the database. For Prainsack and Buyx, solidarity is supposed to motivate people to provide their own health data to these databases and they argue that only 'broad consent' is needed for the use of this data by researchers rather than more traditional forms of informed consent, which they regard as excessively demanding and costly in this context. The authors propose that less attention should be given to preventing the risks of re-identification (with the potential discrimination that might follow) and more attention given to mitigating or compensating for harms that may accrue to individuals from misuse of their data in the future. This includes, they suggest, making fewer efforts to assure individual consent in a strong sense, and instead placing more emphasis on putting funds aside to remedy harms or injuries arising from misidentification or, more generally, from the misuse of information. I believe that encouraging solidaristic actions and practices of the sort these authors seek to engender would instead be aided by focusing even more than is presently done on preventing and limiting the risks that inevitably attend contributing one's personal health data for use in medical databases. This is so not only for instrumental reasons, namely, because otherwise people will not participate out of (largely rational) fear of these untoward consequences. A greater emphasis on limiting risk is also essential in recognition of the real structural problems that frame these databases, namely, the great commercial potential they hold and their openness to corporate use of the included health information in the interests of profits, along with the deep challenges involved in safeguarding privacy online. These structural features would not be meliorated by the authors' otherwise fine proposals to allow contributors to access their own raw data, and to be informed of possible health impacts on them personally that emerge from the research the databases facilitate. To adequately deal with the various social, technological, and medical challenges posed by these large databanks requires solidarity action in the interest of structural change besides the reforms the authors have sketched. Further, although Prainsack and Buyx helpfully suggest in passing that a few patients should be included among those who serve on the proposed governance boards for large databanks, it seems that the majority on these boards would be made up of standing groups of people whose only requirement is not to have conflicts of interest in regard to the potential uses of the databanks. This delimitation seems insufficient to assure the responsibility owed to the contributors of data, particularly in view of the background functioning of social and economic institutions that give managers and other elites the preponderance of power. Inasmuch as ethics boards are also ruled out by the authors as trustees (because they are overburdened, in their view, or may not be knowledgeable about the specific research in question), it is unclear how these governance boards would best be constituted on their approach. A strongly solidaristic view would require that a substantial number should be drawn from patients or their representatives, though it would clearly also be important to include a sizable number of scientists and other experts. We can see then that quasi-democratic requirements emerge for the governance of these databanks, such that those affected by them would have some say in overseeing them. This follows as well from the feature of deference, which I suggested is an important aspect of an adequate conception of solidarity. Deference is required toward those one is assisting, who should have a major role in specifying their needs and how they want to be assisted. Efforts must thus be made to hear from them systematically. This involves new forms of democratic, or perhaps quasi-democratic, input into the policies or actions in question. I use the qualification 'quasi' here to indicate that the input in question may not always have to be formal, though there is certainly a place for formal rights of participation on governance boards by some representatives of patients or even the public at large. This sort of deference to patients and democratic input by them also casts light on the final example of solidarity in action, drawing again from the Prainsack and Buyx account. They analyze the case of 'personalized medicine' or 'precision medicine,' which most often refers to the use of analytical software and databases to target medicine and healthcare to individuals in ways that are unique to them, e.g., by the use of genomics and through such software systems as IBM's Watson. The authors rightly point out that group characteristics continue to be important to these analyses, since data about groups provide the parameters for evaluating the medical status of individuals. But in personalized or precision medicine, the focus comes to be on the intersection of these group findings within particular differentiated individuals. Moreover, the authors usefully propose to extend the characteristics that are taken into account in personalized practices to include also social ones, as well as individuals' cultural and personal preferences. In regard to the identification of group characteristics and their embodiment in unique ways in individuals, it is clearly important to adopt a socially critical perspective as to what constitutes a relevant group. That is, taking structure into account suggests the importance of becoming aware of social preconceptions and potential bias in the identification of a group. This holds not only for standard ascriptive group identifications along the lines of gender, race, etc., but also of newer sets of subgroups or emerging crosscutting groups. It would also affect the ways both researchers and clinicians identify the social background conditions and the social and cultural preferences of the individuals, if these are to be taken into account and added to personalized medicine and healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx propose. We can delineate one final implication of the importance of participation in healthcare by those affected, which I have suggested follows from a conception of solidarity that includes deference and hearing from others as to how they want to be aided or assisted. Clearly, a fuller view of personalized medicine would not only look at evidence-based therapies targeted at individuals drawing from large databases of relevant research, but should be open to input from patients themselves about the aims and methods of therapy. Even the basic interpretation of health and wellness, both of which are clearly shared goals of patients and clinicians, can be open to patients' input. This sort of participation by those affected by the practice of medicine and healthcare need not be understood in a way that diminishes the role of science or expertise. Rather, it reflects the recognition that solidarity with patients requires openness to their own perspectives and goals, and ideally involves their participation in co-determining their own care. Given the range of research knowledge and existing therapies, a truly personalized medicine would not only home in on targeted precise therapies, but would involve an interactive and cooperative process of health building and health sustenance. As argued here, it would also require practices of attunement to, and solidarity with, a patient's social context, needs, and aspirations. Further, understanding that social context, in turn, requires a focus on the differential power and inequalities that result from prevailing political and economic institutions, that is, an attention to structural injustice.

INTRODUCTION CURRENT INTERPRETATIONS OF SOLIDARITY IN HEALTHCARE TWO SENSES OF SOLIDARITY AND THEIR RELATION TO JUSTICE STRUCTURAL INJUSTICE AND SOLIDARITY SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTHCARE CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature, addressing the motivation for taking seriously the shared vulnerabilities and medical needs of compatriots and for acting to help them meet these needs. In a recent book, Prainsack and Buyx take solidarity as a commitment to bear costs to assist others regarded as similar, with implications for governing health databases, personalized medicine, and organ donation. More broadly, solidarity has been understood normatively to call for 'standing with' or assisting fellow community members and possibly also distant others in regard to their needs, whether for its own sake or in order to realize the demands of justice. I argue here that the understanding of solidarity in the existing bioethics literature is unduly restricted by not sufficiently theorizing the notion of structural (or systemic) injustice and its import for understanding solidarity. Extending traditional conceptions of labor and social movement solidarity, I contrast unitary solidarity within a given group with 'networking solidarities' across groups. I analyze the meaning of structural injustice and its significance for solidarity, including countering institutionally entrenched inequalities and economic exploitation. I then apply this broadened conception to healthcare, discussing structural problems with the U.S. insurance system and the solidarity movements addressing its deficiencies. I analyze some natural disasters and global health challenges that were aggravated by structural injustices, along with the solidarity movements they engendered. Finally, I revisit the questions of governing health databases and of personalized medicine with the enlarged conception of solidarity in view.

J	Voorend, K; Bedi, AS; Sura-Fonseca, R				Voorend, Koen; Bedi, Arjun S.; Sura-Fonseca, Rebeca			Migrants and access to health care in Costa Rica	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Migration; Healthcare; Costa Rica; Nicaragua; Central America	SOCIAL RIGHTS; NICARAGUAN MIGRANTS; IMMIGRATION	As in most immigrant-receiving countries in the global North, countries in the South face challenges regarding migrant access to social rights and the effect of migrants on the sustainability of the welfare state. In the Latin American context, this holds especially for countries such as Costa Rica, which has one of the strongest social policy regimes in the South and the highest (Nicaraguan) immigrant stock in Latin America. Set in the context of Costa Rica, this paper assesses two views which seem hard to reconcile, and, are common in the country. First, it is claimed that Nicaraguan migrants use public health services disproportionately, thereby threatening the country's welfare system. Second, pro-migrant rights non-governmental organizations and academics are concerned, primarily based on qualitative studies, that access to health services for Nicaraguan immigrants is limited, and that they are discriminated based on nationality. This paper relies on administrative data and a unique data set representative of Nicaraguan born individuals residing in Costa Rica to examine the validity of both these claims. We do not find support for either. The incidence of migrant health care use is lower than their share in the population and at the same time there is no evidence of discrimination in health care access for migrants based on their nationality.

Hodgkin lymphoma burden in Central and South America	CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Hodgkin lymphoma; Lymphomas; Central and South America; Incidence; Mortality	EPSTEIN-BARR-VIRUS; B-CELL LYMPHOMA; CANCER-MORTALITY; TIME TRENDS; RISK; DISEASE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CHILDREN; MEXICAN; METAANALYSIS	Rationale and objective: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is largely curable owing to improvements in treatment since the 1960s; nevertheless, high mortality rates have been reported in Central and South America. We describe the current burden of HL in the Central and South American region. Methods: We obtained regional-and national-level incidence data from 48 population-based cancer registries in 13 countries, and national-level mortality data from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries. We estimated world population age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) and agestandardized mortality rates (ASMRs) per 100,000 person-years for 2003-2007 and present distributions by histological subtype. Results: HL incidence rates varied 7-fold in males and 11-fold in females (male-to-female ratio 1: 1-2.5: 1). The highest ASRs were seen Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica (males), Cuba (males) and Uruguay (females), whereas the lowest were in Bolivia and El Salvador. ASMRs varied by 4-fold in males and 6-fold in females (male-to-female ratio 1: 1-4.3: 1), with ASMRs < 0.7 for most countries, except Cuba (>= 1.0). In most countries, age-specific incidence rates of HL showed a bimodal pattern. Trends in HL in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Costa Rica remained stable in 1997-2008. Of all HL cases, 48% were unspecified as to histological subtype. Nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity were the most frequent histologies. Conclusion: The geographic variation in HL across the region may in part reflect differences in data quality and coverage, and differences in the adoption of modern therapies and healthcare access. Our results highlight the need for high-quality data and increased coverage in order to provide vital guidance for future cancer control activities.

J	Sierra, MS; Soerjomataram, I; Forman, D				Sierra, Monica S.; Soerjomataram, Isabelle; Forman, David			Prostate cancer burden in Central and South America	CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Prostate; Neoplasm; Screening; Central and South America	INTERNATIONAL TRENDS; NUTRITION TRANSITION; MORTALITY TRENDS; PATTERNS; SURVIVAL; OBESITY; RISK; PREVALENCE; ETHNICITY; RELATIVES	Rationale and objective: The incidence of prostate cancer has increased in Central and South America (CSA) in the last few decades. We describe the geographical patterns and trends of prostate cancer in CSA. Methods: We obtained regional and national-level cancer incidence data from 48 population-based registries in 13 countries and nation-wide cancer deaths from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries. We estimated world population age-standardized incidence (ASR) and mortality (ASMR) rates per 100,000 person-years for 2003-2007 and the estimated annual percent change (EAPC) to describe time trends. Results: Prostate cancer was the most common cancer diagnosis and one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among males in most CSA countries. From 2003-2007, ASRs varied between countries (6-fold) and within countries (Brazil: 3-6-fold). French Guyana (147.1) and Brazil (91.4) had the highest ASRs whereas Mexico (28.9) and Cuba (24.3) had the lowest. ASMRs varied by 4-fold. Belize, Uruguay and Cuba (24.128.9) had the highest ASMRs while Peru, Nicaragua, and El Salvador (6.8-9.7) had the lowest. In Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Costa Rica prostate cancer incidence increased by 2.8-4.8% annually whereas mortality remained stable between 1997 and 2008. Conclusion: The geographic and temporal variation of prostate cancer rates observed in CSA may in part reflect differences in diagnostic and registration practices, healthcare access, treatment and death certification, and public awareness. The incidence of prostate cancer is expected to increase given recent early detection activities and increased public awareness; however, the impact of these factors on mortality remains to be elucidated.

Female breast cancer in Central and South America	CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Breast; Neoplasm; Screening; Central and South America	LATIN-AMERICA; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; RISK-FACTORS; NUTRITION TRANSITION; MORTALITY-RATES; CERVICAL-CANCER; GLOBAL PATTERNS; LOW-INCOME; TRENDS; DIAGNOSIS	Rationale and objective: The burden of breast cancer has increased worldwide. Breast cancer mortality has been increasing in Central and South America (CSA) in the last few decades. We describe the current burden of breast cancer in CSA and review the current status of disease control. Methods: We obtained regional-and national-level incidence data from 48 population-based cancer registries in 13 countries and cancer deaths from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries. We estimated world population age-standardized incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 person-years for 2003-2007 and the estimated annual percentage change to describe time trends. Results: In the most recent 5-year period, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay had the highest incidence rates (67.7-71.9) and Bolivia and El Salvador had the lowest (7.9-12.7). For most countries, mortality rates were <= 12.3, except in Uruguay, Argentina and Cuba (14.9-20.5). Age-specific rates increased after the age of 40-50 years and reached a maximum after age 65 years (mean age at diagnosis 56-62 years). Most countries have developed national screening guidelines; however, there is limited capacity for screening. Conclusion: The geographic variation of breast cancer rates may be explained by differences in the prevalence of reproductive patterns, lifestyle factors, early detection, and healthcare access. Extending early-detection programs is challenging because of inequalities in healthcare access and coverage, limited funding, and inadequate infrastructure, and thus it may not be feasible. Given the current status of breast cancer in CSA, data generated by population-based cancer registries is urgently needed for effective planning for cancer control.

Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emerging arbovirus of public health concern in the Neotropics and its full impact is yet unknown. Both YFV and MAYV are primarily maintained via a sylvatic transmission cycle but can be opportunistically transmitted to humans by the bites of infected forest dwelling Haemagogus janthinomys Dyar, 1921. To better understand the potential risk of YFV and MAYV transmission to humans, a more detailed understanding of this vector species' distribution is critical. This study compiled a comprehensive database of 177 unique Hg. janthinomys collection sites retrieved from the published literature, digitized museum specimens and publicly accessible mosquito surveillance data. Covariate analysis was performed to optimize a selection of environmental (topographic and bioclimatic) variables associated with predicting habitat suitability, and species distributions modelled across South America using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach. Our results indicate that suitable habitat for Hg. janthinomys can be found across forested regions of South America including the Atlantic forests and interior Amazon. Author summary Mayaro virus is a neglected tropical disease and there is insufficient evidence to define its geographic range. The mosquito Haemagogus janthinomys is a primary vector of Mayaro and its distribution is largely unknown at a sub-country scale. Building compendiums of collection data and creating ecological niche models provides a more precise estimation of vector species potential habitat. Our dataset stands as one of the most expansive existing for collection data of this species combining data published in literature, publicly available data repositories and digitized museum specimen records. Comparing results of niche models with near real time environmental data can give even better predictions of areas where Mayaro virus exposure could occur. The methods and results of this study can be replicated for any disease/vector of interest so long as there is data discoverable through the scientific literature, public repositories, or other civilian and governmental agencies willing to share.

To demonstrate the importance of country surveillance systems for leptospirosis and their use for preliminary epidemiological analysis, as well as to generate research questions for future, more comprehensive studies on the disease. Methods. In 2015, for the first time, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) included human cases of leptospirosis in its Regional Core Health Data Initiative, an open-access database that collects annual health indicators from the countries and territories of the Americas. This new information was used to analyze leptospirosis cases by country and sex and to calculate cumulative incidence rates. Maps were used to help present the results. To supplement that general review of leptospirosis in the Americas, more detailed descriptions of the epidemiological situation and the surveillance programs of four selected countries (Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, and Honduras) were provided. Results. In this first year of PAHO requesting leptospirosis data, of the 49 countries and territories in the Americas, 38 of them (77.6%) reported information. Among those 38, 28 of them (73.7%) reported the presence of human cases; the majority of instances of zero cases were in Caribbean territories. From those 28, a total of 10 702 human cases were recorded. The largest numbers of cases in Latin America were in Brazil (40.2%), Peru (23.6%), Colombia (8.8%), and Ecuador (7.2%). The cumulative incidence rate for Latin America was estimated to be 2.0 per 100 000 population. On average, 65.1% of cases were males. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that many countries in Latin America are making efforts to establish strong surveillance systems and programs for leptospirosis. The study also shows the importance of having leptospirosis surveillance systems as well as how the in formation generated can be used for evidence-based decision-making on leptospirosis.

J	Clemente, L; Lu, F; Santillana, M				Clemente, Leonardo; Lu, Fred; Santillana, Mauricio			Improved Real-Time Influenza Surveillance: Using Internet Search Data in Eight Latin American Countries	JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE			English	Article						google flu trends; influenza monitoring; real-time disease surveillance; digital epidemiology; influenza; human; developing countries; machine learning	FLU	Background: Novel influenza surveillance systems that leverage Internet-based real-time data sources including Internet search frequencies, social-network information, and crowd-sourced flu surveillance tools have shown improved accuracy over the past few years in data-rich countries like the United States. These systems not only track flu activity accurately, but they also report flu estimates a week or more ahead of the publication of reports produced by healthcare-based systems, such as those implemented and managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Previous work has shown that the predictive capabilities of novel flu surveillance systems, like Google Flu Trends (GFT), in developing countries in Latin America have not yet delivered acceptable flu estimates. Objective: The aim of this study was to show that recent methodological improvements on the use of Internet search engine information to track diseases can lead to improved retrospective flu estimates in multiple countries in Latin America. Methods: A machine learning-based methodology that uses flu-related Internet search activity and historical information to monitor flu activity, named ARGO (AutoRegression with Google search), was extended to generate flu predictions for 8 Latin American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay) for the time period: January 2012 to December of 2016. These retrospective (out-of-sample) Influenza activity predictions were compared with historically observed flu suspected cases in each country, as reported by Flunet, an influenza surveillance database maintained by the World Health Organization. For a baseline comparison, retrospective (out-of-sample) flu estimates were produced for the same time period using autoregressive models that only leverage historical flu activity information. Results: Our results show that ARGO-like models' predictive power outperform autoregressive models in 6 out of 8 countries in the 2012-2016 time period. Moreover, ARGO significantly improves on historical flu estimates produced by the now discontinued GFT for the time period of 2012-2015, where GFT information is publicly available. Conclusions: We demonstrate here that a self-correcting machine learning method, leveraging Internet-based disease-related search activity and historical flu trends, has the potential to produce reliable and timely flu estimates in multiple Latin American countries. This methodology may prove helpful to local public health officials who design and implement interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of influenza outbreaks. Our methodology generally outperforms both the now-discontinued tool GFT, and autoregressive methodologies that exploit only historical flu activity to produce future disease estimates.

Between 2012 and 2021, the number of deceased and injured motorcyclists among all road users was 50%, with an annual average of 3140 fatal victims and 20,800 injured victims. Bogota, Cali, and Medellin were the cities with the most accidents. In Bogota in 2017, the deaths of motorcyclists on the roads were around 32% of the road actors. This data article presents the dataset used to analyze and predict the severity of motorcyclist road accidents in Bogota in the article entitled "Extraction of decision rules using genetic algorithms and simulated annealing for prediction of severity of traffic accidents by motorcyclists" [1] . The data set was consolidated from the registration of 175,245 traffic accidents and the report of 337,828 road actors involved in crashes in Bogota between January 2013 and February 2018. The data was compiled, processed, and enriched with additional information about infrastructure and weather conditions. The data corresponds to 35,693 motorcyclist traffic accidents, represented by 28 variables, and classified into five categories: road actors, motorcyclists and individuals involved, weather conditions and timing, road conditions and location and characteristics of the accident. The data on motorcyclist traffic accidents opens up a scenario to deepen and compare road safety in Latin America, where studies on vulnerable road users are limited. According to severity, the data on motorcycle traffic accidents recorded 28% with material damage, 69% with injured and 3% with fatal victims. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this context, a comprehensive emission inventory for South America was developed on the basis of the existing data on the global dataset CAMS-GLOB-ANT v4.1 (developed by joining CEDS trends and EDGAR v4.3.2 historical data), enriching it with data derived from locally available emission inventories for Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. This work presents the results of the first joint effort of South American researchers and European colleagues to generate regional maps of emissions, together with a methodological approach to continue incorporating information into future versions of the dataset. This version of the PAPILA dataset includes CO, NOx, NMVOCs, NH3, and SO2 annual emissions from anthropogenic sources for the period 2014-2016, with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees over a domain that covers 32-120 degrees W and 34 degrees N-58 degrees S. The PAPILA dataset is presented as netCDF4 files and is available in an open-access data repository under a CC-BY 4 license: . A comparative assessment of PAPILA-CAMS datasets was carried out for (i) the South American region, (ii) the countries with local data (Argentina, Colombia, and Chile), and (iii) downscaled emission maps for urban domains with different environmental and anthropogenic factors. Relevant differences were found at both country and urban levels for all the compounds analyzed. Among them, we found that when comparing PAPILA total emissions versus CAMS datasets at the national level, higher levels of NOx and considerably lower levels of the other species were obtained for Argentina, higher levels of SO2 and lower levels of CO and NOx for Colombia, and considerably higher levels of CO, NMVOCs, and SO2 for Chile. These discrepancies are mainly related to the representativeness of local practices in the local emission estimates, to the improvements made in the spatial distribution of the locally estimated emissions, or to both. Both datasets were evaluated against surface concentrations of CO and NOx by using them as input data to the WRF-Chem model for one of the analyzed domains, the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, for summer and winter of 2015. PAPILA-based modeling results had a smaller bias for CO and NOx concentrations in winter while CAMS-based results for the same period tended to deliver an underestimation of these concentrations. Both inventories exhibited similar performances for CO in summer, while the PAPILA simulation outperformed CAMS for NOx concentrations. These results highlight the importance of refining global inventories with local data to obtain accurate results with high-resolution air quality models.

Global digital social learning as a strategy to promote engagement in the era of COVID-19	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						COVID-19; global health; Massive Open Online Course; social learning		Aims and objectives To assess formative and summative milestones in a digital course and the reach to low- and middle-income countries of a Massive Open Online Course focussing on supporting nurses dealing with an emerging pandemic. Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has ravaged the globe and increased the need for timely and accurate information from reliable sources. Access to reliable and accurate information, as well as support, is important in achieving health systems strengthening. Using a Massive Open Online Course format, an educational resource aimed at large-scale interactive participation via the Internet, and participants were engaged in a course focussing on nursing in a time of crisis and involved using social learning principles. Design Observational descriptive study. Method Routinely collected data were collated during the period of 18 May-18 July 2020 focused on both formative and summative milestones in the course. Data were separated and classified by income in accordance with the publicly accessible 2020 World Bank Open Dataset. Results During the 2-month period of observation (18 May-18 July 2020), 10,130 individuals from 156 countries enrolled in the course. More than 51% of participants were Active Learners. Thirty per cent completed over 90% of the course content by the end. There was widespread distribution of learners in low- and middle-income countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of reliable and valid information sources. The use of Massive Open Online Course format can facilitate dissemination. Relevance to clinical practice In the context of a dynamic global pandemic, leveraging digital resources to allow access to reliable information and resources is important. Incentivising participation through recognition of learning is important. Engaging in a social learning platform also has the power for reflection, promotion of resilience and capacity for health systems strengthening.

The mantisGRID is a GRID platform, based on open source grid infrastructure that provides the necessary services to access and exchange medical images and associated information following digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) and health level 7 standards. The paper focuses first on the data abstraction architecture, which is achieved via Open Grid Services Architecture Data Access and Integration (OGSA-DAI) services and supported by the Globus Toolkit. The grid currently uses a 30-Mb bandwidth of the Colombian High Technology Academic Network, RENATA, connected to Internet 2. It also includes a discussion on the relational database created to handle the DICOM objects that were represented using Extensible Markup Language Schema documents, as well as other features implemented such as data security, user authentication, and patient confidentiality. Grid performance was tested using the three current operative nodes and the results demonstrated comparable query times between the mantisGRID (OGSA-DAI) and Distributed mySQL databases, especially for a large number of records.

Despite the increasing number of solutions based on the openEHR specifications, it is difficult to find publicly available healthcare datasets in the openEHR format that can be used to test, compare and validate different data persistence mechanisms for openEHR. To foster research on openEHR servers, we present the openEHR Benchmark Dataset, ORBDA, a very large healthcare benchmark dataset encoded using the openEHR formalism. To construct ORBDA, we extracted and cleaned a de-identified dataset from the Brazilian National Healthcare System (SUS) containing hospitalisation and high complexity procedures information and formalised it using a set of openEHR archetypes and templates. Then, we implemented a tool to enrich the raw relational data and convert it into the openEHR model using the openEHR Java reference model library. The ORBDA dataset is available in composition, versioned composition and EHR openEHR representations in XML and JSON formats. In total, the dataset contains more than 150 million composition records. We describe the dataset and provide means to access it. Additionally, we demonstrate the usage of ORBDA for evaluating inserting throughput and query latency performances of some NoSQL database management systems. We believe that ORBDA is a valuable asset for assessing storage models for openEHR-based information systems during the software engineering process. It may also be a suitable component in future standardised benchmarking of available openEHR storage platforms.

Globally, over 314.019.135 confirmed cases and 5.507.370 deaths have been recorded at 12 January 2022, based on the Dashboard updated by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The continuous rise in the number of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic patients has developed efficient and accessible models for prediction using Open Source Libraries and Cloud Services. This paper proposes different machine-learning algorithms to analyse the COVID-19 OpenData Resources from Mexico and Brazil, which represent the two major populations, economics and affected by disease countries in Latin America. This model uses only the COVID-19 patient's geographical, social conditions, economics conditions, clinical risk factors, symptom reports, and demographic data to predict recovery and death. The model of Mexico has an accuracy of 93% and the perceived mean of recall and the precision (F1 Score) of 0.79 on the dataset used. On the other hand, the model of Brazil has an accuracy of 69% and F1 score of 0.75 on the dataset studied. The result considers data from patients under the age of 0 and 120 years. The contribution of the work is the application of Big Data technologies and Machine Learning algorithms using Open Resource Libraries and Amazon Web Services (AWS) with the vision to improve the clinical diagnosis, even infectious disease with mathematical approaches.

Plagiarism Allegations Account for Most Retractions in Major Latin American/Caribbean Databases	SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS			English	Article						Retractions; Plagiarism; Research integrity; Research misconduct; Correction of the literature	PUBLICATION MISCONDUCT; OPEN-ACCESS; ARTICLES	This study focuses on retraction notices from two major Latin American/Caribbean indexing databases: SciELO and LILACS. SciELO includes open scientific journals published mostly in Latin America/the Caribbean, from which 10 % are also indexed by Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge Journal of Citation Reports (JCR). LILACS has a similar geographical coverage and includes dissertations and conference/symposia proceedings, but it is limited to publications in the health sciences. A search for retraction notices was performed in these two databases using the keywords "retracted", "retraction" "withdrawal", "withdrawn", "removed" and "redress". Documents were manually checked to identify those that actually referred to retractions, which were then analyzed and categorized according to the reasons alleged in the notices. Dates of publication/retraction and time to retraction were also recorded. Searching procedures were performed between June and December 2014. Thirty-one retraction notices were identified, fifteen of which were in JCR-indexed journals. "Plagiarism" was alleged in six retractions of this group. Among the non-JCR journals, retraction reasons were alleged in fourteen cases, twelve of which were attributed to "plagiarism". The proportion of retracted articles for the SciELO database was approximately 0.005 %. The reasons alleged in retraction notices may be used as signposts to inform discussions in Latin America on plagiarism and research integrity.

Machine learning-based colorectal cancer prediction using global dietary data	BMC CANCER			English	Article						Colorectal cancer; Machine learning; Dietary information	RISK	BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Active health screening for CRC yielded detection of an increasingly younger adults. However, current machine learning algorithms that are trained using older adults and smaller datasets, may not perform well in practice for large populations.AimTo evaluate machine learning algorithms using large datasets accounting for both younger and older adults from multiple regions and diverse sociodemographics.MethodsA large dataset including 109,343 participants in a dietary-based colorectal cancer ase study from Canada, India, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States was collected by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This global dietary database was augmented with other publicly accessible information from multiple sources. Nine supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms were evaluated on the aggregated dataset.ResultsBoth supervised and unsupervised models performed well in predicting CRC and non-CRC phenotypes. A prediction model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) was found to be the optimal algorithm with CRC misclassification of 1% and non-CRC misclassification of 3%.ConclusionsANN models trained on large heterogeneous datasets may be applicable for both younger and older adults. Such models provide a solid foundation for building effective clinical decision support systems assisting healthcare providers in dietary-related, non-invasive screening that can be applied in large studies. Using optimal algorithms coupled with high compliance to cancer screening is expected to significantly improve early diagnoses and boost the success rate of timely and appropriate cancer interventions.

Despite great advances in health-care services and cardiac surgical care in both its public and private health systems, little is known on the volume, outcomes, and trends of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in Brazil's public health system. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of CABG on the public health system from January 2008 to December 2017 through the database DATASUS. Methods: This study is based on publicly available material obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian Ministry of Health's data processing system, on numbers of surgical procedures, death rates, length of stay, and costs. Only isolated CABG procedures were included in our study. We used the TabNet software from the DATASUS website to generate reports. The chi(2) test was used to compare death rates. A p < .05 was considered statistically significant. Results: We identified 226,697 CABG procedures performed from January 2008 to December 2017. The overall in-hospital mortality over the 10-year period was 5.7%. We observed statistically significant differences in death rates between the five Brazilian macro-regions. Death rates by state ranged from 2.6% to 13.1%. The national average mortality rate remained stable over the course of time. Conclusion: Over 10 years, a high volume of CABG was performed in the Brazilian Public Health System, with significant differences in mortality, number of procedures, and distribution of surgeries by region. Future databases involving all centers that perform CABG and carry out risk-adjusted analysis will help improve Brazilian results and enable policymakers to adopt appropriate health-care policies for greater transparency and accountability.

Contemporary data on the cancer burden aims to inform effective cancer policies; this article provides an update and benchmarking of national cancer incidence and mortality estimates for the year 2020, alongside recent mortality trends in the region. Methods The number of new cancer cases and deaths were extracted from the GLOBOCAN 2020 database developed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and mortality data over time from IARC's cancer mortality database, New cancer cases, deaths and corresponding age-standardized rates per 100,000 person-years are presented. Random fluctuations in mortality trends by country, sex and cancer site were smoothed using LOWE-SS regression. Findings An estimated total of 1.5 million new cancer cases and 700,000 deaths occur annually in LAC, with corresponding incidence and mortality rates of 186.5 and 86.6 per 100,000. The most common cancers in 2020 were prostate (15%), breast (14%), colorectal (9%), lung (7%) and stomach (5%). Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death (12%), though rates varied substantially between countries. The mortality trends of infectious-related cancers tended to decline in most countries, while rates of cancer types linked to westernization were mainly increasing. Assuming rates remain unchanged, the cancer burden in LAC will increase by 67% reaching 2.4 million new cases annually by 2040. Interpretation The cancer patterns reflect important underlying sociodemographic changes occurring over the last decades.

Modelling geospatial distributions of the triatomine vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi in Latin America	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Article							POINT PROCESS MODELS; HEMIPTERA REDUVIIDAE; CHAGAS-DISEASE; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; EVENTS; TRANSMISSION; ACCURACY; HABITAT; STAL; BIAS	Author summary The Pan American Health Organisation's Strategy and Plan of Action for Chagas Disease Prevention, Control and Care highlights the importance of eliminating those triatomine vector species that colonise homes, and has had great success in many locations. Since indoor residual spraying campaigns have targeted these species, their importance relative to other vectors has diminished and their geographical distributions may also have changed. It is now vital to consider the full community of vector species, including previously dominant vectors as well as secondary or minor vector species, in order to target residual transmission to humans. Our aim was to define the geographical distributions of the most commonly reported triatomine species in the Chagas endemic region from northern Argentina and Chile to the southern United States of America. We extracted reports of triatomine vector species observed at specific locations from a public database and we used a geostatistical model to generate fine-scale predictive maps for thirty triatomine vector species. Data quality and data availability issues necessitate careful interpretation of the results, so (un)certainty intervals are presented alongside each map. We also present these maps alongside a summary of the published evidence for key indicators related to the capacity of each species to transmit the Chagas parasite to humans. This evidence shows that most of the 30 species that we have mapped pose a potential threat to human populations. Approximately 150 triatomine species are suspected to be infected with the Chagas parasite,Trypanosoma cruzi, but they differ in the risk they pose to human populations. The largest risk comes from species that have a domestic life cycle and these species have been targeted by indoor residual spraying campaigns, which have been successful in many locations. It is now important to consider residual transmission that may be linked to persistent populations of dominant vectors, or to secondary or minor vectors. The aim of this project was to define the geographical distributions of the community of triatomine species across the Chagas endemic region. Presence-only data with over 12, 000 observations of triatomine vectors were extracted from a public database and target-group background data were generated to account for sampling bias in the presence data. Geostatistical regression was then applied to estimate species distributions and fine-scale distribution maps were generated for thirty triatomine vector species including those found within one or two countries and species that are more widely distributed from northern Argentina to Guatemala, Bolivia to southern Mexico, and Mexico to the southern United States of America. The results forRhodnius pictipes,Panstrongylus geniculatus,Triatoma dimidiata,Triatoma gerstaeckeri, andTriatoma infestansare presented in detail, including model predictions and (un)certainty in these predictions, and the model validation results for each of the 30 species are presented in full. The predictive maps for all species are made publicly available so that they can be used to assess the communities of vectors present within different regions of the endemic zone. The maps are presented alongside key indicators for the capacity of each species to transmitT. cruzito humans. These indicators include infection prevalence, evidence for human blood meals, and colonisation or invasion of homes. A summary of the published evidence for these indicators shows that the majority of the 30 species mapped by this study have the potential to transmitT. cruzito humans.

We offer a machine-readable and open-access dataset on primary health care coverage in Brazil from 1998 to 2020. This dataset is interoperable with epidemiological data from two major studies and reusable by the research community worldwide for other purposes, such as monitoring progress toward universal health coverage and studying the association between primary health care and health outcomes.Data descriptionThe dataset gathers official and public information from the "e-Gestor AB" platform of the Ministry of Health of Brazil and restricted data obtained by the Brazilian Access to Information Law.

The changing dynamics of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1: Next steps for management & science in North America	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Avian influenza; Disease management; Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus; Poultry; Clade 2; 3; 4; 4b; Structured decision making; Wild birds	EXPERT ELICITATION; VIRUSES; MORTALITY; EVOLUTION; INFECTION; GENE	Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 was introduced in North America in late 2021 through trans-Atlantic pathways via migratory birds. These introductions have resulted in an unprecedented epizootic, a widespread disease event in animals, heavily affecting poultry, wild birds, and recently mammals. The North American incursions occurred during the largest epidemic season (2021-2022) in Europe where H5N1 may now be endemic (i.e., continuously present). The continuing outbreak includes expansion into Mexico, Central and South America beginning in late 2022. Here, we provide an overview of the Eurasian origin H5N1 introduction to the Americas, including a significant shift in virus dynamics and severe disease in wild birds. Then, to investigate the global changes in confirmed detections in wild birds and poultry across time and geographic regions, we analyzed FAO's EMPRES-i + database. To examine the 2021 introduction and spread in North American wild birds and poultry, we collated publicly available data across USA and Canadian federal sources. Based on our assessment, the unique magnitude of the North American H5N1 spread indicates the need for effective decision framing to prioritize management needs and scientific inquiry, particularly for species at risk and interface areas for wildlife, poultry, and humans. We illustrate the rapidly occurring and likely increasing detrimental effects that this One Health issue has on wildlife, agriculture, and potentially human health, and we offer a reframing of HPAIV disease response towards a decision analytical context to guide scientific prioritization as a potentially valuable change in focus.

However, Venezuela's ongoing humanitarian crisis has decimated its health care system, and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border, and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region. Methods: We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages 'Pangolin' tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference. Results: We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes. Additionally, three mutations (R203K/G204R substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome. Conclusions: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil, consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns. The presence of mutations associated with increased infectivity in the 3 Venezuelan genomes we report and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from neighboring borders areas may pose additional challenges for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the complex epidemiological landscape in Latin American countries. Public health authorities should carefully follow the progress of the pandemic and its impact on displaced populations within the region.

J	Keast, M; Bonacci, J; Fox, A				Keast, Meghan; Bonacci, Jason; Fox, Aaron			Geometric variation of the human tibia-fibula: a public dataset of tibia-fibula surface meshes and statistical shape model	PEERJ			English	Article						Musculoskeletal model; Lower extremity; Statistical shape modelling; Bone model	STRESS-FRACTURE; INJURIES; RISK	Background: Variation in tibia geometry is a risk factor for tibial stress fractures. Geometric variability in bones is often quantified using statistical shape modelling. Statistical shape models (SSM) offer a method to assess three-dimensional variation of structures and identify the source of variation. Although SSM have been used widely to assess long bones, there is limited open-source datasets of this kind. Overall, the creation of SSM can be an expensive process, that requires advanced skills. A publicly available tibia shape model would be beneficial as it enables researchers to improve skills. Further, it could benefit health, sport and medicine with the potential to assess geometries suitable for medical equipment, and aid in clinical diagnosis. This study aimed to: (i) quantify tibial geometry using a SSM; and (ii) provide the SSM and associated code as an open-source dataset.Methods: Lower limb computed tomography (CT) scans from the right tibia -fibula of 30 cadavers (male n = 20, female n = 10) were obtained from the New Mexico Decedent Image Database. Tibias were segmented and reconstructed into both cortical and trabecular sections. Fibulas were segmented as a singular surface. The segmented bones were used to develop three SSM of the: (i) tibia; (ii) tibia -fibula; and (iii) cortical-trabecular. Principal component analysis was applied to obtain the three SSM, with the principal components that explained 95% of geometric variation retained.Results: Overall size was the main source of variation in all three models accounting for 90.31%, 84.24% and 85.06%. Other sources of geometric variation in the tibia surface models included overall and midshaft thickness; prominence and size of the condyle plateau, tibial tuberosity, and anterior crest; and axial torsion of the tibial shaft. Further variations in the tibia -fibula model included midshaft thickness of the fibula; fibula head position relative to the tibia; tibia and fibula anterior-posterior curvature; fibula posterior curvature; tibia plateau rotation; and interosseous width. The main sources of variation in the cortical-trabecular model other than general size included variation in the medulla cavity diameter; cortical thickness; anterior-posterior shaft curvature; and the volume of trabecular bone in the proximal and distal ends of the bone.Conclusion: Variations that could increase the risk of tibial stress injury were observed, these included general tibial thickness, midshaft thickness, tibial length and medulla cavity diameter (indicative of cortical thickness). Further research is needed to better understand the effect of these tibial -fibula shape characteristics on tibial stress and injury risk. This SSM, the associated code, and three use examples for the SSM have been provided in an open-source dataset. The developed tibial surface models and statistical shape model will be made available for use at: https://simtk. org/projects/ssm_tibia.

In July 2020, we searched the websites of government institutions, carried out a systematic query of bibliographic databases for "drug utilization research" conducted in Argentina, and conducted a survey with local experts. Data collected included: the institution responsible for the database, population covered, accessibility, source of the data, healthcare setting, geographic information, and whether data were individual or aggregated. Descriptive analyses were then performed. We identified 31 data sources for DUR; only one was publicly and conveniently accessible. Five published aggregated data and provide more detailed access by formal request. Only seven sources (23%) reported national data, and most (n=29) included only data from the public healthcare sector. Although data sources for DUR have been found in Argentina, limited access by researchers and policymakers is still an significant obstacle. Increasing health data transparency by making data sources publicly available for the purpose of analyzing public health information is crucial for building a stronger health system.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							SCALING-UP; NUTRITION; EDUCATION; PROGRAMS; QUALITY; OBESITY; RATES	The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) has been shown to increase breastfeeding rates, improving maternal and child health and driving down healthcare costs via the benefits of breastfeeding. Despite its clear public health and economic benefits, one key challenge of implementing the BFHI is procuring funding to sustain the program. To address this need and help healthcare stakeholders advocate for funds, we developed a structured method to estimate the first-year cost of implementing BFHI staff training, using the United States (US) and Mexico as case studies. The method used a hospital system-wide costing approach, rather than costing an individual hospital, to estimate the average per birth BFHI staff training costs in US and Mexican hospitals with greater than 500 annual births. It was designed to utilize publicly available data. Therefore, we used the 2014 American Hospital Association dataset (n = 1401 hospitals) and the 2018 Mexican Social Security Institute dataset (n = 154 hospitals). Based on our review of the literature, we identified three key training costs and modelled scenarios via an econometric approach to assess the sensitivity of the estimates based on hospital size, level of obstetric care, and training duration and intensity. Our results indicated that BFHI staff training costs ranged from USD 7.27-125.39 per birth in the US and from PPP 2.68-6.14 per birth in Mexico, depending on hospital size and technological capacity. Estimates differed between countries because the US had more hospital staff per birth and higher staff salaries than Mexico. Future studies should examine whether similar, publicly available data exists in other countries to test if our method can be replicated or adapted for use in additional settings. Healthcare stakeholders can better advocate for the funding to implement the entire BFHI program if they are able to generate informed cost estimates for training as we did here.

Although more than 300 000 bovine-expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are available in public databases, a more thorough and directed sampling of the expressed genome is needed to identify new transcripts and improve assembly and annotation of existing transcript sequences. Accordingly, we examined the utility of constructing cDNA libraries synthesized by arbitrarily primed RT-PCR of mRNA from tissues not well represented in the publicly available bovine EST database. A total of 33 cDNA libraries were constructed from healthy and infected mammary gland tissues of Brazilian Gir and Holstein cattle. This series of libraries was used to generate 6481 open reading frame-expressed sequence tags (ORESTES) that assembled into 1798 unique sequence elements of which, 1157 did not significantly match sequence assemblies available in the Bos taurus gene index. However, a total of 264 of these 1157 sequence elements aligned with mouse and human expressed sequences demonstrating that ORESTES is an effective resource for discovery of novel expressed sequences in cattle. Furthermore, comparison of the alignment position of bovine ORESTES-derived sequence elements to human gene reference sequences suggested that the priming events for cDNA synthesis more often occurred at the central portion of a transcript, which may have contributed to the relatively high rate of novel sequence discovery.

Materials and Methods Patient-level COVID-19 records collected in a patient self-reported notification system, hospital in-patient and out-patient records, and community diagnostic labs were harmonized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model and analyzed using a federated network analytics framework. Clinical characteristics of individuals tested for, diagnosed with or tested positive for, hospitalized with, admitted to intensive care unit with, or dying with COVID-19 were estimated. Results Two COVID-19 databases covering 8.3 million people from Pakistan and 2.6 million people from Bahia, Brazil were analyzed. 109 504 (Pakistan) and 921 (Brazil) medical concepts were harmonized to Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model. In total, 341 505 (4.1%) people in the Pakistan dataset and 1 312 832 (49.2%) people in the Brazilian dataset were tested for COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 20, 2022, with a median [IQR] age of 36 [25, 76] and 38 (27, 50); 40.3% and 56.5% were female in Pakistan and Brazil, respectively. 1.2% percent individuals in the Pakistan dataset had Afghan ethnicity. In Brazil, 52.3% had mixed ethnicity. In agreement with international findings, COVID-19 outcomes were more severe in men, elderly, and those with underlying health conditions. Conclusions COVID-19 data from 2 large countries in the Global South were harmonized and analyzed using a standardized health informatics framework developed by an international community of health informaticians. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates a potential open science framework for global knowledge mobilization and clinical translation for timely response to healthcare needs in pandemics and beyond.

Its reported diagnosis sensitivity for an experienced gastroenterologist ranges from 87 to 100%.(3-5) Computational strategies, as Elastography, have been developed to support mass malignancy diagnosis. However, the studies evaluate their strategies using private datasets, making results incomparable. This work presents an annotated open-access database of Endoscopy Ultrasound videos obtained in the Gastroenterology Unit of the Hospital Universitario Nacional de Colombia and the Unidad de Gastroenterologia y Ecoendoscopia. The dataset consists of a set of 55 cases acquired in the B-mode Ultrasound image, composed of 18 cases with pancreatic cancer, 5 cases with pancreatitis, and 32 cases that include healthy pancreas, liver, and gallbladder.

Unintentional and self-poisoning mortalities in Mexico, 2000-2012	PLOS ONE			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; SUICIDE; HOSPITALIZATIONS; SEX	Introduction Poisoning remains a major worldwide public health problem. Mortality varies by country, region and ethnicity. The objective of this study is to analyze recent trends in poisoning mortality in the Mexican population. Methods Data regarding mortality induced by poisoning was obtained from a publicly available national database maintained by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. Results During the period from 2000 to 2012, average mortality rates for unintentional and self-poisoning were 1.09 and 0.41 per 100000 population, respectively. The highest mortality rate for unintentional poisoning was in older individuals of both genders while the highest mortality for self-poisoning was in older men and young women. Additional studies are needed in Mexico, especially those that analyze risk factors in older individuals and young women.

Brazilian Pharmacopoeia (BP) acts as a national standard that regulates drug quality and has six published editions. Recent genomic approaches have led to a resurgence of interest in herbal drugs. The genomic data of plants has been used for pharmaceutical applications, protecting natural resources, and efficiently regulating the market. However, there are few genomic databases specifically for medicinal plants, and the establishment of a database that focuses on the herbs contained in the BP is urgently required. Methods The medicinal plant species included in each edition of the BP were analyzed to understand the evolution of the Brazilian herbal drugs. The data of 82 plants in the BP were collected and categorized into four sections: DNA barcodes, super-barcodes, genomes, and sequencing data. A typical web server architecture pattern was used to build the database and website. Furthermore, the cp-Gs of the Aloe genus in the database were analyzed as an illustration. Results A new database, the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia Genomic Database (BPGD) was constructed and is now publicly accessible. A BLAST server for species identification and sequence searching with the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), the intergenic region (psbA-trnH), and the chloroplast genome (cp-G) of Brazilian medicinal plants was also embedded in the BPGD. The database has 753 ITS2 of 76 species, 553 psbA-trnH and 190 genomes (whole genome and chloroplast genome) of 57 species. In addition, it contains 37 genome sequence data sets of 24 species and 616 transcriptome sequence data sets of 34 species and also includes 187 cp-Gs representing 57 medicinal species in the BP. Analyses of the six cp-Gs of three Aloe species identified the variable regions in the cp-Gs. These can be used to identify species and understand the intraspecific relationships. Conclusions This study presents the first genomic database of medicinal plants listed in the latest BP. It serves as an efficient platform to obtain and analyze genomic data, accelerate studies regarding Brazilian medicinal plants and facilitate the rational development on their market regulation.

This dataset was acquired from 2004 to 2008 as a subset of a larger stratified random sample of 2,019 participants from La Lisa municipality in La Habana, Cuba. The exclusion criteria included the presence of disease or brain dysfunctions. Participant data that is being shared comprises i) high-density (64-120 channels) resting-state electroencephalograms (EEG), ii) magnetic resonance images (MRI), iii) psychological tests (MMSE, WAIS-III, computerized go-no go reaction time), as well as iv,) demographic information (age, gender, education, ethnicity, handedness, and weight). The EEG data contains recordings with at least 30minutes in duration including the following conditions: eyes closed, eyes open, hyperventilation, and subsequent recovery.

From a public health perspective, food security is an essential social determinant for promoting healthy nutrition. Food security embraces four dimensions: physical availability of food, economic and physical access to food, food utilization, and the sustainability of the dimensions above. Integrally addressing the four dimensions is vital. Surprisingly most of the works focused on a single dimension of food security: the physical availability of food. ObjectiveThe paper proposes a multi-dimensional dataset of open data and satellite images to characterize food security in the department of Cauca, Colombia. MethodsThe food security dataset integrates multiple open data sources; therefore, the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining methodology was used to guide the construction of the dataset. It includes sources such as population and agricultural census, nutrition surveys, and satellite images. ResultsAn open multidimensional dataset for the Department of Cauca with 926 attributes and 9 rows (each row representing a Municipality) from multiple sources in Colombia, is configured. Then, machine learning models were used to characterize food security and nutrition in the Cauca Department. As a result, The Food security index calculated for Cauca using a linear regression model (Mean Absolute Error of 0.391) is 57.444 in a range between 0 and 100, with 100 the best score. Also, an approach for extracting four features (Agriculture, Habitation, Road, Water) of satellite images were tested with the ResNet50 model trained from scratch, having the best performance with a macro-accuracy, macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-F1-score of 91.7, 86.2, 66.91, and 74.92%, respectively. ConclusionIt shows how the CRISP-DM methodology can be used to create an open public health data repository. Furthermore, this methodology could be generalized to other types of problems requiring the creation of a dataset. In addition, the use of satellite images presents an alternative for places where data collection is challenging. The model and methodology proposed based on open data become a low-cost and effective solution that could be used by decision-makers, especially in developing countries, to support food security planning.

Brazil was implicated as central in the ZIKV dispersion, however, a better understanding of the pathways the virus took to arrive in Brazil and the dispersion within the country is needed. An updated genome dataset was assembled with publicly available data. Bayesian phylogeography methods were applied to reconstruct the spatiotemporal history of ZIKV in the Americas and with more detail inside Brazil. Our analyses reconstructed the Brazilian state of Pernambuco as the likely point of introduction of ZIKV in Brazil, possibly during the 2013 Confederations Cup. Pernambuco played an important role in spreading the virus to other Brazilian states. Our results also underscore the long cryptic circulation of ZIKV in all analyzed locations in Brazil. Conclusions: This study brings new insights about the early moments of ZIKV in the Americas, especially regarding the Brazil-Haiti cluster at the base of the American clade and describing for the first time migration patterns within Brazil.

Free asthma medications reduces hospital admissions in Brazil (Free asthma drugs reduces hospitalizations in Brazil)	RESPIRATORY MEDICINE			English	Article						Asthma; Hospital admission; Medication; Steroids	MANAGEMENT	Background: Since June 2011, the Brazilian health system started providing asthma medications (beclomethasone and salbutamol), totally free of charge to patients with asthma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the provision of free asthma medications on hospital admissions for asthma in Brazil, using a national hospitalization database (DATASUS), comparing the incidence of hospital admissions before and after the free supply of these drugs. Methods: Admissions of patients with 1-49 years of age by the Brazilian public health system with the diagnosis of asthma were compared pre (2008-2010) and post (2012-2014) provision of free medicines (beclomethasone and salbutamol). The number of hospital admissions due to asthma and non-respiratory diseases, as well as the amount spent with asthma hospitalization, were obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian government open-access public health database system. Results: Admission rates for asthma significantly decreased from 90.09/100.000 (2008-2010) to 59.85/100.000 (2012-2014), when the period pre and post provision of free medicines were compared [OR 0.67 (CI 0.48-0.92)]. Non-respiratory admission rates remained stable, when both periods were also compared. Conclusion: Asthma hospitalization rates significantly decreased in the three-year period after the provision of free medicines to treat asthma. Our findings suggest that the provision of free medications for asthma may have a particular public health impact by its own in developing countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objective: To study the eco-epidemiology of alphaviruses in bats of departments of Cordoba and Sucre, Colombia. Methodology: A prospective descriptive cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sampling, in 12 localities of Cordoba and Sucre was carried out. Using mist nets capture of the specimens was carried out. The size of the sample was 286 bats, each specimen captured was taxonomically classified. The bats were immobilized with anesthetic and analgesic treatment according to the ethics committee of the University of Cordoba, morphometric measurements and blood samples were taken, later they were necropsied in the field to obtain a collection of tissues which were preserved in liquid N-2 - 190 degrees C. The averages of the climatic conditions of the sampling sites were extracted from the WorldClim database (http://www.worldclim.org/). The open source software QGIS (Quantum GIS Development Team.2015) was used to map and visualize bioclimatic regions of Cordoba. We used descriptive and retrospective information about the equine population and reports of foci of equine encephalitis. Results: In Cordoba and Sucre, 286 bats were captured and 23 species were classified, Artibeus and Phyllostomus discolor were the most frequent captured genus. The geographic ranges of the captured species were variable, some had a wide distribution and others were restricted to some areas. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus RNA was detected in Artibeus planirostris and Sturnira lilium (2/286 = 0.70%) from Cordoba Colombia. The univariate descriptive analysis showed no significant association for any of the analyzed variables climatic. Conclusions: Frugivorous bats from the Caribbean area of Colombia may be involved in the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus enzootic cycle.

Pre-epidemic evolution of the MRSA USA300 clade and a molecular key for classification	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						USA300; SNPs; phylogenetic; epidemics; molecular key	RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; EMERGENCE; CLONE; SEQUENCE; PROTEIN	IntroductionUSA300 has remained the dominant community and healthcare associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clone in the United States and in northern South America for at least the past 20 years. In this time, it has experienced epidemic spread in both of these locations. However, its pre-epidemic evolutionary history and origins are incompletely understood. Large sequencing databases, such as NCBI, PATRIC, and Staphopia, contain clues to the early evolution of USA300 in the form of sequenced genomes of USA300 isolates that are representative of lineages that diverged prior to the establishment of the South American epidemic (SAE) clade and North American epidemic (NAE) clade. In addition, historical isolates collected prior to the emergence of epidemics can help reconstruct early events in the history of this lineage. MethodsHere, we take advantage of the accrued, publicly available data, as well as two newly sequenced pre-epidemic historical isolates from 1996, and a very early diverging ACME-negative NAE genome, to understand the pre-epidemic evolution of USA300. We use database mining techniques to emphasize genomes similar to pre-epidemic isolates, with the goal of reconstructing the early molecular evolution of the USA300 lineage. ResultsPhylogenetic analysis with these genomes confirms that the NAE and SAE USA300 lineages diverged from a most recent common ancestor around 1970 with high confidence, and it also pinpoints the independent acquisition events of the of the ACME and COMER loci with greater precision than in previous studies. We provide evidence for a North American origin of the USA300 lineage and identify multiple introductions of USA300 into South and North America. Notably, we describe a third major USA300 clade (the pre-epidemic branching clade; PEB1) consisting of both MSSA and MRSA isolates circulating around the world that diverged from the USA300 lineage prior to the establishment of the South and North American epidemics. We present a detailed analysis of specific sequence characteristics of each of the major clades, and present diagnostic positions that can be used to classify new genomes.

Nevertheless, it may not be straightforward to conduct all required assessments physically in a clinic. Previous efforts in providing such a classification leveraged Machine Learning (ML)-based techniques on centralised data collected from activities of daily living (ADL); however, they used black-box optimisation methods and classification approaches that are not generalisable, hindering their application and impact in a clinical setting from an applied intelligence perspective. Thus, this study developed, applied, and validated a novel two-step neuroevolutionary optimisation approach to achieve earlier convergence in a user-centred and explainable manner, by applying early stopping based on three cross-entropy loss functions (for training, validation, and test) and optimise hyperparameters concurrently to ensure generalisation of the predictive performance by design. This method was applied to a neural network-based decision support system for aiding detection of motor impairments using three publicly available datasets on 190 children with motor impairments, including 483 socio-demographic and clinical self-care-related features in total. Such biomarkers were based on "The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health for Children and Youth" (ICF-CY) and retrieved from the University California Irvine ML database, which were leveraged for the initial model training, validation, and testing. Moreover, to increase users' confidence and drive adoption of the proposed applied intelligence-based tool, two additional publicly available datasets were used for validating the proposed two-step neuroevolutionary approach; such data include 34 and 39 socio-demographic and self-care-related clinical characteristics features as indicators of the functional independence of 50 further children with motor disability from a hospital in the city of Salvador, State of Bahia in Brazil. A novel, explainable and generalisable two-step neuroevolutionary approach guided early stopping based on three cross-entropy loss functions and optimised hyperparameters concurrently to improve generalisation in a neural network-based classifier. The ability of the proposed hybrid decision support system to detect motor impairments in the paediatric subjects considered was evaluated as compared to the best-performing ML-based classification systems on the same benchmark datasets to date. Whilst leveraging a transparent optimisation approach, results demonstrate its superior generalisation, quantified via the classification accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, being almost 6% higher than the most accurate and reliable ML-based system on the same benchmark dataset from published studies, thus supporting its potential for aiding classification of self-care problems in children with physical and motor disability in a clinical setting.

Childhood immunization rates in rural Intibuca, Honduras: an analysis of a local database tool and community health center records for assessing and improving vaccine coverage	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Vaccines; Childhood immunization; Honduras; Database; Community health workers; Public health		Background: Vaccines are highly effective at preventing infectious diseases in children, and prevention is especially important in resource-limited countries where treatment is difficult to access. In Honduras, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports very high immunization rates in children. To determine whether or not these estimates accurately depict the immunization coverage in non-urban regions of the country, we compared the WHO data to immunization rates obtained from a local database tool and community health center records in rural Intibuca, Honduras. Methods: We used data from two sources to comprehensively evaluate immunization rates in the area: 1) census data from a local database and 2) immunization data collected at health centers. We compared these rates using logistic regression, and we compared them to publicly available WHO-reported estimates using confidence interval inclusion. Results: We found that mean immunization rates for each vaccine were high (range 84.4 to 98.8 percent), but rates recorded at the health centers were significantly higher than those reported from the census data (p <= 0.001). Combining the results from both databases, the mean rates of four out of five vaccines were less than WHO-reported rates (p<0.05). Overall immunization rates were significantly different between townships (p= 0.03). The rates by individual vaccine were similar across townships (p> 0.05), except for diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine (p=0.02) and oral polio vaccine (p<0.01). Conclusions: Immunization rates in Honduras were high across data sources, though most of the rates recorded in rural Honduras were less than WHO-reported rates. Despite geographical difficulties and barriers to access, the local database and Honduran community health workers have developed a thorough system for ensuring that children receive their immunizations on time. The successful integration of community health workers and a database within the Honduran decentralized health system may serve as a model for other immunization programs in resource-limited countries where health care is less accessible.

PH education addresses essential questions of how humanity inhabits Earth, and how humans affect, and are affected by, natural systems. A pilot massive open online course (MOOC) in PH was created in Brazil in 2020. This MOOC capitalized on the global online pivot, to make the course accessible to a broader audience. This study describes the process of course creation and development and assesses the impact evaluation data and student outcomes of the PH MOOC.Methods: The PH MOOC pilot was launched in Brazilian Portuguese, using the TelessaudeRS-UFRGS platform on 4/27/2020 and concluded on 7/19/2020 with a total load of 80 h. It was composed of 8 content modules, pre and post-test, 10 topics in a forum discussion, and an optional action plan. This study analyzes the course database, profile of participants, answers to questionnaires, forum interaction, and action plans submitted.Results: Two thousand seven hundred seventy-seven participants enrolled in the course, of which 1,237 (44.54%) gave informed consent for this study. Of the 1,237 participants who agreed to participate in the research, 614 (49.8%) completed the course, and 569 (92.67%) were accredited by TelessaudeRS-UFRGS. The majority of the participants were concerned with climate change, trained in the health area, and worked in primary health care in places that lacked ongoing sustainability programs. Two hundred forty-one action plans were submitted, major topics identified were food and nutrition, infectious diseases, and garbage and recycling.Discussion: The use of the PH lens and open perspective of the course centered the need to communicate planetary health topics to individuals. The local plans reflected the motto of "think global and act local." Brazil presents a context of an unprecedented social, political, and environmental crisis, with massive deforestation, extensive fires, and biomass burning altering the biomes, on top of an ongoing necropolitical infodemic and COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of these multiple challenges, this MOOC offers a timely resource for health professionals and communities, encouraging them to address planetary challenges as fundamental health determinants.

The demand for dialysis, hemodialysis, and other costly treatments is also rising. In most cases, the problem is detected at an advanced stage; therefore, it is essential to create a model that could warn the medical doctor about the possibility of disease or see early signs of renal disease. This work presents the first experiences of analyzing, developing, and comparing three machine learning algorithm prototype models that could early alert the medical doctor of possible chronic kidney disease using an open-access dataset in the patient being the Naive Bayes model the more accurate. Collecting a Panamanian chronic kidney disease dataset and training the models with national patient data is strongly suggested.

ReRep: Computational detection of repetitive sequences in genome survey sequences (GSS)	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							LEISHMANIA-BRAZILIENSIS; TELOMERIC REPEATS; OPEN SOFTWARE; ELEMENTS; DATABASE; DISEASE	Background: Genome survey sequences (GSS) offer a preliminary global view of a genome since, unlike ESTs, they cover coding as well as non-coding DNA and include repetitive regions of the genome. A more precise estimation of the nature, quantity and variability of repetitive sequences very early in a genome sequencing project is of considerable importance, as such data strongly influence the estimation of genome coverage, library quality and progress in scaffold construction. Also, the elimination of repetitive sequences from the initial assembly process is important to avoid errors and unnecessary complexity. Repetitive sequences are also of interest in a variety of other studies, for instance as molecular markers. Results: We designed and implemented a straightforward pipeline called ReRep, which combines bioinformatics tools for identifying repetitive structures in a GSS dataset. In a case study, we first applied the pipeline to a set of 970 GSSs, sequenced in our laboratory from the human pathogen Leishmania braziliensis, the causative agent of leishmaniosis, an important public health problem in Brazil. We also verified the applicability of ReRep to new sequencing technologies using a set of 454-reads of an Escheria coli. The behaviour of several parameters in the algorithm is evaluated and suggestions are made for tuning of the analysis. Conclusion: The ReRep approach for identification of repetitive elements in GSS datasets proved to be straightforward and efficient. Several potential repetitive sequences were found in a L. braziliensis GSS dataset generated in our laboratory, and further validated by the analysis of a more complete genomic dataset from the EMBL and Sanger Centre databases. ReRep also identified most of the E. coli K12 repeats prior to assembly in an example dataset obtained by automated sequencing using 454 technology. The parameters controlling the algorithm behaved consistently and may be tuned to the properties of the dataset, in particular to the length of sequencing reads and the genome coverage.

A behavioral and brain imaging dataset with focus on emotion regulation of women with fibromyalgia	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							PAIN; ALEXITHYMIA; PREVALENCE; ACTIVATION; CRITERIA; BURDEN; SCALES; IMPACT	Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain, as well as numerous symptoms related to central sensitization such as: fatigue, cognitive disturbances, constipation/diarrhea and sensory hypersensitivity. Furthermore, depression and anxiety are prevalent comorbidities, accompanied by emotion processing and regulation difficulties. Although fibromyalgia physiopathology is still not fully understood, neuroimaging research methods have shown brain structural and functional alterations as well as neuroinflammation abnormalities. We believe that open access to data may help fibromyalgia research advance more. Here, we present an open dataset of 33 fibromyalgia female patients and 33 paired healthy controls recruited from a Mexican population. Dataset includes demographic, clinical, behavioural and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The MRI data consists of: structural (T1- and T2- weighted) and functional (task-based and resting state) sequences. The task was an emotion processing and regulation task based on visual stimuli. The MRI data contained in the repository are unprocessed, presented in Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format and available on the OpenNeuro platform for future analysis.

Surgical Non-governmental Organizations: Global Surgery's Unknown Nonprofit Sector	WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article							WORKFORCE	Charitable organizations may play a significant role in the delivery of surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, in order to quantify their collective contribution, to account for the care they provide in national surgical plans, and to maximize coordination between organizations, a comprehensive database of these groups is required. We aimed to create such a database using web-available data. We searched for organizations that meet the United Nations Rule of Law definition of non-governmental organizations and provide surgery in LMICs. We termed these surgical non-governmental organizations (s-NGOs). We screened multiple sources including a listing of disaster relief organizations, medical volunteerism databases, charity commissions, and the results of a literature search. We performed a secondary review of each eligible organization's website to verify inclusion criteria and extracted data. We found 403 s-NGOs providing surgery in all 139 LMICs, with most (61 %) incorporating surgery into a broader spectrum of health services. Over 80 % of s-NGOs had an office in the USA, the UK, Canada, India, or Australia, and they most commonly provided surgery in India (87 s-NGOs), Haiti (71), Kenya (60), and Ethiopia (55). The most common specialties provided were general surgery (184), obstetrics and gynecology (140), and plastic surgery (116). This new catalog includes the largest number of s-NGOs to date, but this is likely to be incomplete. This list will be made publicly available to promote collaboration between s-NGOs, national health systems, and global health policymakers.

Epidemiology of hydrocephalus in Brazil	JORNAL DE PEDIATRIA			English	Article						Epidemiology; Hydrocephalus; National registry	ENDOSCOPIC 3RD VENTRICULOSTOMY; CONGENITAL HYDROCEPHALUS; PRENATAL-DIAGNOSIS; PREGNANCY; DELIVERY	Objective: Describe the epidemiological profile and social-economic burden that hydrocephalus patients represent to the national public health system, using data available at the online data-base of the Brazilian Health Ministry (DataSUS).Methods: This is a populational study based on descriptive statistics of all clinical and surgical appointments included in the DataSUS database. Data included herein were collected between 2015 and 2021 and subdivided into three main groups, related to hydrocephalus incidence and mortality, hospitalizations, and financial costs.Results: In the study period, 3993 new cases of congenital hydrocephalus were diagnosed, with 6051 deaths overall. The mortality rate in the country was 1.5/100000 live births and the preva-lence was 0.374/100000 inhabitants. The number of hospitalizations resulting from treatment procedures and complications of hydrocephalus was 137,880 and there was a reduction of up to 27.2% during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics concerning previous years. Total costs for hydrocephalus management in the country amounted to 140,610,585.51 dollars. Conclusions: Hydrocephalus has a significant impact on public health budgets and pediatric mortal-ity rates; however, it is probably underestimated, due to the paucity of demographic data and epi-demiological studies in Latin America and, specifically, in Brazil. The dataSUS also has several limitations in accessing certain data related to hydrocephalus, making it difficult to have a more assertive understanding of the disease in Brazil. The results of this study provide important guidance for future research projects in clinical and experimental hydrocephalus and also the creation of public policies for better governance and care of hydrocephalus patients.(c) 2022 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

Identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients using machine learning	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE	The current COVID-19 public health crisis, caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has produced a devastating toll both in terms of human life loss and economic disruption. In this paper we present a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying whether a given patient (actually infected or suspected to be infected) is more likely to survive than to die, or vice-versa. We train this algorithm with historical data, including medical history, demographic data, as well as COVID-19-related information. This is extracted from a database of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infections in Mexico, constituting the official COVID-19 data compiled and made publicly available by the Mexican Federal Government. We demonstrate that the proposed method can detect high-risk patients with high accuracy, in each of four identified clinical stages, thus improving hospital capacity planning and timely treatment. Furthermore, we show that our method can be extended to provide optimal estimators for hypothesis-testing techniques commonly-used in biological and medical statistics. We believe that our work could be of use in the context of the current pandemic in assisting medical professionals with real-time assessments so as to determine health care priorities.

Glocal Clinical Registries: Pacemaker Registry Design and Implementation for Global and Local Integration - Methodology and Case Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ASSOCIATION TASK-FORCE; KEY DATA ELEMENTS; CARDIAC-RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY; STANDARDS WRITING COMMITTEE; ELECTRONIC DATA CAPTURE; DEVELOP DATA STANDARDS; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; DEFINITIONS; HEALTH; DEFIBRILLATOR	Background: The ability to apply standard and interoperable solutions for implementing and managing medical registries as well as aggregate, reproduce, and access data sets from legacy formats and platforms to advanced standard formats and operating systems are crucial for both clinical healthcare and biomedical research settings. Purpose: Our study describes a reproducible, highly scalable, standard framework for a device registry implementation addressing both local data quality components and global linking problems. Methods and Results: We developed a device registry framework involving the following steps: (1) Data standards definition and representation of the research workflow, (2) Development of electronic case report forms using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), (3) Data collection according to the clinical research workflow and, (4) Data augmentation by enriching the registry database with local electronic health records, governmental database and linked open data collections, (5) Data quality control and (6) Data dissemination through the registry Web site. Our registry adopted all applicable standardized data elements proposed by American College Cardiology/American Heart Association Clinical Data Standards, as well as variables derived from cardiac devices randomized trials and Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium. Local interoperability was performed between REDCap and data derived from Electronic Health Record system. The original data set was also augmented by incorporating the reimbursed values paid by the Brazilian government during a hospitalization for pacemaker implantation. By linking our registry to the open data collection repository Linked Clinical Trials (LinkedCT) we found 130 clinical trials which are potentially correlated with our pacemaker registry. Conclusion: This study demonstrates how standard and reproducible solutions can be applied in the implementation of medical registries to constitute a re-usable framework. Such approach has the potential to facilitate data integration between healthcare and research settings, also being a useful framework to be used in other biomedical registries.

We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes during the first year of HAART between HIV-1-infected patients in low-income and high-income settings. Methods 18 HAART programmes in Africa, Asia, and South America (low-income settings) and 12 HIV cohort studies from Europe and North America (high-income settings) provided data for 4810 and 22 217, respectively, treatment-naive adult patients starting HAART. All patients from high-income settings and 2725 (57%) patients from low-income settings were actively followed-up and included in survival analyses. Findings Compared with high-income countries, patients starting HAART in low-income settings had lower CD4 cell counts (median 108 cells per mu L vs 234 cells per mu L), were more likely to be female (51% vs 25%), and more likely to start treatment with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (70% vs 23%). At 6 months, the median number of CD4 cells gained (106 cells per mu L vs 103 cells per mu L) and the percentage of patients reaching HIV-1 RNA levels lower than 500 copies/mL (76% vs 77%) were similar. Mortality was higher in low-income settings (124 deaths during 2236 person-years of follow-up) than in high-income settings (414 deaths during 20 532 person-years). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of mortality comparing tow-income with high-income settings fell from 4.3 (95% CI 1.6-11.8) during the first month to 1.5 (0.7-3.0) during months 7-12. The provision of treatment free of charge in low-income settings was associated with lower mortality (adjusted HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.08-0.61). Interpretation Patients starting HAART in resource-poor settings have increased mortality rates in the first months on therapy, compared with those in developed countries. Timely diagnosis and assessment of treatment eligibility, coupled with free provision of HAART, might reduce this excess mortality.

This movement should enable greater participation by society in the development of a more efficient State, with the provision of public utility services, making wide use of technologies. To make this understanding clearer, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried out, which sought to reveal strategies for the use of open data, tools and techniques of Information Visualization. In Brazil, the municipalities are inspected by the State Audit Courts, and the Sao Paulo State Court of Auditors provides an open database of more than 600 municipalities. From this open database, complemented by other data sources and performance indicators, based on SLR results, the work presented in this article shows that with the correct application of Information Visualization techniques, it facilitates the understanding of public management. The public service is an important source of data, as it contains information that can have a direct impact on each citizen's life and compromise essential services such as health, safety and education. What is intended again is to structure specialized presentations according to the user's profile. The proposal is presented in the form of specific dashboards according to the user's profile, which proved to be essential to add value to the information and improve the understanding of the interested parties.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) from 2008 to 2020 in the SUS and to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the number of procedures and death rate of CABG performed in 2020 through the database DATASUS. Methods This study is based on publicly available material obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian Ministry of Health's data processing system, on numbers of surgical procedures and death rates. Only isolated CABG procedures were included in our study. We used the TabNet software from the DATASUS website to generate reports. Results We identified 281,760 CABG procedures performed from January 2008 to December 2020. The average number of procedures until the end of 2019 was of 22,104. During 2020 there was a 25% reduction CABG procedures, to 16,501. There was an increase in the national death rate caused by a statistical significant increase in death rates in Brazil's Southeast and Central-west regions. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global challenge for Brazil's health care system. During the year of 2020 there was a reduction in access to CABG related to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. There was also an increase in the national CABG death rate.

J	Madero-Cabib, I; Dintrans, PV; Salas, JB				Madero-Cabib, Ignacio; Villalobos Dintrans, Pablo; Browne Salas, Jorge			Extending the Analysis of Functional Ability Trajectories to Unexplored National Contexts: The Case of Chile	JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Chile; Disability; Functional ability; Life course; Trajectory	OLDER-ADULTS; DISABILITY TRAJECTORIES; LIFE; LIMITATIONS; HISTORY; MEXICO; AGE	Objectives Despite the enormous advances in the field, most evidence about functional ability trajectories in old age comes from studies conducted in developed and high-income countries. This research aims to build on these previous advances to examine functional ability trajectories in Chile. Method Drawing on a robust, publicly available 15-year panel data set (2004-2018), and using sequence analysis, we examine functional ability trajectories types among 4 age groups (people aged 46-50, 51-55, 56-60, and 61-64 at baseline). Then, we analyze trajectories' dynamics looking at intraindividual health-declining and health-recovery transitions between functional ability statuses, within each trajectory type. Finally, we assess how multiple baseline individual characteristics predict the likelihood of following a functional ability trajectory type, using multinomial regression models. Results Across all age groups, an important fraction (between 26% and 50%) reports stable healthy trajectories, and between 10% and 20% follow equivocal-declining trajectories (i.e., exhibiting both health-declining and health-recovery intraindividual transitions), suggesting that age might not be the main source of heterogeneity in functional ability trajectories. Overall, women, lower educated people, nonworking individuals, and people with a higher burden of chronic conditions at baseline are more prevalent among health-declining trajectory types; however, these results are not constant across the age groups analyzed. Discussion This nationally focused study reinforces the feasibility and usefulness of an in-depth analysis of functional ability trajectories in old age.

In this work, we present the objective hypernasality measure (OHM), a speech-based algorithm that automatically measures hypernasality in speech, and validate it relative to a group of trained clinicians. Methods: We trained a deep neural network (DNN) on approximately 100 hours of a publicly-available healthy speech corpus to detect the presence of nasal acoustic cues generated through the production of nasal consonants and nasalized phonemes in speech. Importantly, this model does not require any clinical data for training. The posterior probabilities of the deep learning model were aggregated at the sentence and speaker-levels to compute the OHM. Results: The results showed that the OHM was significantly correlated with perceptual hypernasality ratings from the Americleft database (r = 0.797, p < 0.001) and the New Mexico Cleft Palate Center (NMCPC) database (r = 0.713, p < 0.001). In addition, we evaluated the relationship between the OHM and articulation errors; the sensitivity of the OHM in detecting the presence of very mild hypernasality; and established the internal reliability of the metric. Further, the performance of the OHM was compared with a DNN regression algorithm directly trained on the hypernasal speech samples. Significance: The results indicate that the OHM is able to measure the severity of hypernasality on par with Americleft-trained clinicians on thisdataset.

We aimed to identify, catalogue, and characterize Brazilian data sources for Drug Utilization Research (DUR).Methods: The present study is part of the project entitled, "Publicly Available Data Sources for Drug Utilization Research in Latin American (LatAm) Countries." A network of Brazilian health experts was assembled to map secondary administrative data from healthcare organizations that might provide information related to medication use. A multi-phase approach including internet search of institutional government websites, traditional bibliographic databases, and experts' input was used for mapping the data sources. The reviewers searched, screened and selected the data sources independently; disagreements were resolved by consensus. Data sources were grouped into the following categories: 1) automated databases; 2) Electronic Medical Records (EMR); 3) national surveys or datasets; 4) adverse event reporting systems; and 5) others. Each data source was characterized by accessibility, geographic granularity, setting, type of data (aggregate or individual-level), and years of coverage. We also searched for publications related to each data source.Results: A total of 62 data sources were identified and screened; 38 met the eligibility criteria for inclusion and were fully characterized. We grouped 23 (60%) as automated databases, four (11%) as adverse event reporting systems, four (11%) as EMRs, three (8%) as national surveys or datasets, and four (11%) as other types. Eighteen (47%) were classified as publicly and conveniently accessible online; providing information at national level. Most of them offered more than 5 years of comprehensive data coverage, and presented data at both the individual and aggregated levels. No information about population coverage was found. Drug coding is not uniform; each data source has its own coding system, depending on the purpose of the data. At least one scientific publication was found for each publicly available data source.Conclusions: There are several types of data sources for DUR in Brazil, but a uniform system for drug classification and data quality evaluation does not exist. The extent of population covered by year is unknown. Our comprehensive and structured inventory reveals a need for full characterization of these data sources.

Inotersen, an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of hepatic TTR production, demonstrated a favorable efficacy and safety profile in patients with the polyneuropathy associated with hATTR in the NEURO-TTR (NCT01737398) study. We report longer-term efficacy and safety data for inotersen, with a median treatment exposure of 3 years. Methods Patients who satisfactorily completed NEURO-TTR were enrolled in its open-label extension (OLE) study. Efficacy assessments included the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 (mNIS + 7), Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) questionnaire total score, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36v2) Health Survey Physical Component Summary score. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Efficacy is reported for patients living in Europe and North America (this cohort completed the study approximately 9 months before the remaining group of patients outside these regions); safety is reported for the full safety dataset, comprising patients living in Europe, North America, and Latin America/Australasia. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02175004. Results In the Europe and North America cohort of the NEURO-TTR study, 113/141 patients (80.1%) completed the study, and 109 patients participated in the OLE study. A total of 70 patients continued to receive inotersen (inotersen-inotersen) and 39 switched from placebo to inotersen (placebo-inotersen). The placebo-inotersen group demonstrated sustained improvement in neurological disease progression as measured by mNIS + 7, compared with predicted worsening based on projection of the NEURO-TTR placebo data (estimated natural history). The inotersen-inotersen group demonstrated sustained benefit, as measured by mNIS + 7, Norfolk QoL-DN, and SF-36v2, compared with estimated natural history as well as compared with the placebo-inotersen group. With a maximum exposure of 6.2 years, inotersen was not associated with any additional safety concerns or increased toxicity in the OLE study. Platelet and renal monitoring were effective in reducing the risk of severe adverse events in the OLE study. Conclusion Inotersen treatment for > 3 years slowed progression of the polyneuropathy associated with hATTR, and no new safety signals were observed.

J	Barboza, G; Appel, JG				Barboza, Gia; Appel, Joan Goldsworthy			Child maltreatment data in the state of New Mexico across space and time	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Child abuse and neglect; Child maltreatment; New Mexico; Public health; Social determinants of health; Housing and food insecurity; Bayesian spatiotemporal model		Child maltreatment is a serious public health problem. Previous research demonstrates that child maltreatment clusters in low-income, racially homogenous neighborhoods. Little is known, however, about the structural correlates of spatial risk in small areas such as census tracts. Here we present additional information regarding the data and methods used in the recent article published in Child Abuse & Neglect entitled "Variability and stability in child maltreatment risk across time and space and its association with neighborhood social & housing vulnerability in New Mexico: A Bayesian space-time model" [1] . The present dataset merges child maltreatment data from the New Mexico Department of Public Health with multiple sources of publicly available data to create a novel public health analysis. Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling techniques were used to map the relative risk of substantiated child maltreatment across census tracts in the state, and to elucidate spatial and temporal heterogeneity in risk. The data was initially collected by the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department, the state organization that suspected child abuse and neglect cases are reported to and the organization that then substantiates these cases. The data were then sent to the New Mexico Community Data Collaborative, a data analytic organization under the umbrella of the New Mexico Department of Health. The point file consisting of home addresses of sub stantiated cases of child abuse was then aggregated by census tract, mapped for the entire state of New Mexico and made available to the public for research and analysis by different public health organizations and researchers (including the present researchers). The very purpose of making the data available to the public was to allow deeper investigations into trends and associations with other social determinants of health. This analysis demonstrates the public health importance of data sharing and accessibility. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

Forecasting the dynamics of cumulative COVID-19 cases (confirmed, recovered and deaths) for top-16 countries using statistical machine learning models: Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						COVID-19; Statistical modeling; Pandemic; ARIMA SARIMA; Time-series forecast; Auto-Correlation Function (ACF); Akaike Information Criteria (AIC); Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)	SPREAD	Most countries are reopening or considering lifting the stringent prevention policies such as lockdowns, consequently, daily coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases (confirmed, recovered and deaths) are increasing significantly. As of July 25th, there are 16.5 million global cumulative confirmed cases, 9.4 million cumulative recovered cases and 0.65 million deaths. There is a tremendous necessity of supervising and estimating future COVID-19 cases to control the spread and help countries prepare their healthcare systems. In this study, time-series models - Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) are used to forecast the epidemiological trends of the COVID-19 pandemic for top-16 countries where 70%-80% of global cumulative cases are located. Initial combinations of the model parameters were selected using the auto-ARIMA model followed by finding the optimized model parameters based on the best fit between the predictions and test data. Analytical tools Auto-Correlation function (ACF), Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used to assess the reliability of the models. Evaluation metrics Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) were used as criteria for selecting the best model. A case study was presented where the statistical methodology was discussed in detail for model selection and the procedure for forecasting the COVID-19 cases of the USA. Best model parameters of ARIMA and SARIMA for each country are selected manually and the optimized parameters are then used to forecast the COVID-19 cases. Forecasted trends for confirmed and recovered cases showed an exponential rise for countries such as the United States, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Bangladesh, India, Mexico and Pakistan. Similarly, trends for cumulative deaths showed an exponential rise for countries Brazil, South Africa, Chile, Colombia, Bangladesh, India, Mexico, Iran, Peru, and Russia. SARIMA model predictions are more realistic than that of the ARIMA model predictions confirming the existence of seasonality in COVID-19 data. The results of this study not only shed light on the future trends of the COVID-19 outbreak in top-16 countries but also guide these countries to prepare their health care policies for the ongoing pandemic. The data used in this work is obtained from publicly available John Hopkins University's COVID-19 database. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[ArunKumar, K.

The Mexican magnetic resonance imaging dataset of patients with cocaine use disorder: SUDMEX CONN	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BARRATT IMPULSIVENESS SCALE; SIGNAL-TO-NOISE; EMOTION REGULATION; REVISED VERSION; VALIDATION; SEGMENTATION; DIFFICULTIES; INSTRUMENT; HANDEDNESS	Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a substance use disorder (SUD) characterized by compulsion to seek, use and abuse of cocaine, with severe health and economic consequences for the patients, their families and society. Due to the lack of successful treatments and high relapse rate, more research is needed to understand this and other SUD. Here, we present the SUDMEX CONN dataset, a Mexican open dataset of 74 CUD patients (9 female) and matched 64 healthy controls (6 female) that includes demographic, cognitive, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. MRI data includes: 1) structural (T1-weighted), 2) multishell high-angular resolution diffusion-weighted (DWI-HARDI) and 3) functional (resting state fMRI) sequences. The repository contains unprocessed MRI data available in brain imaging data structure (BIDS) format with corresponding metadata available at the OpenNeuro data sharing platform. Researchers can pursue brain variability between these groups or use a single group for a larger population sample.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, they were required to adapt to changes in their clinical practices. The goal of the present study was to describe AHNP perceptions concerning the impact of the pandemic on their roles, practice, and resource allocation.Methods: An online survey was distributed globally via email by the International Pediatric Transplant Association to AHNP at transplant centers from September to December 2020. Responses to open-ended questions were collected using an electronic database. Using a thematic analysis approach, coding was conducted by three independent coders who identified patterns in responses, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion.Results: The majority of respondents (n = 119) were from North America (78%), with many other countries represented (e.g., the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Central and South America). Four main categories of impacts were identified: (1) workflow changes, (2) the quality of the work environment, (3) patient care, and (4) resources.Conclusions: Participants indicated that the pandemic heightened existing barriers and resource challenges frequently experienced by AHNP; however, the value of team connections and opportunities afforded by technology were also highlighted. Virtual care was seen as increasing healthcare access but concerns about the quality and consistency of care were also expressed. A notable gap in participant responses was identified; the vast majority did not identify any personal challenges connected with the pandemic (e.g., caring for children while working remotely, personal stress) which likely further impacted their experiences.

An approach to identify a minimum and rational proportion of caesarean sections in resource-poor settings: a global network study	LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; NEONATAL-MORTALITY; INCOME COUNTRIES; OBSTETRIC CARE; DELIVERY; RATES; DETERMINANTS; STILLBIRTH; BIRTH	Background Caesarean section prevalence is increasing in Asia and Latin America while remaining low in most African regions. Caesarean section delivery is effective for saving maternal and infant lives when they are provided for medically-indicated reasons. On the basis of ecological studies, caesarean delivery prevalence between 9% and 19% has been associated with better maternal and perinatal outcomes, such as reduced maternal land fetal mortality. However, the specific prevalence of obstetric and medical complications that require caesarean section have not been established, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We sought to provide information to inform the approach to the provision of caesarean section in low-resource settings. Methods We did a literature review to establish the prevalence of obstetric and medical conditions for six potentially life-saving indications for which caesarean section could reduce mortality in LMICs. We then analysed a large, prospective population-based dataset from six LMICs (Argentina, Guatemala, Kenya, India, Pakistan, and Zambia) to determine the prevalence of caesarean section by indication for each site. We considered that an acceptable number of events would be between the 25th and 75th percentile of those found in the literature. Findings Between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2013, we enrolled a total of 271 855 deliveries in six LMICs (seven research sites). Caesarean section prevalence ranged from 35% (3467 of 9813 deliveries in Argentina) to 1% (303 of 16 764 deliveries in Zambia). Argentina's and Guatemala's sites all met the minimum 25th percentile for five of six indications, whereas sites in Zambia and Kenya did not reach the minimum prevalence for caesarean section for any of the indications. Across all sites, a minimum overall caesarean section of 9% was needed to meet the prevalence of the six indications in the population studied. Interpretation In the site with high caesarean section prevalence, more than half of the procedures were not done for life-saving conditions, whereas the sites with low proportions of caesarean section (below 9%) had an insufficient number of caesarean procedures to cover those life-threatening causes. Attempts to establish a minimum caesarean prevalence should go together with focusing on the life-threatening causes for the mother and child. Simple methods should be developed to allow timely detection of life-threatening conditions, to explore actions that can remedy those conditions, and the timely transfer of women with those conditions to health centres that could provide adequate care for those conditions.

MethodsWe surveyed individual dispensed prescriptions of opioids in private pharmacies from October 2012 to September 2013. A descriptive analysis of costs included a calculation of the overall and mean maximum price to consumers. Monetary costs were converted from local currency units (Brazilian Real - BRL) to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchanging rates. Results129,708 prescriptions were retrieved from the database. The overall expenditure on opioids was R$4,316,383.46 BRL or $2,721,315.82 (PPP). The mean cost of an individual prescription was R$33.27 BRL ($20.98 PPP), ranging from 14.19 to 3,255.60 BRL. Codeine was frequently prescribed (87.2 percent). ConclusionsThe expenditure on opioids is a significant cost to Brazilian patients, especially given that the Brazilian Public Health System should dispense these drugs free of charge. Codeine was the most prescribed opioid.

Disparity in biomedical publication trends in the CARICOM countries: Is there a need for a more vibrant research culture in the region?	SAGE OPEN MEDICINE			English	Article						Biomedical publications; research productivity; disparity; PubMed; SCImago Journal & Country Rank; CARICOM countries	GOOGLE-SCHOLAR; LATIN-AMERICA; OPEN ACCESS; SCIENCE; WEB; SCOPUS	Background: Biomedical research and publications provide evidence-based information about the extent and burden of health-related problems of a country and help to formulate strategic and operational plans to tackle the problems. Purpose: To determine the biomedical publication rates of CARICOM full member countries. Methods: Biomedical publications of full member CARICOM countries were retrieved using PubMed (1990-2015) and SCImago Journal & Country Rank (1996-2015) databases. CARICOM countries having >50 publications in the PubMed (1990-2015) database were subject to further analysis, whereby publications of each country were adjusted by total population (million population), gross domestic product (billion-dollar), and Internet usage rate (hundred thousand population). Results: Total publications by all countries were 7281 and 8378 in PubMed and SCImago Journal & Country Rank, respectively. Jamaica produced highest number of publications (PubMed: 3928 (53.9%); SCImago Journal & Country Rank: 2850 (34.0%)). In both databases, Grenada had the highest research publications when adjusted with per million population (4721 and 10,633), per billion gross domestic product (803 and 1651), and per hundred thousand Internet users (1487 and 3387). Trend analysis revealed Jamaica produced the highest number of additional PubMed listed publications each year, averaging 4.8/year, followed by Trinidad and Tobago (4.4). According to SCImago Journal & Country Rank, Jamaica also had the highest number of citations (42,311) and h-index (76), followed by Trinidad and Tobago (29,152 and 71). Barbados had the highest number of citations per document (24.9), followed by Haiti (18.4). The publication rates determined by PubMed and SCImago Journal & Country Rank databases were significantly correlated (p < 0.001). Most publications (68% SCImago Journal & Country Rank and 85% PubMed) can be attributed to authors affiliated with Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad. Conclusion: Publication and citation rates varied markedly between CARICOM countries and were in general low. Most publications could be attributed to researchers affiliated with The University of the West Indies. More universities valuing biomedical research are needed in the region, and more resources needed to improve publication rates.

A search for programs was conducted using the University Information System database and universities' websites, as well as using the Ministry of Health's database on health personnel and data on the number of enrolled and current students provided by the University Information System database and the Transparency section of the universities.ResultsThere were 214 undergraduate, 55 specialty and 7 subspecialty programmes, of which 39%, 47% and 100%, respectively, were offered in the capital city. The duration ranged from 5 to 7 years for undergraduate programs and from 1 to 3 years for subspecialty and second specialty programs. The cost of undergraduate programs ranged from free of charge up to USD 6863.75 for the first semester of study. Second specialty programs ranged from 720 up to 11 986 USD and subspecialty programs ranged from 2267 up to 9138 USD, with medicine being the most expensive. On the other hand, there are a greater number of psychology students (n = 78 781) pursuing undergraduate studies than working professionals (n = 5368), while in the second specialty of psychiatry there are far fewer students pursuing the specialty (n = 67) than working professionals (n = 454).ConclusionsThe problem of professional training in mental health requires that the institutions involved in health and education develop policies to decentralize programs, communicate the demand for professionals in certain areas, make them accessible to the low-income population, respond to mental health problems and guarantee their quality. On the other hand, regarding the low number of mental health personnel working, it is suggested to increase the mental health budget to generate more mental health services and employment.

J	Jamal, S; Scaria, V				Jamal, Salma; Scaria, Vinod			Cheminformatic models based on machine learning for pyruvate kinase inhibitors of Leishmania mexicana	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							EPIDEMIOLOGY; DISEASES	Background: Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which affects approx. 12 million individuals worldwide and caused by parasite Leishmania. The current drugs used in the treatment of Leishmaniasis are highly toxic and has seen widespread emergence of drug resistant strains which necessitates the need for the development of new therapeutic options. The high throughput screen data available has made it possible to generate computational predictive models which have the ability to assess the active scaffolds in a chemical library followed by its ADME/toxicity properties in the biological trials. Results: In the present study, we have used publicly available, high-throughput screen datasets of chemical moieties which have been adjudged to target the pyruvate kinase enzyme of L. mexicana (LmPK). The machine learning approach was used to create computational models capable of predicting the biological activity of novel antileishmanial compounds. Further, we evaluated the molecules using the substructure based approach to identify the common substructures contributing to their activity. Conclusion: We generated computational models based on machine learning methods and evaluated the performance of these models based on various statistical figures of merit. Random forest based approach was determined to be the most sensitive, better accuracy as well as ROC. We further added a substructure based approach to analyze the molecules to identify potentially enriched substructures in the active dataset. We believe that the models developed in the present study would lead to reduction in cost and length of clinical studies and hence newer drugs would appear faster in the market providing better healthcare options to the patients.

The many operational Earth Observation platforms provide options for the generation of land cover maps, each with unique characteristics and considerable semantic differences in the definition of classes. As a result, differences in baseline estimates are inevitable. Here we compare forest cover and surface water estimates over four time periods spanning three decades (1989-2018) for similar to 1.3 million km(2) encompassing the Xingu River Basin, Brazil, from published, freely accessible remotely sensed land cover classifications. While all showed a decrease in forest extent over time, the total deforested area reported by each ranged widely for all time periods. The greatest differences ranged from 9% to 17% (116,958 to 219,778 km(2)) deforestation of the total area for year 2000 and 2014-2018 time period, respectively. We also show the high sensitivity of forest fragmentation metrics (entropy and foreground area density) to data quality and spatial resolution, with cloud cover and sensor artefacts resulting in errors. Surface water classifications must be chosen carefully because sources differ greatly in location and mapped area of surface water. After operationalization of the Belo Monte dam complex, the large reservoirs are notably absent from several of the classifications illustrating land cover. Freshwater ecosystem health is influenced by the land cover surrounding water bodies (e.g., riparian zones). Understanding differences between the many remotely sensed baselines is fundamentally important to avoid information misuse, and to objectively choose the most appropriate classification for ecological studies, conservation, or policy making. The differences between the classifications examined here are not a failure of the technology, but due to different interpretations of 'forest cover' and characteristics of the input data (e.g., spatial resolution). Our findings demonstrate the importance of transparency in the generation of remotely sensed classifications and the need for users to familiarize themselves with the characteristics and limitations of each data set.

Genome-wide diversity of Zika virus: Exploring spatio-temporal dynamics to guide a new nomenclature proposal	VIRUS EVOLUTION			English	Article						Zika virus; arbovirus; phylogeography; molecular epidemiology; evolutionary biology	MOSAIC STRUCTURE; DNA-SEQUENCES; RECOMBINATION; EVOLUTION; ENHANCEMENT; POPULATIONS; EMERGENCE; SELECTION; CRITERIA; EPIDEMIC	The Zika virus (ZIKV) disease caused a public health emergency of international concern that started in February 2016. The overall number of ZIKV-related cases increased until November 2016, after which it declined sharply. While the evaluation of the potential risk and impact of future arbovirus epidemics remains challenging, intensified surveillance efforts along with a scale-up of ZIKV whole-genome sequencing provide an opportunity to understand the patterns of genetic diversity, evolution, and spread of ZIKV. However, a classification system that reflects the true extent of ZIKV genetic variation is lacking. Our objective was to characterize ZIKV genetic diversity and phylodynamics, identify genomic footprints of differentiation patterns, and propose a dynamic classification system that reflects its divergence levels. We analysed a curated dataset of 762 publicly available sequences spanning the full-length coding region of ZIKV from across its geographical span and collected between 1947 and 2021. The definition of genetic groups was based on comprehensive evolutionary dynamics analyses, which included recombination and phylogenetic analyses, within- and between-group pairwise genetic distances comparison, detection of selective pressure, and clustering analyses. Evidence for potential recombination events was detected in a few sequences. However, we argue that these events are likely due to sequencing errors as proposed in previous studies. There was evidence of strong purifying selection, widespread across the genome, as also detected for other arboviruses. A total of 50 sites showed evidence of positive selection, and for a few of these sites, there was amino acid (AA) differentiation between genetic clusters. Two main genetic clusters were defined, ZA and ZB, which correspond to the already characterized 'African' and 'Asian' genotypes, respectively. Within ZB, two subgroups, ZB.1 and ZB.2, represent the Asiatic and the American (and Oceania) lineages, respectively. ZB.1 is further subdivided into ZB.1.0 (a basal Malaysia sequence sampled in the 1960s and a recent Indian sequence), ZB.1.1 (South-Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, and Micronesia sequences), and ZB.1.2 (very similar sequences from the outbreak in Singapore). ZB.2 is subdivided into ZB.2.0 (basal American sequences and the sequences from French Polynesia, the putative origin of South America introduction), ZB.2.1 (Central America), and ZB.2.2 (Caribbean and North America). This classification system does not use geographical references and is flexible to accommodate potential future lineages. It will be a helpful tool for studies that involve analyses of ZIKV genomic variation and its association with pathogenicity and serve as a starting point for the public health surveillance and response to on-going and future epidemics and to outbreaks that lead to the emergence of new variants.

Within this context, soil microbiological properties such as microorganism abundance, total microbial biomass, and enzymatic activities have been used as soil quality indicators. However, these properties are very sensitive to changes triggered by agronomic management. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of agricultural practices in the vineyards from the Central Monte Desert, San Juan, Argentina including the effects on soil microbial biomass using soils from the open shrubland as a reference. The microbial biomass carbon was significantly greater in soils from the open shrubland than in the vineyards during April and November. The abundance of cultivable soil microorganisms (bacteria and filamentous fungi) in soil samples from vineyards and open shrubland was statistically similar. Vineyard soils showed increased enzymatic activities (both in rows and between rows) in both seasons. We used multivariate analysis of all data measured here to propose a data set of variables (amylase, cellulase, and xylanase activities, bacterial abundance, microbial biomass and water content, pH and electric conductivity) for use in future studies of soil quality in the Central Monte Desert.

J	Krauskopf, E				Krauskopf, Erwin			A bibiliometric analysis of the Journal of Infection and Public Health: 2008-2016	JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Bibliometric; Citation analysis; Collaboration network; Journal evaluation	SELF-CITATION	Background: The Journal of Infection and Public Health published its first issue in 2008. The fact that the journal has been published uninterruptedly as well as its editorial content and the application of a peer-review process to select manuscripts, made the journal eligible to be indexed by databases such as Scopus. This study presents a general overview of the journal from 2008 until 2016 using bibliometric indicators to assess its performance. Methods: The data for this study, dating between 2008 and 2016, was extracted from Scopus database. All the information was exported in CSV format to the Sequel Pro software for data analysis. Additionally, collaboration and word co-occurrence networks were generated using VOSviewer. Results: The total number of documents published between 2008-2016 was 586, of which local authorship (Saudi Arabia) constituted a small share, accounting only for 19.3% (113 documents). Those with foreign authorship (other countries excluding Saudi Arabia) represented 80.7% (473) of the total. Furthermore, the three countries that co-author documents with researchers from Saudi Arabia are Egypt, the United States and the United Kingdom. Likewise, these three countries serve as nodes connecting researchers from other countries located in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. An analysis of the top-five journals that cited the research published revealed that that 90.2% of them belonged to the first and second quartiles confirms the quality of the research being published. Word co-occurrence analysis established a slight shift of focus in the research topics published during the last four years studied, as a new cluster was formed with terms related to "education", "intervention" and "implementation". Conclusion: The journal has managed, in very few years, to be considered by researchers worldwide. Furthermore, throughout the years, the journal showed an evolution in the main topics covered, providing a contemporary overview of public health.

Understanding the most recent global patterns and temporal trends of cervical cancer burden might be helpful for its prevention and control. Methods Data on cervical cancer (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code C53) incidence and mortality in 2018 were extracted from the GLOBOCAN 2018 database and further analyzed for their correlations with the Human Development Index. Temporal trends were analyzed using the annual percent change with joinpoint analysis among 31 countries with highly qualified data from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Plus and World Health Organization mortality databases. Future trends for the next 15 years were predicted using an open-source age-period-cohort model. Results Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates were both negatively correlated with the Human Development Index (r = -0.56 for incidence, r = -0.69 for mortality; P < .001) in cross-sectional analysis, and both remained stable in 12 countries or even decreased in 14 and 18 countries for incidence and mortality, respectively, during the most recent 10 data years. Similar findings were observed for the next 15 years. Conclusions Cervical cancer burden was correlated with socioeconomic development. An overwhelming majority of countries had stable or decreasing trends in incidence and mortality rates, especially in those with effective cervical cancer screening programs and human papillomavirus vaccination. Lay Summary The authors investigated the most up-to-date data from official databases released by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and found that cervical cancer incidence and mortality were negatively correlated with socioeconomic development. Among the 31 countries analyzed, most (26 countries were analyzed for incidence, and 30 were analyzed for mortality) had stable or even decreasing temporal trends over the most recent 10 years, especially in those with effective cervical cancer screening programs. In addition, the predicted trends for the next 15 years were basically consistent with the observed trends among most of the analyzed countries (19 countries for incidence and 26 countries for mortality).

In 2016 Ecuador experienced a 7.8Mw earthquake and, more recently, the Covid-19 confinement. Both events may have negatively affected the mental health of the Ecuadorian population. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the suicide rates and choice of suicide method in the Ecuadorian population between January 2011 and December 2020. The dataset used is publicly available on the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Censuses. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) for potential sociodemographic factors associated with each suicide method compared to other reported suicide methods. There were 10,380 registered cases of suicide in Ecuador between 2011 and 2020. Significant suicide rates per provinces were seen in Napo with 12.63 and Azuay with 12.52, followed by Bolivar with 12.30, and Orellana with 11.36 suicides/100,000 habitants. Hanging accounted for 7082 cases (68.2 %). The mestizos (82 %) were the most prevalent ethnicity of all suicide cases. School-age children with 6-12 years (OR 8.83, 95 % CI 5.34-14.59) and adolescents with 13-19 years (OR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.29-1.66) were more likely to use hanging as method of suicide. In conclusion, we observed an increase of suicide rates from 8.15 per 100,000 in 2011 to 8.81 in 2020. The confinement of COVID-19 pandemic in the period evaluated did not significantly affect the suicide rates. An increased suicide rate was observed in the province hardest hit by the 2016 earthquake.

Real-world evidence of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with cabazitaxel: comparison with the randomized clinical study CARD	PROSTATE CANCER AND PROSTATIC DISEASES			English	Article							OPEN-LABEL; DOCETAXEL; ENZALUTAMIDE; ABIRATERONE; MITOXANTRONE; PREDNISONE; MEN	Background The CARD study demonstrated superiority of cabazitaxel over abiraterone/enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who received prior docetaxel and progressed <= 12 months on the alternative androgen-receptor-targeted agent (ARTA). The objective was to compare characteristics and treatment patterns of patients from a real-world dataset with the CARD population. Methods Real-world data were collected from Medimix Live Tracker(TM), a retrospective, global oncology database of healthcare professional-reported electronic patient medical forms (2001-2019), with data from patients from Europe, USA, Brazil and Japan. The database contained patient, tumor and treatment information for 12,140 patients who received >= 1 line of treatment for mCRPC. A CARD-like cohort included patients treated with docetaxel, prior abiraterone/enzalutamide and cabazitaxel. Results A large proportion of patients received >= 2 lines of ARTA (35.1%) with 42% of patients who received a first-line ARTA receiving another ARTA in second line. Of the total patients, 452 were eligible for the CARD-like cohort. Median age of the CARD-like cohort was comparable to CARD (73 vs 70 years). The CARD-like cohort had unfavorable disease characteristics vs CARD: ECOG PS >= 2 (45% vs 4.7%); metastasis at diagnosis (46% vs 38%) and Gleason 8-10 (65% vs 57%). More patients in the CARD-like cohort received ARTA before docetaxel (48% vs 39%) and received the first ARTA for >12 months (30% vs 17%) compared with CARD. Despite more patients in the CARD-like cohort receiving the lower 20 mg/m(2) dose of cabazitaxel (55% vs 21%), cabazitaxel treatment duration was similar (21.9 vs 22.0 weeks). Conclusions Sequential use of ARTA was frequent. Results indicate the CARD population is reflective of routine clinical practice and duration of response to cabazitaxel was similar in a real-world population.

Using an online platform to obtain data, a survey was developed and distributed through electronic means during a 6-week period covering July and August 2020, considered one of the periods with the highest reported COVID cases in Mexico. Our survey looked at six major stress developing areas: danger, fear of contamination, social economic consequences, xenophobia, compulsive checking and reassurance seeking, and traumatic stress; we added an extra question to assess fear of being an asymptomatic patient. The data was statistically analyzed looking for correlations and dependencies. Thus, helping in policy and decision-making processes to assist and manage stress in healthcare professionals.

A database was developed with infant deaths from 2000 to 2004 analyzed by the Committees for the Prevention of Infant Mortality, based on integration of the Information System on Live Births (SINASC), Mortality Information System, and Investigation of Infant Mortality in the State of Parana. The data mining software was WEKA (open source). The data mining conducts a database search and provides rules to be analyzed to transform the data into useful information. After mining, 4,230 rules were selected: teenage pregnancy plus birth weight < 2,500g, or post-term birth plus teenage mother with a previous child or intercurrent conditions increase the risk of neonatal death. The results highlight the need for greater attention to teenage mothers, newborns with birth weight < 2,500g, post-term neonates, and infants of mothers with intercurrent conditions, thus corroborating other studies.

A unique data set of adolescents (n = 779, mean age = 14, 51 % male) provided home addresses of study participants which were geocoded and mapped. Satellite maps of neighborhoods were used to identify open spaces for recreational use (e.g., soccer fields and plazas). Thiessen polygons were generated to associate study participants with the nearest available open space using ArcGIS. Regression models, with smoking as a dependent variable, were estimated in which age, sex, family socioeconomic status, peer substance usage, neighborhood crime, and accessibility of open space were covariates. The results show that residential proximity to recreational space was significantly and inversely associated with tobacco consumption among female, but not male, adolescents. Age and neighborhood crime were both positively associated with tobacco consumption among both male and female adolescents. This study suggests that recreational spaces in proximity to residences may have a positive impact on reducing adolescents' inclination to consume tobacco. The relationship of the accessibility to such spaces with smoking appears to vary by adolescents' sex.

J	de Castro, GZ; Guerra, RR; Guimaraes, FG				de Castro, Giulia Zanon; Guerra, Rubia Reis; Guimaraes, Frederico Gadelha			Automatic translation of sign language with multi-stream 3D CNN and generation of artificial depth maps	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Sign language recognition; Gesture recognition; Deep learning; 3D convolutional neural networks; Computer vision; Generative adversarial networks		Sign languages play an essential role in the cognitive and social development of the deaf, consisting of a natural form of communication and being a symbol of identity and culture. However, hearing loss has a severe social impact due to an existing communication barrier, preventing access to essential services such as education and health. A bi-directional sign language translation may be the solution to bridging the communication gap between the deaf and the listener, completing a two-way communication cycle. Virtual personal assistants can benefit from this technology by extending how users interact with the intelligent system. With this idea, in this work we develop a multi-stream deep learning model to recognize signs of Brazilian (BSL), Indian (ISL), and Korean (KSL) Sign Languages. We combine different types of information for the classification task, using single-stream and multi-stream 3D Convolutional Neural Networks. In addition, considering the largest source of sign data globally - the internet - we propose a depth sensor-free classification method, with depth maps artificially generated through Generative Adversarial Networks. In order to consider the main parameters that encode sign languages, the final architecture is composed of a multi-stream network that receives the segmented hands, the faces, the distances and speeds of the points of articulation, and the RGB frames associated with artificial depth maps. Finally, we provide a visual explanation to understand which regions were important for model decision-making. The best models were obtained using the multi-stream network, presenting an accuracy of 0.91 +/- 0.07, and f1-score of 0.90 +/- 0.08 on publicly available BSL data set. The results suggest that the multi-stream network with artificially generated depth maps is suitable for the task of sign recognition in different languages.

Two environmental factors associated with NTDs are Folate and One Carbon Metabolism (FOCM) and Glucose Homeostasis and Oxidative Stress (GHOS). Utilizing next-generation sequencing of a large patient cohort, we identify novel candidate genes in these two networks to provide insights into NTD mechanisms. Methods: Exome sequencing (ES) was performed in 511 patients, born with myelomeningocele, divided between European American and Mexican American ethnicities. Healthy control data from the Genome Aggregation database were ethnically matched and used as controls. Rare, high fidelity, nonsynonymous predicted damaging missense, nonsense, or canonical splice site variants in independently generated candidate gene lists for FOCM and GHOS were identified. We used a gene-based collapsing approach to quantify mutational burden in case and controls, with the control cohort estimated using cumulative allele frequencies assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Results: We identified 45 of 837 genes in the FOCM network and 22 of 568 genes in the GHOS network as possible NTD risk genes withp < 0.05. No nominally significant risk genes were shared between ethnicities. Using a novel approach to mutational burden we identify 55 novel NTD risk associations. Conclusions: We provide a means of utilizing large publicly available sequencing datasets as controls for sequencing projects examining rare disease. This approach confirmed existing risk genes for myelomeningocele and identified possible novel risk genes. Lastly, it suggests possible distinct genetic etiologies for this malformation between different ethnicities.

L.			LeishDB: a database of coding gene annotation and non-coding RNAs in Leishmania braziliensis	DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ANALYSIS; SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNAS; REPERTOIRE; TRANSCRIPTION; ALIGNMENT	Leishmania braziliensis is the etiological agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disease with high public health importance, affecting 12 million people worldwide. Although its genome sequence was originally published in 2007, the two reference public annotations still presents at least 80% of the genes simply classified as hypothetical or putative proteins. Furthermore, it is notable the absence of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences from Leishmania species in public databases. These poorly annotated coding genes and ncRNAs could be important players for the understanding of this protozoan biology, the mechanisms behind host-parasite interactions and disease control. Herein, we performed a new prediction and annotation of L. braziliensis protein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs, using recently developed predictive algorithms and updated databases. In summary, we identified 11 491 ORFs, with 5263 (45.80%) of them associated with proteins available in public databases. Moreover, we identified for the first time the repertoire of 11 243 ncRNAs belonging to different classes distributed along the genome. The accuracy of our predictions was verified by transcriptional evidence using RNA-seq, confirming that they are actually generating real transcripts. These data were organized in a public repository named LeishDB (www.leishdb.com), which represents an improvement on the publicly available data related to genomic annotation for L. braziliensis. This updated information can be useful for future genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics studies; being an additional tool for genome annotation pipelines and novel studies associated with the understanding of this protozoan genome complexity, organization, biology, and development of innovative methodologies for disease control and diagnostics.

We explored the associations of sociodemographic, health-related indicators, and health behavioral factors on dietary guideline compliance in elderly Chileans. We used a cross-sectional design using the publicly available database from the last Chilean National Health Survey (2016-17). The sample of 1831 older adults (>= 60 y) from a national representative sample. The dependent variable was compliance with Food Guidelines (FG) (daily consumption of water, dairy, and fruits and vegetables; and weekly consumption of legumes and fish). The independent variables included sociodemographic, health-related, and behavioral factors. Over half (51.8%) of the sample was female and 85.7% belonged to the 60-79 age group. Satisfactory compliance to FG was observed in 3.9% of the sample. In the adjusted analysis, for those between 60 and 79 y, marital status was the only significant variable associated with FG noncompliance (PR: 1.34; 95%CI: 1.04-1.71). For those over 80 y, income of >2 minimum wages (PR: 0.10; 95%CI: 0.02-0.61), living alone (PR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.20-2.47), and self-reported cardiovascular disease (PR: 0.63; 95%CI: 0.43-0.93) were associated with FG noncompliance. We observed low FG compliance among elderly Chilean adults, especially in the oldest group. Factors associated with the FG compliance was different between age groups.

J	Queiroz, HAD; Goncalves, RM; Mishra, M				de Araujo Queiroz, Heithor Alexandre; Goncalves, Rodrigo Mikosz; Mishra, Manoranjan			Characterizing global satellite-based indicators for coastal vulnerability to erosion management as exemplified by a regional level analysis from Northeast Brazil	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Coastal vulnerability to erosion; Global indicator; Remotely sensed data set; PCA; Coastal vulnerability index	RISK-ASSESSMENT; SANDY BEACHES; SEA-LEVEL; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; VEGETATION COVER; SOIL-EROSION; INPUT DATA; NDVI; MODEL; INDEX	The detection of coastal vulnerability to erosion is crucial for decision-making regarding the economy, ecology, health, security, among other issues. Most of the studies gather a large data set about physical and anthropogenic interfer-ence's on the vulnerability of coastal erosion regions around the world. However, for developing nations like Brazil, with extensive shoreline, it is challenging to develop and maintain an in situ infrastructure to offer a systematical scientific data set. In this context, several methods like Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) for monitoring the dynamic behavior of coastal systems require in situ collected data. Therefore, this contribution explores the use of global open source satellite-based indicators to assess coastal vulnerability to erosion at a regional level adopting an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, the data set covers many spheres of the environ-ment like biophysical and social factors, adopting the Pernambuco State's coast, Brazil, as a case study. The results showed the direct relationship between a high level of urbanization and low vegetation with the high coastal vulnera-bility to erosion. PC1 revealed built-up and surface temperature vary inversely to the soil organic carbon and vegetation cover along about 20 km (approximate to 10% of the shoreline extension). The hotspots were in the urban cluster (Paulista, Olinda, Recife, and Jaboatao dos Guararapes), combined with high shoreline change around -2 m/yr. PC2 showed the natural action of wind on wave heights combined with sediment removal and the backshore settlement along 10 km of extension (approximate to 5.5% of the shoreline), with the highly vulnerable sites concentrated in Itamaraca Island and C. S. Agostinho. This approach benefits from the multi-satellite and multi-resolution data sets integration to unravel the statistical influence of each variable able to guide stakeholders.

Methods: Ecological and retrospective study using data from the informatics department of the Brazilian Public Health System database. Procedure codes were "open prostatectomy" and "transurethral resection of the prostate." The outcomes analyzed were compared between transurethral resection of the prostate and open prostatectomy according to the hospital surgical volume and presence or absence of a residency program. Results: A total of 18,874 surgeries were analyzed (77% transurethral resection of the prostate) and overall mortality was not statistically different between procedures. Intermediate and high-volume centers had shorter length of hospital stay than low-volume centers for transurethral resection of the prostate (3.28, 3.02, and 6.58 days, respectively, p=0.01 and p=0.004). Length of hospital stay was also shorter for open prostatectomy in high-volume compared to low-volume centers (4.86 versus 10.76 days, p=0.036). Intrahospital mortality was inversely associated with surgical volume for transurethral resection of the prostate. Centers with residency program had shorter length of hospital stay considering open prostatectomy and less mortality regarding transurethral resection of the prostate. Open prostatectomy was 64% more expensive than transurethral resection of the prostate.

The latter application includes for paternity testing and DNA profiling of samples collected from scenes of crime and suspects. This survey provides the first dataset for 21 STR loci across the Akan population in Ghana by genotyping of 109 unrelated healthy individuals using Investigator 24plex kit. None of the STR loci screened deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after applying Bonferroni correction. Overall, 224 unique alleles were observed with allele frequencies ranging from 0.005 to 0.518. The combined match probability, combined power of exclusion and combined power discrimination were 1 in 4.07 x 10(-25), 0.999999999 and 1, respectively. Principal co-ordinate analysis carried out using 21 STR allele frequency data mapped the Akans with Nigerian subpopulation groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba), but separated from Thais of Thailand, Chechen of Jordan and Tijuana of Mexico.

Mauricio; Figueroa, Daniela; Osorno-Covarrubias, Javier; Jimenez, Aldo Daniel			The link between agriculture and rural food security in the ecoregions of Mexico: path diagrams and underlying dataset	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Food system; Path diagram; Path relationships; Agricultural system; Smallholder agriculture; Food security; Mexico; Emerging economies		In this research, we build two food systems datasets in Mexico; The first one describes the structure of agricultural production units and the second one describes food security aspects of the rural population in these agricultural production units. We also build a third dataset, consisting of path diagrams and path coefficients (derived from Structural Equation Modeling) that relate the first dataset to the second dataset in the four most populated ecoregions of Mexico. The description of the path models and the insights they bring to the current state of food security in Mexican rural households are detailed in an associated article entitled "Is food security primarily associated with smallholder agriculture or with commercial agriculture?: An approach to the case of Mexico using structural equation modeling" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103091). The agricultural variables (in the first dataset) include farm size, destination of the farmer's production, cultivation practice / water management, predominant source of income of the household, land tenure type, crop diversity, agricultural surface expansion, and the presence of forest cover. They are based on the primary data of the full, latest available agricultural census in Mexico and corresponding official land use / land cover data. The second dataset consists of four food security indicators designed and built for the first food security model in Mexico that incorporates food availability, food accessibility and food utilization aspects. They include the Food Self-sufficiency Index (the balance between food production and food consumption), the Food Access Index (inversely related to marginalization), the Entitlement to Public Health Care index, and the Undernutrition Infrequency index (related to hospital sickness records). We provide the path tables and diagrams that describe the links between the agricultural structure and food security. These diagrams provide the first nationwide statistical evidence for the prominent role of smallholder agriculture in rural food security at the national level and at ecoregion scale for a country of the global South. In order to further investigate the structure of the agricultural production units and their relationships with socioeconomic, territorial and landscape data, artificial intelligence (i.e. data mining and machine learning) techniques could be performed on this compendium of datasets. The food security data may stir the development of more food security models in Mexico in relation to other drivers such as consumption habits and non-agricultural activities of rural households.

Although Pseudomonas species are recognized as important spoilage organisms in foodstuff, they are also known as opportunistic pathogens associated with hospital-acquired infections. Furthermore, Pseudomonas can play a role as potential reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance genes, which may be horizontally transferred to other bacteria. Considering that cephalosporins (3rd and higher generations) and carbapenems are critically important beta-lactam antimicrobials in human medicine, this study reports the occurrence and genomic characterization of a meropenem-nonsusceptible Pseudomonas otitidis strain recovered from a chicken carcass in Brazil. Materials, Methods & Results: During the years 2018-2019, 72 frozen chicken carcasses were purchased on the retail market from different regions in Brazil. Aliquots from individual carcass rinses were screened for Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria in MacConkey agar supplemented with 1mg.L-1 cefotaxime. Phenotypically resistant isolates were further tested for resistance to other antimicrobials and confirmed as ESBL-producers by means of disk-diffusion method using Muller-Hinton agar. Only one meropenen-nonsusceptible isolate was detected and submitted to whole genome sequencing (WGS) in Illumina Miseq. The strain was identified as Pseudomonas otitidis by local alignment of the 16S rRNA sequence using BLASTn and confirmed by Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) analysis using JspeciesWS database. Genes encoding for antimicrobial resistance were detected by means of Resfinder and Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) databases. The phenotypic non-susceptibility to meropenen was attributed to the gene bla POM-1. A total of 192 different genes encoding for quorum sensing system, antiphagocytosis, iron uptake, efflux pump, endotoxin and toxin, adherence, and secretion systems were detected by means of Virulence Factor Database (VFDB). Pseudomonas otitidis-pan genome was built using Roary-rapid large-scale prokaryote pan genome analysis using the present strain (K_25) and other two P. otitidis genomes (PAM-1, DSM 17224) publicly available at the NCBI. The core genome analysis of the two human strains resulted in similar percentages. Discussion: Carbapenems are critically important drugs for human health and bacterial strains resistant to these antimicrobials pose a public health problem. The bla POM-1 gene harbored by the Pseudomonas otitidis K_25 strain encodes a metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) conferring resistance to carbapenems. Pseudomonas otitidis was the first confirmed pathogenic Pseudomonas species expressing MBL constitutively in the absence of inducible beta-lactamase genes. Furthermore, the several virulence genes associated with the capacity of the P. otitidis K_25 to colonize, evade the immune system and cause lesions in the human host confirm this strain as a potential opportunistic pathogen contaminating foodstuff. These reinforce the need to address antimicrobial resistance in a One Health perspective, in which resistant bacteria and resistance determinants circulate among environment, animals and humans.

J	Badri, A; Nadeau, S; Gbodossou, A				Badri, Adel; Nadeau, Sylvie; Gbodossou, Andre			Integration of OHS into Risk Management in an Open-Pit Mining Project in Quebec (Canada)	MINERALS			English	Article						occupational health and safety (OHS); risk management; industrial projects; action research; analytical hierarchy process (AHP); open-pit mine	SAFETY CULTURE; INDUSTRY; HEALTH; TECHNOLOGIES; ACCIDENTS; CLIMATE	Despite undeniable progress, the mining industry remains the scene of serious accidents revealing disregard for occupational health and safety (OHS) and leaving open the debate regarding the safety of its employees. The San Jose mine last collapse near Copiapo, Chile on 5 August 2010 and the 69-day rescue operation that followed in order to save 33 miners trapped underground show the serious consequences of neglecting worker health and safety. The aim of this study was to validate a new approach to integrating OHS into risk management in the context of a new open-pit mining project in Quebec, based on analysis of incident and accident reports, semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and collaborative field observations. We propose a new concept, called hazard concentration, based on the number of hazards and their influence. This concept represents the weighted fraction of each category of hazards related to an undesirable event. The weight of each category of hazards is calculated by AHP, a multicriteria method. The proposed approach included the creation of an OHS database for facilitating expert risk management. Reinforcing effects between hazard categories were identified and all potential risks were prioritized. The results provided the company with a rational basis for choosing a suitable accident prevention strategy for its operational activities.

The system was based on open-source software. The database has records for about 3200 patients from 30 Brazilian hospitals. An evaluation by doctors from the six hospitals comprising the Neuroblastoma Cooperative Group was positive, mainly because the system allows easy online access, but also because the electronic register performs data validation when information is inserted. Our experience shows that it is possible to use a Web-based system to provide paediatric cancer services at a distance.

Feasibility of describing community strengths relative to Omaha system concepts	PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING			English	Article						community assessment; community strengths; international cooperation; Omaha system; qualitative research; standardized terminology		ObjectivesThe purpose was to determine the feasibility of using a standardized language, the Omaha System, to describe community-level strengths. The objectives were: (a) to evaluate the feasibility of using the Omaha System at the community level to reflect community strengths and (b) to describe preliminary results of community strengths observations across international settings. Design and SampleA descriptive qualitative design was used. The sample was a data set of 284 windshield surveys by nursing students in 5 countries: Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Turkey, and the United States. MeasuresAn online survey included a checklist and open-ended questions on community strengths for 11 concepts of the Omaha System Problem Classification Scheme: Income, Sanitation, Residence, Neighborhood/workplace safety, Communication with community resources, Social contact, Interpersonal relationship, Spirituality, Nutrition, Substance use, and Health care supervision. Themes were derived through content analysis of responses to the open-ended questions. ResultsFeasibility was demonstrated: Students were able to use the Omaha System terms and collect data on strengths. Common themes were described among the five countries. ConclusionsThe Omaha System appears to be useful in documenting community-level strengths. Themes and exemplar quotes provide a first step in developing operational definitions of strengths at a more granular level.

Uses of tuberculosis mortality surveillance to identify programme errors and improve database reporting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE			English	Article						tuberculosis; death certificate; surveillance; hospital mortality; programme evaluation	RIO-DE-JANEIRO; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; HEALTH; DEATHS; CARE; PREVALENCE; IMPACT	BACKGROUND: In 2006, 848 persons died from tuberculosis (TB) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, corresponding to a mortality rate of 5.4 per 100 000 population. No specific TB death surveillance actions are currently in place in Brazil. SETTING: Two public general hospitals with large open emergency rooms in Rio de Janeiro City. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of TB death surveillance in detecting gaps in TB control. METHODS: We conducted a survey of TB deaths from September 2005 to August 2006. Records of TB-related deaths and deaths due to undefined causes were investigated. Complementary data were gathered from the mortality and TB notification databases. RESULTS: Seventy-three TB-related deaths were investigated. Transmission hazards were identified among fire-fighters, health care workers and in-patients. Management errors included failure to isolate suspected cases, to confirm TB, to correct drug doses in underweight patients and to trace contacts. Following the survey, 36 cases that had not previously been notified were included in the national TB notification database and the outcome of 29 notified cases was corrected. CONCLUSION: TB mortality surveillance can contribute to TB monitoring and evaluation by detecting correctable and specific programme- and hospital-based care errors, and by improving the accuracy of TB database reporting. Specific local and programmatic interventions can be proposed as a result.

J	Angelo, ED; Oliveira, M				Angelo, Edna da Silva; Oliveira, Marlene			ALTMETRIC STUDY OF THE SOCIAL REPERCUSSION OF OPEN ACCESS BRAZILIAN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS	BIBLIOTECAS-ANALES DE INVESTIGACION			Portuguese	Article						Scientific journal; Open access; Altmetrics; Repercussion on the social web		Objective. Identify the altmetric indicator of the social impact of Brazilian open access scientific journals. Design/Methodology/Approach. The study origins in a survey of the ISSN Agency database, whose results confirmed the existence of 1,393 journals. After organizing the data in an Excel spreadsheet, using the Altmetrics. com Platform, the impact on the social web was verified. Results/Discussion. 100,454 mentions were revealed, referring to 548 magazines, Twitter being the most used social network; most magazines have between one and ten mentions; nine of the ten articles with the greatest repercussion are in English; the University of Sao Paulo was the most prominent publisher; and the area of knowledge with the most attention was Medical and Health Sciences. Conclusion. There was a precarious dissemination and scientific circulation of Brazilian open access journals, since more than half (61%) are not mentioned in the networks. This result leads to affirm that visibility must be worked on, considering that it influences the popularization of information and the society's interest in science. It is recommended that magazines use the different means of dissemination, thus increasing the degree of exposure on the social web. Originality/Value. The emergence of surveys able to measure the appropriation and use of the social web is interesting, because, nowadays, surveys indicate that the web presents itself as the digital environment in which users spend the most time when they are connected. Even with this effervescent trend, few studies address the subject with a focus on scientific journals.

We term this approach biologically-assisted sampling (BAS). We used Egyptian fruit bats to map the spatial air temperature (Tair) profile. To demonstrate the feasibility of using biologically-assisted sampled data set, we run mixed effects and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models to estimate the impact of urban environment on Tair distribution. Our results suggest that vegetation is a very important mitigating factor in Tair. In the winter, we found an average Tair difference of 2-5 degrees C between densely urban and nearby vegetative/open areas. A distinct UHI spot was identified in the winter, centered on the Ayalon highway. These differences were lower during the summer night, probably due to a pronounced cooling sea breeze effect along the coastline. Our preliminary results also indicate that BAS sampling provide a 3D view of the UHI phenomenon: the change in Tair above the dense urban area was smaller than above the vegetative area. Since the differences in Tair between densely urban and open/green areas are the largest during the night hours, bats can serve as efficient agents to monitor UHI effects, despite the method limitations.

Quality and up-to-date information is needed to improve health and education policy planning. METHODS We used publicly available data from the International Medical Education Directory and Avicenna Directories, and an internal education programme database to gather data on medical education provision worldwide. We sent a semi-structured questionnaire to a selection of 346 medical schools, of which 218 (63%) in 81 different countries or territories replied. We contacted ministries of health, national agencies for accreditation or similar bodies to clarify inconsistencies among sources. We identified key informants to obtain country-level specific information. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse current medical school data by country. RESULTS There are about 2600 medical schools worldwide. The countries with the largest numbers of schools are India (n = 304), Brazil (n = 182), the USA (n = 173), China (n = 147) and Pakistan (n = 86). One-third of all medical schools are located in five countries and nearly half are located in 10 countries. Of 207 independent states, 24 have no medical school and 50 have only one. Regionally, numbers of citizens per school differ: the Caribbean region has one school per 0.6 million population; the Americas and Oceania each have one school per 1.2 million population; Europe has one school per 1.8 million population; Asia has one school per 3.5 million population, and Africa has one school per 5.0 million population. In 2012, on average, there were 181 graduates per medical school. CONCLUSIONS The total number and distribution of medical schools around the world are not well matched with existing physician numbers and distribution. The collection and aggregation of medical school data are complex and would benefit from better information on local recognition processes. Longitudinal comparisons are difficult and subject to several sources of error. The consistency and quality of medical school data need to be improved to accurately document potential supply; one example of such an advancement is the World Directory of Medical Schools.

Benchmarking POMR remains difficult due to differences in surgical volume and case mix combined with the burden of reporting and leveraging this complex and high-volume data. We seek to determine whether the pooled and individual procedure POMR of each bellwether (cesarean section, laparotomy, management of open fracture) correlate with state-level all-cause POMR in the interest of identifying benchmark procedures that can be used to make standardized regional comparisons of surgical quality. Methods The Brazilian National Healthcare Database (DATASUS) was queried to identify unadjusted all-cause POMR for all patient admissions among public hospitals in Brazil in 2018. Bellwether procedures were identified as any procedure involving laparotomy, cesarean section, or treatment of open long bone fracture and then classified as emergent or elective. The pooled POMR of all bellwether procedures as well as for each individual bellwether procedure was compared with the all-cause POMR in each of the 26 states, and one federal district and correlations were calculated. Funnel plots were used to compare surgical volume to perioperative mortality for each bellwether procedure. Results 4,756,642 surgical procedures were reported to DATASUS in 2018: 237,727 emergent procedures requiring laparotomy, 852,821 emergent cesarean sections, and 210,657 open, long bone fracture repairs. Pooled perioperative mortality for all of the bellwether procedures was correlated with all-procedure POMR among states (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). POMR for emergency procedures (2.4%) correlated with the all-procedure (emergent and elective) POMR (1.6%, r = 0.93, p < .001), while POMR for elective procedures (0.4%) did not (p = .247). POMR for emergency laparotomy (4.4%) correlated with all-procedure POMR (1.6%, r = 0.52, p = .005), as did the POMR for open, long bone fractures (0.8%, r = 0.61, p < .001). POMR for emergency cesarean section (0.05%) did not correlate with all-procedure POMR (p = 0.400). There was a correlation between surgical volume and emergency laparotomy POMR (r = - 0.53, p = .004), but not for emergency cesarean section or open, long bone fractures POMR. Conclusion Procedure-specific POMR for laparotomy and open long bone fracture correlates modestly with all-procedure POMR among Brazilian states which is primarily driven by emergency procedure POMR. Selective reporting of emergency laparotomy and open fracture POMR may be a useful surrogate to guide subnational surgical policy decisions.

Variability in mortality following caesarean delivery, appendectomy, and groin hernia repair in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and analysis of published data	LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							PEDIATRIC INGUINAL-HERNIA; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; MATERNAL MORTALITY; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; LAPAROSCOPIC APPENDECTOMY; TEACHING HOSPITALS; PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; ACUTE APPENDICITIS; PERINATAL HEALTH; WOUND-INFECTION	Background Surgical interventions occur at lower rates in resource-poor settings, and complication and death rates following surgery are probably substantial but have not been well quantified. A deeper understanding of outcomes is a crucial step to ensure that high quality accompanies increased global access to surgical care. We aimed to assess surgical mortality following three common surgical procedures-caesarean delivery, appendectomy, and groin (inguinal and femoral) hernia repair-to quantify the potential risks of expanding access without simultaneously addressing issues of quality and safety. Methods We collected demographic, health, and economic data for 113 countries classified as low income or lower-middle income by the World Bank in 2005. We did a systematic review of Ovid, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Scopus from Jan 1, 2000, to Jan 15, 2015, to identify studies in these countries reporting all-cause mortality following the three commonly undertaken operations. Reports from governmental and other agencies were also identified and included. We modelled surgical mortality rates for countries without reported data using a two-step multiple imputation method. We first used a fully conditional specification (FCS) multiple imputation method to establish complete datasets for all missing variables that we considered potentially predictive of surgical mortality. We then used regression-based predictive mean matching imputation methods, specified within the multiple imputation FCS method, for selected predictors for each operation using the completed dataset to predict mortality rates along with confidence intervals for countries without reported mortality data. To account for variability in data availability, we aggregated results by subregion and estimated surgical mortality rates. Findings From an initial 1302 articles and reports identified, 247 full-text articles met our inclusion criteria, and 124 provided data for surgical mortality for at least one of the three selected operations. We identified 42 countries with mortality data for at least one of the three procedures. Median reported mortality was 7.9 per 1000 operations for caesarean delivery (IQR 2.8-19.9), 2.2 per 1000 operations for appendectomy (0.0-17.2), and 4.9 per 1000 operations for groin hernia (0.0-11.7). Perioperative mortality estimates by subregion ranged from 2.8 (South Asia) to 50.2 (East Asia) per 1000 caesarean deliveries, 2.4 (South Asia) to 54.0 (Central sub-Saharan Africa) per 1000 appendectomies, and 0.3 (Andean Latin America) to 25.5 (Southern sub-Saharan Africa) per 1000 hernia repairs. Interpretation All-cause postoperative mortality rates are exceedingly variable within resource-constrained environments. Eff orts to expand surgical access and provision of services must include a strong commitment to improve the safety and quality of care. Copyright (C) Uribe-Leitz et al.

Estimating total spending by source of funding on routine and supplementary immunisation activities in low-income and middle-income countries, 2000-17: a financial modelling study	LANCET			English	Article							10 PATHOGENS; INVESTMENT; RETURN	Background Childhood immunisation is one of the most cost-effective health interventions. However, despite its known value, global access to vaccines remains far from complete. Although supply-side constraints lead to inadequate vaccine coverage in many health systems, there is no comprehensive analysis of the funding for immunisation. We aimed to fill this gap by generating estimates of funding for immunisation disaggregated by the source of funding and the type of activities in order to highlight the funding landscape for immunisation and inform policy making. Methods For this financial modelling study, we estimated annual spending on immunisations for 135 low-income and middle-income countries (as determined by the World Bank) from 2000 to 2017, with a focus on government, donor, and out-of-pocket spending, and disaggregated spending for vaccines and delivery costs, and routine schedules and supplementary campaigns. To generate these estimates, we extracted data from National Health Accounts, the WHO-UNICEF Joint Reporting Forms, comprehensive multi-year plans, databases from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's 2019 development assistance for health database. We estimated total spending on immunisation by aggregating the government, donor, prepaid private, and household spending estimates. Findings Between 2000 and 2017, funding for immunisation totalled US$112.4 billion (95% uncertainty interval 108.5-118.5). Aggregated across all low-income and middle-income countries, government spending consistently remained the largest source of funding, providing between 60.0% (57.7-61.9) and 79.3% (73.8-81.4) of total immunisation spending each year (corresponding to between $2.5 billion [2.3-2.8] and $6.4 billion [6.0-7.0] each year). Across income groups, immunisation spending per surviving infant was similar in low-income and lower-middle-income countries and territories, with average spending of $40 (38-42) in low-income countries and $42 (39-46) in lower-middle-income countries, in 2017. In low-income countries and territories, development assistance made up the largest share of total immunisation spending (69.4% [64.6-72.0]; $630.2 million) in 2017. Across the 135 countries, we observed higher vaccine coverage and increased government spending on immunisation over time, although in some countries, predominantly in Latin America and the Caribbean and in sub-Saharan Africa, vaccine coverage decreased over time, while spending increased. Interpretation These estimates highlight the progress over the past two decades in increasing spending on immunisation. However, many challenges still remain and will require dedication and commitment to ensure that the progress made in the previous decade is sustained and advanced in the next decade for the Immunization Agenda 2030.

Reimagining leprosy elimination with AI analysis of a combination of skin lesion images with demographic and clinical data	LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-AMERICAS			English	Article						Leprosy; Artificial intelligence; AI; Image-based diagnosis; Dermatology; Skin lesions; AI4leprosy		Background Leprosy is an infectious disease that mostly affects underserved populations. Although it has been largely eliminated, still about 200'000 new patients are diagnosed annually. In the absence of a diagnostic test, clinical diagnosis is often delayed, potentially leading to irreversible neurological damage and its resulting stigma, as well as continued transmission. Accelerating diagnosis could significantly contribute to advancing global leprosy elimination. Digital and Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven technology has shown potential to augment health workers abilities in making faster and more accurate diagnosis, especially when using images such as in the fields of dermatology or ophthalmology. That made us start the quest for an AI-driven diagnosis assistant for leprosy, based on skin images. Methods Here we describe the accuracy of an AI-enabled image-based diagnosis assistant for leprosy, called AI4Leprosy, based on a combination of skin images and clinical data, collected following a standardized process. In a Brazilian leprosy national referral center, 222 patients with leprosy or other dermatological conditions were included, and the 1229 collected skin images and 585 sets of metadata are stored in an open-source dataset for other researchers to exploit. Findings We used this dataset to test whether a CNN-based AI algorithm could contribute to leprosy diagnosis and employed three AI models, testing images and metadata both independently and in combination. AI modeling indicated that the most important clinical signs are thermal sensitivity loss, nodules and papules, feet paresthesia, number of lesions and gender, but also scaling surface and pruritus that were negatively associated with leprosy. Using elastic-net logistic regression provided a high classification accuracy (90%) and an area under curve (AUC) of 96.46% for leprosy diagnosis. Interpretation Future validation of these models is underway, gathering larger datasets from populations of different skin types and collecting images with smartphone cameras to mimic real world settings. We hope that the results of our research will lead to clinical solutions that help accelerate global leprosy elimination. Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Scientists could use datasets to develop a new body fat measurement formula. Using bioelectrical impedance analysis, we analyzed the total body composition of 345 patients (234 men and 111 women) aged between 18 and 60 years residing in the metropolitan area of Barranquilla, Colombia. They have the potential for predictive formula analysis enhancing the cooperation among scientists. Due to the obesity pandemic, new datasets from other populations are needed to develop a body fat basic mathematical equation formula that could be used worldwide to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity in a specific population group predisposed to develop metabolic syndrome or death, secondary to high cardiovascular risk.

J	Mitchell, W; Bhatia, R; Zebardast, N				Mitchell, William; Bhatia, Roma; Zebardast, Nazlee			Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the changes in marijuana use in the USA, 2005-2018	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; USE DISORDERS; CANNABIS; PREVALENCE; WASHINGTON; LEGALIZATION; COLORADO; ALCOHOL; PRICES; MARKET	Objectives Understanding trends of marijuana use in the USA throughout a period of particularly high adoption of marijuana-legalisation, and understanding demographics most at risk of use, is important in evolving healthcare policy and intervention. This study analyses the demographic-specific changes in the prevalence of marijuana use in the USA between 2005 and 2018. Design, setting and participants A 14-year retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database, a publicly available biennially collected national survey, weighted to represent the entire US population. A total of 35 212 adults between 18 and 69 years old participated in the seven-cycles of surveys analysed (2005-2018). Primary outcome measured Lifetime use, first use before 18 years old, and past-year use of marijuana. Results The majority of adults reported ever using marijuana. While the overall prevalence of lifetime marijuana use remained stable (p=0.53), past-year use increased significantly between 2005 and 2018 (p<0.001) with highest rate of past-year use among younger age groups (p<0.001), males (p<0.001) and those with income below poverty level (p<0.001). Past-year use was the most common among non-Hispanic blacks, and less common among Hispanic/Mexican populations (p<0.002). Trends in past-year use increased among all age categories, males/females, all ethnicities, those with high school education/above, and those at all income levels (p<0.01 for all). Conclusions While lifetime marijuana use remained stable, past-year use significantly increased between 2005 and 2018. While past-year use remained the most common in younger age groups, males, non-Hispanic blacks and those with lower income; increasing trends in past-year use were significant for all age, sex, race and income categories, and for those with high school education/above. With high adoption of marijuana-legalisation laws during this period, our results suggest an associated increase in past-year marijuana use. An accurate understanding of those most at risk can help to inform decisions of healthcare policy-makers and professionals, and facilitate a safe transition of changing marijuana legalisation and use in the USA.

In Mexico, the first cases of COVID-19, was reported by the Secretary of Health on 28 February 2020. More than sixteen thousand cases and more than fifteen thousand deaths have been reported in Mexico, and it continues to rise; therefore, this article proposes two online visualization tools (a web platform) that allow the analysis of demographic data and comorbidities of the Mexican population. The objective of these tools is to provide graphic information, fast and updated, based on dataset obtained directly from National Governments Health Secretary (Secretaria de Salud, SSA) which is daily refreshed with the information related to SARS-CoV-2. To allow a dynamical update and friendly interface, and approach with R-project, a well-known Open Source language and environment for statistical computing and Shiny package, were implemented. The dataset is loaded automatically from the latest version released by the federal government of Mexico. Users can choose to study particular groups determined by gender, entity, type of result (positive, negative, pending outcome) and comorbidity. The image results are plots that can be instantly interpreted and supported by the text summary. This tool, in addition to being a consultation for the general public, is useful in Public Health to facilitate the visualization of the data, allowing its timely interpretation due to the changing nature of COVID-19, it can even be used for decision-making by leaders, for the benefit of the health of the community.

We used the International Classification of Diseases for all codes of toxoplasmosis with a specific filter for ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) from 2015 to 2019 to estimate the incidence and the demographic status of the disease in Colombia.Results: During the 5 years of study, the crude unadjusted incidence of OT was 42.02 (Confidence In-terval 30.29-56.19) cases in 1,0 0 0 patients with toxoplasmosis per year, showing a significant increase of incidence when comparing the year 2019 to the year 2015. There was a predominance of female patients (58% of the cases). The distribution by age shows an increase in cases of the disease in subjects aged 15 to 49 years (65.2%). The geographic analysis showed a higher proportion of cases in the Andean region, followed by the Pacific and the Atlantic regions.Conclusion: This is the first study that determines the epidemiological characteristics of OT based on a National Health database in Colombia, showing a public health problem and evidencing the neediness of solidifying preventive and screening strategies in the Colombian population.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

In Brazil, snakebites are reported to the Ministry of Health surveillance system and cases receive antivenom free of charge. There is an urgent need to identify higher risk areas for antivenom distribution, and to develop prevention activities. The objective of this study is to provide an overview of the epidemiological situation of snakebite envenoming in Brazil and explore possible drivers; as well as to create a flowchart tool to support decision-makers identify higher risk areas. An ecological-type study was carried out using data by municipality (2013-2017). Study parts: 1) Create a geocoded database and perform a descriptive and cluster analysis; 2) Statistical analysis to measure the association of snakebite and possible environmental and socioeconomic drivers; 3) Develop a flowchart to support decision-makers and the application of this tool in one state (Rio Grande do Sul) as an example. An average of 27,120 snakebite cases per year were reported at the country level. Clusters of municipalities with high numbers of snakebites are mostly found in the Amazon Legal Region. The negative binomial regression model showed association with the snakebite case count: the type of major habitat, tropical or non-tropical; temperature; percentage of urbanization; precipitation; elevation; GDP per capita; a weaker relation with forest loss; and with venomous snake richness. The state where the instrument was applied reported 4,227 snakebites in the period. Most municipalities were considered as medium risk and 56/496 as high risk according to the tool created. Snakebite cases are distributed across the entire country with the highest concentration in the Legal Amazon Region. This creates a complex situation both for better understanding of the association of environmental and socioeconomic factors with snakebites and for the distribution and maintenance of antivenom to remote areas. Research into types of antivenom with a longer shelf life without the need for refrigeration is needed.

Identify the main categories of analysis in the end-of-course projects completed by physicians who graduated in the family health specialization in the Mais Medicos Program. Methods. Bibliometric study of the 3,021 end-of-course projects found in the database of the Health Education Resources Collection (Open University of the Unified Health System) for the years 2016 to 2019. In order to analyze the main topics addressed in the projects, a two-step cluster analysis was conducted of the descriptors for each project. Results. Of the 3,021 end-of-course projects, 2,750 with complete data were analyzed. The profile of the authors was predominantly female, Cuban, and in the 31-40 years age group. The results show that professional training was concentrated in specific topics, most of them closely related to the goals of primary health care. Conclusions. The analysis of the profile of the end-of-course projects showed that the topics studied throughout the process of training the professionals in the Mais Medicos Program were focused mainly on greater understanding of the structural directives of primary care. Furthermore, the objective of focusing medical training on the most relevant problems in each region of the country was achieved.

Studies have invariably shown that the intensity and frequency of hot extremes will increase in the future thus increasing their associated risks. While much progress has been made in quantifying and understanding hot temperature extremes and their future changes, there are still open questions. This paper focusses on the sources of hot extremes and their changes by applying a simple and unambiguous methodology that describes daily hot extremes as the superposition of four well known physical terms that include information on the annual mean temperature, the amplitude of the annual cycle, the diurnal temperature range and the local temperature anomaly on the day of the extreme. The methodology was applied to 30-year daily temperature records from 6 observation-based datasets and 31 atmosphere-ocean global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The comparison between observed and simulated hot extremes shows a remarkably consistent picture where most CMIP5 models overestimate the term describing the local temperature extreme anomaly over most regions of the globe regardless of the observed dataset considered. Simultaneously, CMIP5 models show a systematic cold bias in the annual mean temperature and in the diurnal temperature range terms leading to substantial error compensation over some regions. This prompted us to define a new error estimator as the sum of errors in individual terms that appears to be much more effective at characterising model's performance compared to the traditional bias estimator. The assessment of future changes in hot extremes shows that changes are dominated by changes in annual mean temperatures with varying contributions from the other terms that strongly depend on the specific region being considered. Western Europe appears as a hot spot for extreme temperature changes (increases of (similar to)8 degrees C by the end of the century) due to significant contributions from all decomposition terms including the summer mean anomaly, the diurnal temperature range and the daily extreme anomaly. Tropical South America also appears as a hot spot for extreme temperature changes (increases of (similar to)7 degrees C) largely due to an increase in the daily extreme anomaly term (explaining about 30% of the full change) making this region one of the most sensitive regions in the world in terms of hot extremes. The analysis reveals that the separation of future changes according to terms describing mean, variability and tails is very sensitive to the specific way the mean component is defined including assumptions about stationarity.

CHBMP	A Quantitative EEG Toolbox for the MNI Neuroinformatics Ecosystem: Normative SPM of EEG Source Spectra	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						Statistical Parametric Mapping; qEEGt; CBRAIN; EEG tomography; quantitative EEG; open science		The Tomographic Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEGt) toolbox is integrated with the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Neuroinformatics Ecosystem as a docker into the Canadian Brain Imaging Research Platform (CBRAIN). qEEGt produces age-corrected normative Statistical Parametric Maps of EEG log source spectra testing compliance to a normative database. This toolbox was developed at the Cuban Neuroscience Center as part of the first wave of the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project (CHBMP) and has been validated and used in different health systems for several decades. Incorporation into the MNI ecosystem now provides CBRAIN registered users access to its full functionality and is accompanied by a public release of the source code on GitHub and Zenodo repositories. Among other features are the calculation of EEG scalp spectra, and the estimation of their source spectra using the Variable Resolution Electrical Tomography (VARETA) source imaging. Crucially, this is completed by the evaluation of z spectra by means of the built-in age regression equations obtained from the CHBMP database (ages 5-87) to provide normative Statistical Parametric Mapping of EEG log source spectra. Different scalp and source visualization tools are also provided for evaluation of individual subjects prior to further post-processing. Openly releasing this software in the CBRAIN platform will facilitate the use of standardized qEEGt methods in different research and clinical settings. An updated precis of the methods is provided inAppendix Ias a reference for the toolbox. qEEGt/CBRAIN is the first installment of instruments developed by the neuroinformatic platform of the Cuba-Canada-China (CCC) project.

In an effort to strengthen surgical national systems, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery proposed bellwether procedures as quality indicators of surgical workforces. This study aims to evaluate regional inequalities in access to bellwether procedures and their associated mortality across the five Brazilian geographical regions.Methods Using DATASUS, Brazil's national healthcare database, data were collected on the total amount of performed bellwether procedures-cesarean section, laparotomy, and open fracture management-and their associated mortality, by geographical region. We evaluated the years 2018-2020, both in emergent and elective conditions. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA test and Tukey's multiple comparisons test.Results During this period, DATASUS registered 2,687,179 cesarean sections, 1,036,841 laparotomies, and 648,961 open fracture treatments. The access and associated mortality related to these procedures were homogeneous between the regions in elective care. There were significant geographical inequalities in access and associated mortality in emergency care (p < 0.05, 95% CI) for all bellwether procedures. The Southeast, the most economically developed region of the country, was the region with the lowest amount of bellwether procedures per 100,000 inhabitants.Conclusion Brazil's public surgical system is competent at promoting elective surgical care, but more effort is needed to fortify emergency care services. Public policies should encourage equity in the geographic allocation of the surgical workforce.

J	Perpetua, GM				Perpetua, Guilherme Marini			WORKER'S HEALTH WORSENING IN FARMING COMMODITIES PRODUCTION IN BRAZIL	REVISTA PEGADA			Portuguese	Article						farming commodities; work worsening; worker's health; Brazil		The social-historical work dimension is fundamental to the health-disease process comprehension, at any time and place. In Brazil, since this century's first decade, the commodities production expansion and the corresponding strengthening in agro-business promoted a change in social imaginary. It is supposed that, due to technical baseline elevation in productive processing, work degradation associated to this sector would be surpassed. The following paper intends to oppose this vision when seeking to measure the main farming commodities production implications (soy beans, sugar and alcohol, cellulose and meat) on worker's health. For that, it has proceeded analysis and surveying of job's quantitative data (hiring and dismissal) and work's worsening (accidents and absences) on main existent open database (RATS, CAGED, InfoLogo, AEAT and SINAN), comprehended between 2006-2017. Despite many quantification limitations in worker's health, the obtained results allow us to alert for the severity of the problem and the necessity of making new researches over this topic.

ONCONET comprises a national network of universities, research institutes and medical institutions. The system is Web-based and hosted on a high-performance computing infrastructure based on clusters of computers. It is based on open-source software, designed to provide high performance, fault tolerance and high availability. The ONCONET began operation in 2004. Currently, 30 hospitals affiliated to the Brazilian Society for Paediatric Oncology are users of the ONCONET. Six hospitals are connected by broadband access through the National Education and Research Network and 24 by conventional Internet access. The Multimedia Patients Registry also became operational in 2004, and its database contains information on 3200 patients from the 30 hospitals. The. technological platform was notable for its low production cost. It thus appears to be a sustainable solution to the problem of delivering continuing medical education in a large country with widely dispersed health professionals.

Methods Cross-sectional study based on an administrative database (DATASUS) records. Inclusion criteria were adult patients undergoing RYGB between Jan/2008 and Jun/2011. Dependent variables were length of stay (LoS) and ICU need. Independent variables were: gender, age, region, hospital volume, surgery at certified center of excellence (CoE) by the Surgical Review Corporation (SRC), teaching hospital, and year of hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate analysis (logistic regression for ICU need and linear regression for length of stay) were performed. Results Data from 13,069 surgeries were analyzed. In crude analysis, hospital volume was the most impactful variable associated with log-transformed LoS (1.312 +/- 0.302 high volume vs. 1.670 +/- 0.581 low volume, p < 0.001), whereas for ICU need it was certified CoE (odds ratio (OR), 0.016; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.010-0.026). After adjustment by logistic regression, certified CoE remained as the strongest predictor of ICU need (OR, 0.011; 95 % CI, 0.007-0.018), followed by hospital volume (OR, 3.096; 95 % CI, 2.861-3.350). Age group, male gender, and teaching hospital were also significantly associated (p < 0.001). For log-transformed LoS, final model includes hospital volume (coefficient, -0.223; 95 % CI, -0.250 to -0.196) and teaching hospital (coefficient, 0.375; 95 % CI, 0.351-0.398). Region of Brazil was not associated with any of the outcomes. Conclusions High-volume hospital was the strongest predictor for shorter LoS, whereas SRC certification was the strongest predictor of lower ICU need. Public health policies targeting an increase of efficiency and patient access to the procedure should take into account these results.

Child stunting is associated with negative short and long term health effects and the contributing factors are complex, interrelated, and potentially non-linear. Current health information systems (HIS) in Guatemala are disaggregated, overly complex, and have limited scalability. This paper demonstrates the use of weighted correlation network analysis to visualize and explore data in a way that provides useful information for future HIS. The methods generate a holistic causal factor model for stunting that explores how cofactors relate to stunting and each other. The demonstration here is based on a Guatemala regional data set obtained from the USAID Open Data Website. First, the overall correlation network structure is observed and compared to generalized structural models proposed by the WHO and USAID. Next, quantile comparisons are performed using the outcome variable z-score height-for-age, and distinct child age groups. The comparisons demonstrate how these networks can be used as an extension of widely used methods while also providing advantages that are important for exploratory analysis. This work is an important first step in evaluation of a novel analysis method for health information systems currently being developed in Guatemala.

"Farmacia Popular" (FP) Program is one of the government's key strategies to achieve this goal. Under FP, antihypertension (HTN) and antiglycemic (DM) medicines have been provided at subsidized prices in private retail settings since 2006, and free of charge since 2011. We aim to assess the impact of sequential changes in FP benefits on patient affordability and government expenditures for HTN and DM treatment under the FP, and examine their implications for public financing mechanisms and program sustainability. Methods Longitudinal, retrospective study using interrupted time series to analyze: HTN and DM treatment coverage; total and per capita expenditure; percentage paid by MoH; and patient cost sharing. Analyzes were conducted in the dispensing database of the FP program (from 2006 to 2012). Results FP has increased its coverage over time; by December 2012 FP covered on average 13% of DM and 11.5% of HTN utilization, a growth of over 600 and 1500%, respectively. The overall cost per treatment to the MoH declined from R$36.43 (R$ = reais, the Brazilian currency) to 18.74 for HTN and from R$33.07to R$15.05 for DM over the period analyzed, representing a reduction in per capita cost greater than 50%. The amount paid by patients for the medicines covered increased over time until 2011, but then declined to zero. We estimate that to treat all patients in need for HTN and DM in 2012 under FP, the Government would need to expend 97% of the total medicines budget. Conclusions FP rapidly increased its coverage in terms of both program reach and proportion of cost subsidized during the period analyzed. Costs of individual HTN and DM treatments in FP were reduced after 2011 for both patients (free) and government (better negotiated prices). However, overall FP expenditures by MoH increased due to markedly increased utilization. The FP is sustainable as a complementary policy but cannot feasibly substitute for the distribution of medicines by the SUS.

This is a retrospective case series where we reviewed the database of visual disability certificates issued by the Buenos Aires City Ministry of Health between 2009 and 2017. In Argentina, visual disability is defined as a visual acuity <= 20/200 in the better eye, or a corresponding visual field of less than 20 degrees in the less impaired eye. The database included the following variables: year of issue, age, gender, and cause of visual disability. Between 2009 and 2017 a total of 7656 subjects were certified as legally blind. The mean age of the sample was 57 +/- 21 years and 52.1% were females. The emission was near 700 certificates per year. The age distribution showed that 62.8% of certificates were from patients older than 50 years and that only 6.6% were given to subjects under 20. The leading causes of visual disability in Buenos Aires City were age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) with a rate of 15.5%, degenerative myopia (14.4%), primary open-angle glaucoma (11.3%) and diabetic retinopathy (6.6%). In subjects younger than 50, degenerative myopia was the first cause of visual disability. Interestingly in Argentina, where the prevalence of myopia is low, degenerative myopia is found to be the major cause of visual disability in middle-aged adult subjects. Population and clinical methods to avoid this preventable disease should need to be implemented as a matter of urgency.

Cuban journals were analyzed mainly from publishers' collections, library services or open access databases. From 2000 to 2016, it was found that the national output doubled from 2000 until 2015 (over 8000 articles) and close below that mark in 2016. Overall, the Cuban scientific output in Cuban journals increased, both by space of publication available (journals) and by article production. By the contrary, it stabilized in indexed foreign journals since 2014 on, with a slight tendency to grow until 2018. Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection accounted for 66.74 and 61.68%, respectively, of the output in foreign journals. It is shown for the first time that roughly 22% of the Cuban yearly scientific output is published in foreign journals, whilst the highest quality and most visible part of it by indexing. This is the first study approaching the entire Cuban output in scholarly journals, regardless journal origin.

This study aims to describe and evaluate public data from patients treated for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurism in the Brazilian public health system in a 12-year interval. Methods: Data from procedures performed between 2008 and 2019 were extracted from the national public database (Departamento de Informatica do Sistema Unico de Saude, or DATASUS) using web scraping techniques. Procedures were evaluated regarding the yearly frequency of elective or urgency surgeries, in-hospital mortality, and governmental costs. All tests were done with a level of significance P<0.05. Results:A total of 812 procedures were analyzed. Of all surgeries,67.98% were elective cases. There were 328 in-hospital deaths (mortality of 40.39%). In-hospital mortality was lower in elective procedures (26.92%) than in urgency procedures (46.74%) (P=0.008). Total governmental expenditure was $3.127.051,56 - an average of $3.774,22 for elective surgery and $3.791,93 for emergency surgery (P=0.999). Conclusion: The proportion of urgency procedures is higher than that recommended by international literature. Mortality was higher for urgent admissions, although governmental costs were equal for elective and urgent procedures; specialized referral centers should be considered by health policy makers.

Objective: Evaluate the association of malocclusions with tongue position and speech distortion in mixed-dentition schoolchildren from the south of Brazil. Methodology: This cross-sectional study was performed using a database of an epidemiological survey realized in the southern of Brazil, in 2015, for evaluating the dental and myofunctional condition of the mixed-dentition from 7-13 years' schoolchildren. The outcome variables were tongue position and speech distortion, evaluated by a trained and calibrated examiner. Characteristics regarding sociodemographic and oral health measures (Angle's classification of the malocclusion, overjet, overbite, posterior crossbite and respiratory mode) were also assessed. Poisson regression models with adjusted robust variance were used to evaluate the association among predictors variables in the outcomes. Results are presented as prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: A total of 547 children were evaluated. Schoolchildren who presented anterior open bite (PR 2.36 95%CI 1.59-3.49) and having oral/oral-nasal breathing (RP 2.51 95%CI 1.70-3.71) are more likely to have altered position of the tongue. Both deep bite and being male represent protection factors for the abnormal tongue position. Regarding speech distortion, deep overbite presents a protective relationship to speech distortion (PR 0.41; 9 5 degrees A)C1 0.24-0.71), whereas schoolchildren with posterior crossbite were more likely to present this problem (PR 1.77; 95%CI 1.09-2.88). Conclusion: Anterior open bite and posterior crossbite were the malocclusions related to speech distortion and/or altered tongue position. Oral/oral-nasal breathing was also related to myofunctional changes. Deep bite malocclusion was a protective factor for both speech problems and altered tongue position when compared to a normal overbite.

Pediatrics 2005; 116:397-407]. Participants were healthy children aged 5-18 years. The analysis here concerns 6403 children in the Scott & White Health Plan (SWHP) database living within zip codes of the Temple-Belton area, of whom 1706 received LAIV-T and 548 received trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) in 2003, 983 had been previously vaccinated in 1998-2001, but not in 2002-2003 or 2003, and 3166 had never been vaccinated. The main outcome measure was medical ly-attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI). Surveillance culture results were incorporated into the analysis to estimate efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza illness. Vaccine effectiveness of LAIV-T against MAARI was 26% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11, 39). Vaccine efficacy of LAIV-T against culture-confirmed influenza illness including surveillance cultures of children in the SWHP database in the validation calculation was 56% (95% CI 24, 84). LAIV-T was cross-protective with a drift variant strain in 2003-2004, evidence that such vaccines could be important for preparing for a pandemic and for annual influenza. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A web-based, component-oriented application for spatial modelling of habitat suitability of mosquito vectors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH			English	Article						habitat mapping; component and service orientation; WWW	LANDSCAPE; HEALTH; AEDES; RISK; GIS	This paper proposes a web-enabled computational environment for the spatial modelling of habitat suitability of mosquito vectors. Under a component-based architecture and implemented using an object-oriented data model, we integrate database interfaces, Web feature services (WFS) based on the open GIS consortium (OGC) protocols, and the data-mining tool WEKA, coupled through Java servlet scripts (JSP). The prototype, based exclusively on freely available libraries and software components, provides basic dynamic spatial simulation capabilities using logistic regression to end-users engaged in local and regional health administration and planning but who lack access to specific software and/or detailed knowledge of spatial modelling techniques. The component-based approach facilitates system maintenance and future expansion of functionality, and guarantees the reusability of developed modules in new spatial modelling applications of health and environmental-related phenomena. Functionality of the WWW-application was validated in a study of habitat suitability mapping of the Malaria vector Anopheles darlingi, in an area surrounding the Manso River hydropower plant, Central Brazil.

Despite the effective intervention in the prevention and treatment, this reduction did not occur equally among populations, subpopulations and geographic regions. This difference in the occurrence of the disease is associated with the social determinants of health (SDH), which could affect the transmission and maintenance of HIV. With the recognition of the importance of SDH in HIV transmission, the development of mathematical models that incorporate these determinants could increase the accuracy and robustness of the modeling. This article aims to propose a theoretical and conceptual way of including SDH in the mathematical modeling of HIV/AIDS. The theoretical mathematical model with the Social Determinants of Health has been developed in stages. For the selection of SDH that were incorporated into the model, a narrative literature review was conducted. Secondly, we proposed an extended model in which the population (N) is divided into Susceptible (S), HIV-positive (I), Individual with AIDS (A) and individual under treatment (T). Each SDH had a different approach to embedding in the model. We performed a calibration and validation of the model. A total of 31 SDH were obtained in the review, divided into four groups: Individual Factors, Socioeconomic Factors, Social Participation, and Health Services. In the end, four determinants were selected for incorporation into the model: Education, Poverty, Use of Drugs and Alcohol abuse, and Condoms Use. the section "Numerical simulation" to simulate the influence of the poverty rate on the AIDS incidence and mortality rates. We used a Brazilian dataset of new AIDS cases and deaths, which is publicly available. We calibrated the model using a multiobjective genetic algorithm for the years 2003 to 2019. To forecast from 2020 to 2035, we assumed two lines of poverty rate representing (i) a scenario of increasing and (ii) a scenario of decreasing. To avoid overfitting, we fixed some parameters and estimated the remaining. The equations presented with the chosen SDH exemplify some approaches that we can adopt when thinking about modeling social effects on the occurrence of HIV. The model was able to capture the influence of the employment/poverty on the HIV/AIDS incidence and mortality rates, evidencing the importance of SDOH in the occurrence of diseases. The recognition of the importance of including the SDH in the modeling and studies on HIV/AIDS is evident, due to its complexity and multicausality. Models that do not take into account in their structure, will probably miss a great part of the real trends, especially in periods, as the current on, of economic crisis and strong socioeconomic changes.

It has the power to bring light to problems in several areas of knowledge, such as epidemiological studies, healthcare inference, and climate change analysis. Applications in real-world time series should consider two factors for achieving reliable predictions: modeling dynamic dependencies among multiple variables and adjusting the model's intrinsic hyperparameters. An open gap in the literature is that statistical and ensemble learning approaches systematically present lower predictive performance than deep learning methods. The existing applications consistently disregard the data sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions, named after Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with tens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones. The results outperformed both statistical and ensemble-learning approaches, showing an improvement of 64.87 percent over the competing algorithms on the SARS-CoV-2 dataset of the renowned John Hopkins University for 188 countries simultaneously. For further validation, we tested our architecture in two other public datasets of different domains, the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2012 and Brazilian Weather datasets. We also analyzed the Evolution Weights arising from the hidden layers of ReGENN to describe how the variables of the dataset interact with each other; and, as a result of looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously, we concluded that time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously evolve.

A case study on potato viruses in Antioquia (Colombia)	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Bioinformatics; High-throughput sequencing; Next-generation sequencing; Plant viruses; Virome		High-throughput sequencing methods are becoming an essential tool in disease management programs. Unfortunately, the implementation of these techniques in developing countries can be hindered by a limited availability of well-trained bioinformaticians and/or high-performance computing centers that can process and analyze the data with reliability and speed. In this work we present a stand-alone plant virus detection pipeline (PVDP) optimized for the surveillance of potato viruses but also useful in other plant hosts. This open source pipeline runs under Python and includes a curated database of plant viruses in addition to an R script for presenting results as a user-friendly html report. The pipeline scripts are freely-available in GitHub, can be executed locally under LINUX, macOS or Windows, and does not require data submission to third-parties or access to high performance computing centers. The pipeline was calibrated using twelve previously obtained potato datasets and validated with new samples collected in Solanum tuberosum and S. phureja fields from eastern Antioquia (Colombia). The plant virus detection pipeline revealed high infection levels of PVY (1678.4 RPM) and lower levels of PMTV (1.2-2 RPM) infecting S. tuberosum. In S. phureja, the pipeline detected high infection levels of PVX, PVS and PVV (RPM > 2044) and lower levels of PMTV, PVY, and PYVV (RPM <82.1). Results also suggest the probable infection of S. phureja by pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) and by a putative unidentified potyvirus. Hopefully, this plant virus detection pipeline will facilitate the implementation of HTS methods in developing countries, such as Colombia, where there is an urgent need to improve the current plant and seed health standards.

The present study described and analyzed public data from patients treated in the public system in a 12-year interval, in a city where more than 5 million inhabitants depend on the Public Health System. Methods: Public data from procedures performed between 2008 and 2019 were extracted using web scraping techniques. The variables available in the database include sex, age, elective or emergency hospital admission, number of surgeries, in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and information on reimbursement values. Results: A total of 556 procedures were analyzed. Of these, 60.79% patients were men, and 41.18% were 65 years of age or older. Approximately 60% had a residential address registered in the municipality. Of all surgeries, 65.83% were elective cases. There were 178 in-hospital deaths (mortality of 32%). In the elective context, there were 98 deaths 26.78% versus 80 deaths (42.10%) in the emergency context (p=0.174). Mortality was lower in the hospitals that performed more surgeries. A total of USD 3,038,753.92 was paid, an average of USD 5,406.95 for elective surgery and USD 5,074.76 for emergency surgery (p=0.536). Conclusion: Mortality was no different between groups, and hospitals with higher volume presented more favorable outcomes. Specialized referral centers should be considered by health policy makers.

Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal rinses with neutral electrolyzed water prevents COVID-19 in front-line health professionals: A randomized, open-label, controlled trial in a general hospital in Mexico City	BIOMEDICAL REPORTS			English	Article						COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; neutral electrolyzed water; nasal rinses; mouthwashes; prophylaxis		The worldwide efforts that healthcare professionals are making in the COVID-19 pandemic is well known, and the high risk of illness and death that front-line staff experience on a daily basis is a reality, despite well-defined protocols for the use of personal protective equipment. In addition, it is well known that vaccination is still faraway to be achieved worldwide and that new variants are emerging, thus additional protective measures must be explored. A prospective open-label randomized controlled clinical trial was performed on front-line medical staff from the Dr. Enrique Cabrera General Hospital in Mexico City to evaluate the effectiveness of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal rinses with a neutral electrolyzed water, known as SES, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease among front-line, not vaccinated medical staff. A total of 170 volunteers were enrolled and equally divided in a control group and SES group. All members of the trial wore the adequate personal protection equipment at all times while performing their duties, as required by standard COVID-19 safety protocols. Additionally, the SES group participants followed a prophylactic protocol with SES (oral and nasal rinses, three times a day for 4 weeks). All participants were monitored for COVID-19 symptoms and disease in a time-frame of 4 weeks and the incidence of illness per group was registered. The relative risk of disease, associated with each treatment was calculated. The presence of COVID-19-positive cases, in the group that received the nasal and oral rinses with SES was 1.2%, while in the group that did not do the SES rinses (control group), it was 12.7% (P=0.0039 and RR=0.09405; 95% CI of 0.01231-0.7183). The prophylactic protocol was demonstrated as a protective factor, in more than 90%, for developing the disease, and without adverse effects. Nasal and oral rinses with SES may be an efficient alternative to reinforce the protective measures against COVID-19 disease and should be further investigated. The present clinical trial was retrospectively registered in the Cuban public registry of clinical trials (RPCEC) database (March 16, 2021; PREVECOVID-19: RPCEC00000357).

Evolution of the thematic structure and main producers of physical therapy interventions research: A bibliometric analysis (1986 to 2017)	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL THERAPY			English	Article						Bibliometrics; PEDro database; Physical therapy; Scientific impact; Scientific production; Thematic structure	SCIENTIFIC FIELDS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; SCIENCE	Background: Bibliometric studies are used to analyse and map scientific areas, and study the sci-entific output and impact of institutes and countries. Objectives: Describe the thematic structure and evolution of the field of physical therapy inter-ventions using articles indexed in Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). Also, identify and compare the main producers (countries, institutions) over time (research output, citation impact). Methods: Eligible articles were those indexed in PEDro (1986-2017) and matched to Web of Sci-ence. VOSviewer software, bibliometric text mining, and visualisation techniques were used to evaluate the thematic structure of the included articles. We collected data about authors' coun-try and institutional affiliation, and calculated bibliometric indicators (production, citation impact). Results: A total of 29 090 articles were analysed. Eight topics were identified: "neurological rehabilitation"; "methods"; "exercise for prevention and rehabilitation of lifestyle diseases"; "assessment and treatment of musculoskeletal pain"; "physical activity", "health promotion and behaviour change"; "respiratory physical therapy"; "hospital, primary care and health eco-nomics"; "cancer and complementary therapies". The most productive countries were United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. The most impactful countries were United States, France, Finland, and Canada. The most productive institutions were University of Sydney, VU University of Amsterdam, University of Queensland, and University of Toronto. Conclusions: The thematic structure of physical therapy interventions has evolved over time with "neurological rehabilitation", "methods", "exercise related to lifestyle diseases", and "physical activity" becoming increasingly important. Main producers of this research were tradi-tionally located in North America and Europe but now include countries like China and Brazil. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

ImazonGeo was built following three principles. First, the system is based on Spatial Data Infrastructure architecture and web interface built using free software and public domain data. Second, we went beyond visualization of maps and spatial queries by providing information obtained with spatial analysis models. To do that, we designed a database that stores the results of previously defined spatial analyses and developed customized reports and query tools to facilitate fast access of information by end-users. Finally, the system is application-oriented in the areas of forest monitoring, conservation and forest law enforcement, meaning that it aims to contribute to support the protection of Brazilian Amazon forests. We illustrate these principles by presenting ImazonGeo's technology, architecture, content and tools. Moreover, we present two successful cases to demonstrate how the system is being used. We conclude the paper discussing the challenges and potential solutions to turning our WGIS-SDI system into an internet hub of geo-information about the Brazilian Amazon.

Therefore, their health status is regularly checked by army doctors. These inspections include physical parameters such as the body-mass index (BMI), functional tests, and biochemical studies. If a medical exam reveals an individual's excess weight, further examinations are made, and corrective actions for weight lowering are initiated. The collection of urine is non-invasive and therefore attractive for frequent metabolic screening. We compared the chemical profiles of urinary samples of 146 normal weight, excess weight, and obese soldiers of the Mexican Army, using untargeted metabolomics with liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In combination with data mining, statistical and metabolic pathway analyses suggest increased S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) levels and changes of amino acid metabolites as important variables for overfeeding. We will use these potential biomarkers for the ongoing metabolic monitoring of soldiers in active service. In addition, after validation of our results, we will develop biochemical screening tests that are also suitable for civil applications.

Effect of socioeconomic inequalities and vulnerabilities on health-system preparedness and response to COVID-19 in Brazil: a comprehensive analysis	LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							COMMUNICATION	Background COVID-19 spread rapidly in Brazil despite the country's well established health and social protection systems. Understanding the relationships between health-system preparedness, responses to COVID-19, and the pattern of spread of the epidemic is particularly important in a country marked by wide inequalities in socioeconomic characteristics (eg, housing and employment status) and other health risks (age structure and burden of chronic disease). Methods From several publicly available sources in Brazil, we obtained data on health risk factors for severe COVID-19 (proportion of the population with chronic disease and proportion aged >= 60 years), socioeconomic vulnerability (proportions of the population with housing vulnerability or without formal work), health-system capacity (numbers of intensive care unit beds and physicians), coverage of health and social assistance, deaths from COVID-19, and state-level responses of government in terms of physical distancing policies. We also obtained data on the proportion of the population staying at home, based on locational data, as a measure of physical distancing adherence. We developed a socioeconomic vulnerability index (SVI) based on household characteristics and the Human Development Index. Data were analysed at the state and municipal levels. Descriptive statistics and correlations between state-level indicators were used to characterise the relationship between the availability of health-care resources and socioeconomic characteristics and the spread of the epidemic and the response of governments and populations in terms of new investments, legislation, and physical distancing. We used linear regressions on a municipality-by-month dataset from February to October, 2020, to characterise the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths and response to the epidemic across municipalities. Findings The initial spread of COVID-19 was mostly affected by patterns of socioeconomic vulnerability as measured by the SVI rather than population age structure and prevalence of health risk factors. The states with a high (greater than median) SVI were able to expand hospital capacity, to enact stringent COVID-19-related legislation, and to increase physical distancing adherence in the population, although not sufficiently to prevent higher COVID-19 mortality during the initial phase of the epidemic compared with states with a low SVI. Death rates accelerated until June, 2020, particularly in municipalities with the highest socioeconomic vulnerability. Throughout the following months, however, differences in policy response converged in municipalities with lower and higher SVIs, while physical distancing remained relatively higher and death rates became relatively lower in the municipalities with the highest SVIs compared with those with lower SVIs. Interpretation In Brazil, existing socioeconomic inequalities, rather than age, health status, and other risk factors for COVID-19, have affected the course of the epidemic, with a disproportionate adverse burden on states and municipalities with high socioeconomic vulnerability. Local government responses and population behaviour in the states and municipalities with higher socioeconomic vulnerability have helped to contain the effects of the epidemic. Targeted policies and actions are needed to protect those with the greatest socioeconomic vulnerability.

Understanding the possible socioeconomic and ethnic health inequities is particularly important given the diverse population and fragile political and economic situation. We aimed to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and assess variations in mortality according to region, ethnicity, comorbidities, and symptoms. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using data from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informacao de Vigilancia Epidemiologica da Gripe) dataset to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. In the study, we included hospitalised patients who had a positive RT-PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who had ethnicity information in the dataset. Ethnicity of participants was classified according to the five categories used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics: Branco (White), Preto (Black), Amarelo (East Asian), Indigeno (Indigenous), or Pardo (mixed ethnicity). We assessed regional variations in patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital by state and by two socioeconomically grouped regions (north and central-south). We used mixed-effects Cox regression survival analysis to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation. Findings Of 99 557 patients in the SIVEP-Gripe dataset, we included 11 321 patients in our study. 9278 (82 center dot 0%) of these patients were from the central-south region, and 2043 (18 center dot 0%) were from the north region. Compared with White Brazilians, Pardo and Black Brazilians with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1 center dot 45, 95% CI 1 center dot 33-1 center dot 58 for Pardo Brazilians; 1 center dot 32, 1 center dot 15-1 center dot 52 for Black Brazilians). Pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age) for death. Comorbidities were more common in Brazilians admitted to hospital in the north region than in the central-south, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups. States in the north had higher HRs compared with those of the central-south, except for Rio de Janeiro, which had a much higher HR than that of the other central-south states. Interpretation We found evidence of two distinct but associated effects: increased mortality in the north region (regional effect) and in the Pardo and Black populations (ethnicity effect). We speculate that the regional effect is driven by increasing comorbidity burden in regions with lower levels of socioeconomic development. The ethnicity effect might be related to differences in susceptibility to COVID-19 and access to health care (including intensive care) across ethnicities. Our analysis supports an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect Pardo and Black Brazilians, as well as the population of poorer states, from their higher risk of dying of COVID-19.

They constitute a problem for the individual, the family, and society. In Cuba they are the leading cause of death in children under one year of age and in Cienfuegos they rank third. Objective: to describe the most frequent congenital defects presented in the Cienfuegos province between the years 2011 and 2018 and to determine the prevalence at birth, adjusted frequency and trend. Methods: a descriptive, cross-sectional study of the most frequent congenital defects in the Cienfuegos province was carried out, in the period 2011-2018. The universe of 330 live-born children with congenital defects diagnosis and 286 voluntary terminations of pregnancy. The results were presented in data tables or graphs as it was more feasible to display the information. The variables analyzed were: prevalence at birth per year of the occurrence of congenital defects, adjusted frequency, and the most frequent major anomalies in the province. Data analysis was carried out by collecting information in a database for which the model of the congenital malformations Cuban registry and the Cuban congenital malformations prenatal registry was used. The prevalence at birth and the adjusted frequency were determined, as well as the trend in the occurrence of some congenital defects in the province. The results were presented in graphs and data tables as it was more feasible to show the information. Results: down syndrome, hydrocephalus and open anterior wall defects were the ones that most frequently occurred in the Cienfuegos population, with a decreasing trend in the appearance of anomalies such as: esophageal atresia, transposition of the great vessels, among others. Conclusions: down syndrome, hydrocephalus and open anterior wall defects were the congenital defects that most frequently occurred in the pediatric population in Cienfuegos.

Over the past century, Lecanosticta acicola, a foliar pathogen predominantly of Pinus spp., has expanded its range globally, and is increasing in impact. Lecanosticta acicola causes brown spot needle blight, resulting in premature defoliation, reduced growth, and mortality in some hosts. Originating from southern regions of North American, it devastated forests in the USA's southern states in the early twentieth century, and in 1942 was discovered in Spain.Derived from Euphresco project 'Brownspotrisk,' this study aimed to establish the current distribution of Lecanosticta species, and assess the risks of L. acicola to European forests. Pathogen reports from the literature, and new/ unpublished survey data were combined into an open-access geo-database (http://www.portaloff orestpathology.com), and used to visualise the pathogen's range, infer its climatic tolerance, and update its host range. Lecanosticta species have now been recorded in 44 countries, mostly in the northern hemisphere. The type species, L. acicola, has increased its range in recent years, and is present in 24 out of the 26 European countries where data were available. Other species of Lecanosticta are largely restricted to Mexico and Central America, and recently Colombia.The geo-database records demonstrate that L. acicola tolerates a wide range of climates across the northern hemisphere, and indicate its potential to colonise Pinus spp. forests across large swathes of the Europe. Pre-liminary analyses suggest L. acicola could affect 62% of global Pinus species area by the end of this century, under climate change predictions.Although its host range appears slightly narrower than the similar Dothistroma species, Lecanosticta species were recorded on 70 host taxa, mostly Pinus spp., but including, Cedrus and Picea spp. Twenty-three, including species of critical ecological, environmental and economic significance in Europe, are highly susceptible to L. acicola, suffering heavy defoliation and sometimes mortality. Variation in apparent susceptibility between reports could reflect variation between regions in the hosts' genetic make-up, but could also reflect the signif-icant variation in L. acicola populations and lineages found across Europe. This study served to highlight sig-nificant gaps in our understanding of the pathogen's behaviour.Lecanosticta acicola has recently been downgraded from an A1 quarantine pest to a regulated non quarantine pathogen, and is now widely distributed across Europe.

Herein, we describe the steps taken by the Zoonosis Control Center of Foz do Iguacu (CCZ-Foz) in the last 23 years to move from an archaic and sectorized structure to a modern and timely surveillance program embracing zoonotic diseases, venomous animal injuries, and vector-borne diseases epidemiology under the One Health approach. The full implementation of the One Health approach was based on 5 axes: (1) merging sectorized field teams; (2) adoption of digital solutions; (3) health agents empowerment and permanent capacitation; (4) social mobilization; and (5) active surveys. By doing so, notifications related to zoonotic diseases and venomous animals increased 10 and 21 times, respectively, with no impairment on arbovirus surveillance (major concern in the city). Open sources database (PostgreSQL) and software (QGis) are daily updated and create real-time maps to support timely decisions. The adoption of One Health approach increased preparedness for endemic diseases and reemerging and emerging threats such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

A relational database was created to analyze different issues, such as authors, institutions, gender, subjects, and its impact on Web of Science databases. The results allow us to observe the increasing international cooperation and the existence of a small group of very productive authors, in collaboration groups close to the editorial team. The journal is also open to the professional world, including both freelancers and employed. Also, there is an institutional supporting axis that includes a small group of Spanish universities that links academy with foreign institutions, particularly Mexican, but also Asian, North American, Ibero-American and, of course, European institutions. Apart from Spanish, this journal uses English for its communicative tasks. There is a high presence of productive women (authors) with a good positioning in the order of signature and differential impact on the scientific community, also well represented in the Editorial Board. The journal topics show a major concern for methodology and evidence-based testing. The impact of its articles is relevant in journals located in WOS' first quartiles.

Methods This was an open-cohort study with six semiannual data collection waves from 2009 to 2012. The study was undertaken in two Xavante villages, Pimentel Barbosa and Etenhiritipa, State of Mato Grosso, Central Brazil. No sampling technique was used. Data collection placed emphasis on growth and nutrition of children under five and nutrition status, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels of adolescents and adults. Results Baseline data collection began in July/August 2009 with a population census (656 individuals). Between the first and final waves, the study population increased by 17%. At baseline, stunting and wasting was elevated for most age groups <10 years. Overweight, obesity, and increased risk of metabolic complications were expressive among individuals >17 years, disproportionately affecting females. Anemia was elevated in most age groups, especially among females. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was moderate. The overall prevalence of high blood pressure was relatively low. Conclusions Our findings reveal marked health disparities relative to the Brazilian national population and a complex dietary health epidemiology involving the double burden of malnutrition, rapidly changing nutritional indicators, and elevated metabolic disease risk. The topically broad multidisciplinary focus permitted construction of the richest longitudinal data set of socio-epidemiological information for an indigenous population in Brazil.

A Deep Learning Approach to Forecast SARS-CoV-2 on the Peruvian Coast	COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS, ICCSA 2021, PT III	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	21st International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA)	SEP 13-16, 2021	Cagliari, ITALY			Deep learning; SARS-CoV-2; Temporal convolutional neural networks; Time series data		The current spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had put all the scientific community in alert. Even in the presence of different vaccines, the active virus still represents a global challenge. Due to its rapid spreading and uncertain nature, having the ability to forecast its dynamics becomes a necessary tool in the development of fast and efficient health policies. This study implements a temporal convolutional neural network (TCN), trained with the open covid-19 data set sourced by the Health Ministry of Peru (MINSA) on the Peruvian coast. In order to obtain a robust model, the data was divided into validation and training sets, without overlapping. Using the validation set the model architecture and hyper-parameters were found with Bayesian optimization. Using the optimal configuration the TCN was trained with a test and forecasting window of 15 days ahead. Predictions on available data were made from March 06, 2020 until April 13, 2021, whereas forecasting from April 14 to April 29, 2021. In order to account for uncertainty, the TCN estimated the 5%, 50% and 95% prediction quantiles. Evaluation was made using the MAE, MAD, MSLE, RMSLE and PICP metrics. Results suggested some variations in the data distribution. Test results shown an improvement of 24.241, 0.704 and 0.422 for the MAD, MSLE and RMSLE metrics respectively. Finally, the prediction interval analysis shown an average of 97.886% and 97.778% obtained by the model in the train and test partitions.

The promoter of a gene encoding an isoflavone reductase-like protein in coffee (Coffea arabica) drives a stress-responsive expression in leaves	PLANT CELL REPORTS			English	Article						Coffee; Promoter; Tissue-specificity; Gene expression; Isoflavone-like proteins	RESISTANCE RESPONSES; DISEASE RESISTANCE; PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS; ELICITOR; TOBACCO; PLANTS; PCR; BIOSYNTHESIS; PATTERNS; ELEMENTS	A cDNA clone (designated CaIRL) encoding an isoflavone reductase-like protein from coffee (Coffea arabica) was retrieved during a search for genes showing organ/tissue-specific expression among the expressed sequence tags (EST) of the Brazilian coffee EST database. The CaIRL cDNA contains a single open reading frame of 946 nucleotides (nt) encoding 314 amino acids (predicted molecular weight of 34 kDa). Several features identified the predicted CaIRL protein as a new member of the PIP family of NADPH-dependent reductases. Expression studies demonstrated that CaIRL is expressed exclusively in coffee leaves and its transcript level is markedly increased in response to fungal infection and mechanical injury. Analysis of transgenic tobacco plants harboring a CaIRL 5'-flanking region (862 nt) fused to uidA reporter gene (GUS) confirmed the responsiveness of the putative promoter to abiotic stress in wounded leaves. In turn, a 5' deletion to -404 completely abolished promoter activation by abiotic stimulus in transgenic plants. The lack of GUS expression in non-wounded leaf tissues in transgenic tobacco was in contrast to the basal level of CaIRL expression observed in non-stressed healthy coffee leaves.

Faecal virome of healthy chickens reveals a large diversity of the eukaryote viral community, including novel circular ssDNA viruses	JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY			English	Article						fecal; virome; broilers; high-throughput sequencing	AVIAN GYROVIRUS 2; COMPLETE GENOME SEQUENCE; STRANDED-DNA VIRUS; OPEN READING FRAME; ANEMIA VIRUS; GENETIC-CHARACTERIZATION; METAGENOMIC ANALYSES; STOOL SAMPLES; IDENTIFICATION; FAMILY	This study is focused on the identification of the faecal virome of healthy chickens raised in high-density, export-driven poultry farms in Brazil. Following high-throughput sequencing, a total of 7743 de novo-assembled contigs were constructed and compared with known nucleotide/amino acid sequences from the GenBank database. Analyses with BLASTx revealed that 279 contigs (4 %) were related to sequences of eukaryotic viruses. Viral genome sequences (total or partial) indicative of members of recognized viral families, including Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae and Reoviridae, were identified, some of those representing novel genotypes. In addition, a range of circular replication-associated protein encoding DNA viruses were also identified. The characterization of the faecal virome of healthy chickens described here not only provides a description of the viruses encountered in such niche but should also represent a baseline for future studies comparing viral populations in healthy and diseased chicken flocks. Moreover, it may also be relevant for human health, since chickens represent a significant proportion of the animal protein consumed worldwide.

A.; Moreno, Monica; Invernizzi, Rodrigo; Pla, Rita; Luisa Pignata, Maria			Evaluating top soil trace element pollution in the vicinity of a cement plant and a former open-cast uranium mine in central Argentina	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Article						Cement plant; Dove hunting; Enrichment factors; HCl leach; Industrial incinerator; Multivariate statistics	LICHEN RAMALINA-CELASTRI; HEAVY-METAL SOURCES; AIR-POLLUTION; AGRICULTURAL SOILS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; URBAN SOILS; CONTAMINATION; CORDOBA; AREA; GEOCHEMISTRY	Purpose Heavy metals are especially dangerous because of their persistence and toxicity. Soil behaves as a sink of heavy metals by aerial deposition of particles emitted by different human activities. The aims of this work were to identify the levels and sources of heavy metal and trace elements in agricultural and residential areas in Argentina and to evaluate the enrichment of total and HCl-extracted heavy metals. Materials and methods Ninety-four topsoil samples were collected in Cordoba, Argentina (0-10 cm). The majority of the samples were subject to agricultural practices. The possible metal pollution sources were a cement plant and an industrial waste incinerator, a former open-cast uranium mine, petrochemical, and mechanical and metallurgical industries among others. The elements As, Ba, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Eu, Fe, Hf, K, La, Lu, Na, Nd, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Ta, Tb, Th, U, Yb, and Zn were measured by neutron activation analysis, and Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were partially extracted by 0.5-M HCl and measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Several nonparametric statistics were performed to the dataset in order to accomplish the objectives of the study. Results and discussion The mean total Ba concentration exceeded soil quality guidelines for residential areas, with the maximum total As and Co concentrations surpassing the agricultural and residential limits stated in national and international legislations. The elements As and Ba were found to be controlled by parent factors, whereas Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were controlled by both anthropogenic and pedogenic factors. A cement plant was the main source of Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn, whereas lanthanides, Fe, K, U, and also Zn were associated with a former open-cast operation uranium mine. A correlation analysis showed that soil organic matter and pH had strong associations with 0.5-M HCl-extracted Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Conclusions Fe-normalized enrichment factors calculated for 0.5-M HCl-extracted heavy metals are potentially significant for characterizing the element bioavailability, the anthropogenic contamination, and the anomaly assessment. According to soil quality guidelines for environmental health, the human and wildlife populations in Cordoba Province might be experiencing toxic As, Ba, Co, Cr, Ta, U, and Zn effects. Therefore, mitigation strategies should be performed on an abandoned mine (Schlagintweit Uranium Mine), Yocsina, Despenaderos, and Oliva.	[Bermudez, Gonzalo M.

Data were collected from January to July 2019 from 525 individuals over 18 years old recruited face-to-face in different places (e.g., university, public squares, health posts), using a convenient, intentional, and reasoned sampling. In addition to the FCQ, socioeconomic data were collected from printed questionnaires. Answers were given using a seven-point scale, ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree. After Confirmatory factor analysis led to the rejection of the original FCQ structure, exploratory factor analysis was performed. Eight factors were extracted and named: nutritional composition, mood, health, sensory appeal, price, preparation convenience, familiarity, and purchase convenience. Other analyses were performed and led to a previously published discussion about food choice criteria hierarchy and associated factors. Researchers and practitioners can further use data from this survey in science and practice. These data can be useful for product development, nutritional counseling, and public health policies development. Furthermore, the FCQ is a widely used instrument, and comparisons between results obtained in different samples can bring meaningful contributions to the study of consumer behavior.

Thus, the objective of this research was to know and analyze the propositions of occupational therapists in Brazil who have been doing for and in School. To this end, a mapping review was carried out in the SciELO library and in the following Brazilian journals: Cadernos Brasileiros de Terapia Ocupacional and Revista de Terapia Ocupacional da Universidade de Sao Paulo, in an open period until the end of 2018. With this survey and its systematization, 36 texts were collected that articulated "occupational therapy and school/education". At the same time, during 2017, six interviews were conducted with Brazilian researchers who worked on the interface of occupational therapy and education. The collected data set and its analysis led to the elaboration of four thematic axes that configured and delimited the arguments used to support and problematize therapeutic-occupational propositions in dialogue with the Education sector, specifically in schools. It was evident a prevalence of practices aimed at children with disabilities under an individualized perspective approach and associated with the production of/in health has been evidenced. Simultaneously, there has been an increase in the number of proposition solutions aimed at early childhood education and socially vulnerable youth; notably, those included found in popular and poverty impoverished contexts, outlined in the individual/collective transition. It should be emphasized that the energy to designate education as a particular field of intervention for occupational therapists, with its methodological approach, technical knowledge, and specific populations, is still under construction in development and in dispute within occupational therapy itself.

J	Hyeda, A; da Costa, ESM; Kowalski, SC				Hyeda, Adriano; da Costa, Elide Sbardellotto Mariano; Kowalski, Sergio Candido			The Negative Impact of the New Coronavirus Pandemic on the Trend of Breast Biopsies and Their Direct Costs: Interrupted Time Series Analysis	VALUE IN HEALTH REGIONAL ISSUES			English	Article						biopsy; breast cancer; COVID-19; public health administration	CANCER; REGRESSION; MORTALITY	Objectives: The overload of health services because of the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the population's access to treatment and prevention of other diseases. This study aimed to identify whether there was a change in the trend of breast biopsies and their direct costs during the COVID-19 pandemic in a developing country's public and universal healthcare system.Methods: This was an ecological time series study of mammograms and breast biopsies in women aged 30 years or older from an open-access data set of the Public Health System of Brazil from 2017 to July 2021.Results: In 2020, there was a reduction of-40.9% in mammograms and-7.9% in breast biopsies compared with the pre-pandemic period. From 2017 to 2020, there was an increase in the breast biopsies ratio per mammogram (1.37%-2.55%), the percentage of Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) IV and V mammograms (0.79%-1.14%), and the annual direct cost of breast biopsies (Brazilian Real 3 477410.00 to Brazilian Real 7 334 910.00). In the time series, the negative impact of the pandemic was lower on BI-RADS IV to V mammograms than on BI-RADS 0 to III. There was an association between the trend of breast biopsies and BI-RADS IV to V mammography.Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic harmed the increasing trend of breast biopsies, their total direct costs, BI-RADS 0 to III and IV to V mammograms, observed in the prepandemic period. Furthermore, there was a tendency to screen women at a higher risk for breast cancer during the pandemic.

This is a descriptive and retrospective study with a qualitative-quantitative approach using a secondary data source of public access, between 2012 and 2017. A database was deve-loped to characterize the PC of medications and their contributions, which allowed the identifica-tion of cases of reversals between the preliminary and final recommendation of CONITEC. We analyzed the contributions in cases of reversal for characterization of argumentative axes and type of basis. Of the 307 demands for incorporation of medications, 205 went through PC, with 23,894 contributions. The reversal of the recommenda-tions occurred in 9% of the open PC (15 medica-tions), all in the sense of non-incorporation for incorporation. Main argumentative axes dealt with clinical benefits and minor adverse events, with prevalence of the submission of clinical expe-riences and opinions. Advances in the processes of incorporation of technologies in the SUS by per-forming PC were found and the challenge that de-cision makers face in institutional spaces for the improvement of social participation to strengthen the public benefit was clear.

Several courses offered in this modality use the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) known as Moodle to support the process of teaching and learning. However, some managerial needs are not optimized in this VLE, especially regarding the administration of students and tutors information. Because of this, the monitoring process carried out by the work teams in the educational institutions might become expensive and time-consuming. Although the data is in a single database in Moodle, it is not a practical activity retrieving the information. Therefore, in face of this reality, the Open University of Brazilian National Health System in partnership with the Federal University of Maranhao (UNA-SUS/UFMA) and other higher education institutions developed the Monitoring System, a tool that makes easier the decision-making and the didactic strategies elaboration using data from Moodle. This paper aims to present the Monitoring System, that enabled data management in a faster and online way, requiring less effort of the monitoring team to generate useful information for a satisfactory course control and progress, resulting in a significant reduction in the time spent by UNA-SUS/UFMA monitoring team to manage students and tutors data	[Monier, Elza; Gatinho, Fatima; Oliveira, Ana Emilia; Rabelo, Aldrea; Martins, Romulo] Univ Fed Maranhao, UNA SUS, Sao Luis, Brazil	Universidade Federal do Maranhao	Monier, E (corresponding author), Univ Fed Maranhao, UNA SUS, Sao Luis, Brazil.	bernardes.elza@gmail.com		Oliveira, Ana Emilia/0000-0003-4371-4815				Brazilian Association for Distance Education, 2015, AN REP DIST LEARN BR; Groenwold RHH, 2013, BMC MED EDUC, V13, DOI 10.1186/1472-6920-13-93; Hannel K., 2016, REV NOVAS TECNOLOGIA, V14; Kraemer D.

Objective To identify the ADRs associated with the use of biological drugs in Colombia. Methods This was a retrospective study of ADR reports from 2014 to 2019, contained in the database of Audifarma SA pharmacovigilance program. The ADRs, groups of associated drugs, and affected organs were classified. Results In total, 5,415 reports of ADRs associated with biological drugs were identified in 78 Colombian cities. A total of 76.1% of the cases corresponded to women. The majority were classified as type A (55.0%) and B (28.9%), and 16.7% were serious cases. The respiratory tract was the most affected organ system (16.8%), followed by the skin and appendages (15.6%). Antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drugs accounted for 70.6% of the reports, and the drugs related to the greatest number of ADRs were adalimumab (12.2%) and etanercept (11.6%). Conclusions The reporting of ADRs has increased in recent years and these reactions are mostly classified as tyoe A or B, categorized as serious in almost one-fifth of the reported cases and associated mainly with immunomodulators and antineoplastic agents.

BYPASS Registry Study Grp	Valve Heart Surgery in Brazil - The BYPASS Registry Analysis	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						Aortic Valve; Hospital Mortality, Public Health; Access to Information, Heart Valve Diseases; Cardiac Surgical Procedures	ASSOCIATION; REPLACEMENT; OUTCOMES; PROFILE; SOCIETY	Objective: To analyze the profile and outcomes of patients who underwent valve heart surgery in Brazil, using information retrieved from the Brazilian Registry of Cardiovascular Surgeries in Adults (BYPASS Registry) database. Methods: This is a multicenter cohort study, evaluating 920 patients submitted to heart valve surgery. Demographics and postoperative clinical outcomes were assessed and compared to estimate mortality risk using the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE). Results: Isolated aortic valve replacement was the most frequently performed surgery (34%), followed by isolated mitral valve replacement (24.9%). Valve repair was performed in 21% of mitral procedures. Minimally invasive access was performed in 1.6% and the most frequent postoperative complications were arrhythmias (22.6%), infections (5.7%), and low-output syndrome (5.1%). Operations covered by the public health system accounted for 80.8% and the hospital mortality rate was 7.3%. Conclusion: The most frequent isolated valve surgery in Brazil is the aortic valve replacement by conventional open access and the rheumatic disease is still the main etiology for valve surgery. The BYPASS Registry has a fundamental role to provide information on the profile of patients with valve heart disease in our country in order to delineate adequate strategies for health promotion and resource allocation for cardiac surgery.

Hantavirus Study Grp	Proteinuria in Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome: A Frequent Finding Linked To Mortality	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome; Andes virus; Proteinuria; Mortality	ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY	Objectives: To determine the relative frequency and prognosis value of proteinuria in hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) due to Andes virus. Methods: This observational analytical study prospectively obtained data from patients admitted to 12 health centers in nine Chilean cities between 2001 and 2018. Only patients with confirmed Andes virus HCPS and laboratory characterization that included qualitative proteinuria determination at admission were considered. Results: The database involved 175 patients, 95 of them had a measurement of urine protein at the time of hospital admission. They were mainly male (71%) and the median age was 35 [22-47] years. Median duration of the febrile prodromal time was 5 [4-7] days. Hospital length of stay and hospital mortality rate were 10 [7-14] days and 21.1%, respectively. Seventy-three patients (77%) were identified with proteinuria at admission, which was associated with increased mortality rate (26% versus 5%, p = 0.036) and the relative risk was 1.3 [1.1-1.6], p = 0.002. Conclusions: Proteinuria is a frequent finding in patients with HCPS, which is associated with a higher mortality rate. (c) 2021 The Authors.

J	Alves, JG; Figueiroa, JN; Urquia, ML				Alves, Joao Guilherme; Figueiroa, Jose Natal; Urquia, Marcelo Luis			Impact of COVID-19 on immunization of Brazilian infants	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Vaccine; Infants; Brazil; COVID-19; Immunization policy; Interrupted time series analysis		Objective: To examine recent vaccination trends among Brazilian children during their first year of life, and the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on these trends. Methods: Monthly vaccination and birth data from the DATASUS (Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System) database of the Ministry of Health of Brazil were obtained from January 2017 to December 2020. Interrupted time series analysis was used to compare vaccination trends before and after March 2020, when isolation measures were first implemented in Brazil. Results: There was no strong evidence of a significant change in trends during the study period, or before and during the pandemic at national level. However, the mean number of vaccinations per child was 10.6, which is lower than the 13 doses expected under the immunization schedule. Conclusions: Although the pandemic did not appreciably impact on vaccinations, incomplete immunization among children aged <1 year in Brazil is cause for concern. A potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific antigens or regional and sociodemographic disparities in vaccinations cannot be ruled out without further research. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Because of its urgencies, it has vulnerabilities and risks that hinder the quality of hospital management. Technological management tools are effective in improving processes and strategic administration because they provide information reliability. The aim of this work is to propose to the Brazilian Federal University Hospitals (FUH's) the use of an open source Business Intelligence (BI) tool, Pentaho, to analyze the Hospital Occupancy Rate (HOR) and support clinical decision making. This paper describes BI and Pentaho, as well as the main points of the E-EFI-01 efficiency documentation established by the National Agency of Supplementary Health (NASH), with emphasis on the hospital indicator Occupancy Rate. Through Pentaho, is made the data extraction and the transformation, as well as loading them into the Data Warehouse (DW), all based on a relational database of the Brazilian Hospital Services Company (BHSC). After that, dimensional cubes are created for the generation of graphic panels in dashboards. It can be seen that most BHSC hospitals are not yet adequately using their operational beds, being outside the goal established by NASH. Several steps are taken to achieve efficient hospital administration, but the joint working of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions with the health area and its standards, provides a major step towards efficient hospital management.

Recently, studies have discussed reports of patients infected with COVID-19 associated with vesicular manifestations of Herpes Zoster. The objective of this study was to compare the data from the Unified Health System (SUS) on the number of diagnoses of Herpes Zoster from March to August from 2017 to 2019, with the same period in 2020, in the five Brazilian regions (North, Northeast, Southeast, South, and Midwest). The data were extracted from the public database (DATASUS) of Brazil's Ministry of Health. The data showed an increase in the number of Herpes Zoster diagnoses over the years and the negative impact from the COVID-19 disease, revealing an average increase corresponding to an extra 10.7 cases per million inhabitants during the pandemic in all Brazilian Regions. Therefore, although the association between HZ and COVID-19 is not well established, we observed in this study an increase in HZ cases during the COVID -19 pandemic, which suggests a correlation between these diseases. ? 2021 The Authors.

RESULTS: Most patients were female and adults. A total of 66,577 varicose vein surgeries were performed in public hospitals and outpatient clinics in Sao Paulo, with a statistically significant increase for both unilateral (p=0.003) and bilateral (p<0.001) procedures. Since 2016, unilateral procedures have been performed more frequently than bilateral procedures. Most procedures were associated with same-day (54.8%) or next-day (32%) discharge. The in-hospital mortality rate was 0.0045%. The total amount reimbursed was $20,693,437.94, corresponding to a mean value of $310.82 per procedure.CONCLUSION: Surgeries to treat chronic vein disease totaled 66,577 in 11 years, demanding $20,693,437.94 from the public health system. The majority of treated patients were female, over 40 years of age, and local residents. Procedure rates have increased over the years. The in-hospital mortality rate was very low (0.0045%).

Mexico remained on the list of the ten countries with the highest case fatality rate (CFR) in adults. It is of interest to know the behavior of COVID-19 in the pediatric population. The aim of this study was to identify clinical and sociodemographic variables associated with mortality due to COVID-19 in pediatric patients. ObjectiveUsing National open data and information from the Ministry of Health, Mexico, this cohort study aimed to identify clinical and sociodemographic variables associated with COVID-19 mortality in pediatric patients. MethodA cohort study was designed based on National open data from the Ministry of Health, Mexico, for the period April 2020 to January 2022, and included patients under 18 years of age with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Variables analyzed were age, health services used, and comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression, high blood pressure, and chronic kidney disease). Follow-up duration was 60 days, and primary outcomes were death, hospitalization, and requirement of intensive care. Statistical analysis included survival analysis, prediction models created using the Cox proportional hazards model, and Kaplan-Meier estimation curves. ResultsThe cohort included 261,099 cases with a mean age of 11.2 +/- 4 years, and of these, 11,569 (4.43%) were hospitalized and 1,028 (0.39%) died. Variables associated with risk of mortality were age under 12 months, the presence of comorbidities, health sector where they were treated, and first wave of infection. ConclusionBased on data in the National database, we show that the pediatric fatality rate due to SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that seen in other countries. Access to health services and distribution of mortality were heterogeneous. Vulnerable groups were patients younger than 12 months and those with comorbidities.

The insect colony has been maintained in the quarantine facility for over eight years but recently, significant mortality was observed in the culture. The larvae demonstrated swollen intersegments with a fragile integument. The infected larvae are cloudy muted green or yellowish whereas a healthy late instar larva is a vivid green. They slowly dehydrate and eventually die, at which point the larval body becomes rubbery and turns to black. We used next generation sequencing to identify the cause of mortality in the insects. Total RNA was extracted from 20 larvae in two cohorts, one with and one without apparent symptoms of disease, for deep sequencing on NovaSeq platform after eukaryote ribosomal RNA depletion. We identified several non-insect sequences belonging to viruses, bacteria, and fungi, but none of those showed significant abundance or enrichment in the infected dataset. The sequences related to a unicellular yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and they were among the highly expressed non-insect contigs; more than 5% of reads in both libraries mapped to the genome of this opportunistic microorganism.

Environmental impacts at the end of life of computers and their management alternatives in Mexico	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Life Cycle Analysis; Electronic waste; Waste management; Cleaner production; Valorization of materials	POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS; PRINTED-CIRCUIT BOARDS; WASTE RECYCLING SITE; CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ELECTRONIC WASTE; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; RECOVERY; METALS; PBDES	A Life Cycle Analysis of End-of-Life Computers was developed for management of computers discarded in Mexico for the year 2014 through LCA methodology (ISO 14044) and using specialized software named Umberto (R) version 5.5.4 with database Ecoinvent 2.2. The modeling consisted in the current scenario in Mexico (10% recycling) versus four alternative scenarios: 0% recycling, 25% recycling, 35% recycling and elimination of open dump disposal considering experience in other countries and real possibilities of medium-term management. All practices of management and recycling are considered in the model with changes in the recycling rates and installed infrastructure for different alternatives proposals. On the other hand, the model included that dismantling operations are done mostly with manual labor; transportation, extraction and processing of printed wiring boards, including local process of transforming, heating and melting of materials and considering recycling in Asian countries with all the environmental burdens processes involving transoceanic transportation and metallurgy. The majority of non-precious metals recycling was considered to take place locally. A substantial benefit was identified for all recycling scenarios, particularly in the elimination of open dump disposal and the recycling of 35% of the stream and was found that there was a high impact on climate change and adverse toxic effects to health and natural environments for the practice of accumulating waste in sanitary landfills and dumpsites as well as by burning of materials (plastics and others) in open areas. The use of recycled materials versus virgin materials was also beneficial up to 10 times for reduction in global warming potential impact and up to 3 times reduction for human toxic potential. Public policies might be recommended in order to protect health and environment. As public policy recommendations, it is proposed reinforcement the national infrastructure to collect EoL computers- and transformation of materials into new commercial products, and as a starting point for the recycling of all generated materials, including plastics and printed wiring boards, but should also include the promotion of research for the transformation of plastic waste and the implementation of new technologies that can be adopted by the national recycling industry and create new regulations that result in the production or import of EoL computers and other electronics with low levels of toxic substances as their main components. Other public policies should include the legal prohibition of use of landfills and dumps for containment of EoL computers and other electrical and electronic equipment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although correct, early diagnoses of PD are important, the existing diagnostic method based on pathologic examinations only has an accuracy of approximately 80.6%. Although electroencephalography (EEG)-based assistive technology has been introduced, it has been difficult to implement in practice due to the high computational complexity and low accuracy of the analysis methods. This study proposed a fast, accurate PD prediction method using the Hjorth parameter and the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm. Method: We used an open EEG dataset with 41 PD patients and 41 healthy controls (HCs); EEG signals were recorded from participants at the University of New Mexico (PD: 27 vs. HC: 27) and University of Iowa (PD: 14 vs. HC: 14). We explored the analytic time segment and frequency range in which the Hjorth parameter best represents the EEG characteristics of PD patients. Results: Our best model (CatBoost-based) distinguished PD patients from controls with an accuracy of 89.3%, an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.912, an F-score of 0.903, and an odds ratio of 115.5. These results showed that our models outperformed those of all other previous works and were even superior to previously known pathologic examination-based diagnoses with long-term follow-up (accuracy = 83.9%).

This study aimed to assess the pandemic impact on the trend of mammograms, breast biopsies, and breast cancer stage at diagnosis according to age group. Methods: This was an ecological time series study by inflection point regression model. We used data from women aged between 30 and 49, 50 and 69, and 70 years or more available in an open-access dataset of the Brazilian public healthcare system (2017-2021). We analyzed the trend of the variables in the pre-pandemic and the pandemic effect on the total time series. Results: The decreasing or stationary trend of mammograms in the pre-pandemic has changed to a decreasing trend in the total time series in all age groups. Before the pandemic, the increasing trend of breast biopsies has changed to stationary in the total time series in all age groups. The increasing trend of tumors at stages O to II in the pre-pandemic has changed to decreasing or stationary in the total time series. Finally, the increasing trend of tumors at stage III or IV remained increasing in the total time series in all age groups. Conclusion: The pandemic has changed the stationary or increasing trend to a decreasing or stationary trend of mammograms, breast biopsies, and tumors at stages 0 to II but has not influenced the increasing trend of tumors at stages III and IV in all age groups.

Factors affecting sanitation coverage in three income levels and potential toward achieving SDG 6.2	WATER POLICY			English	Article						Population; Public health; Sanitation coverage; Socio-political; Sustainable development	DRINKING-WATER; INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; GLOBAL BURDEN; DISEASE; ACCESS; SUSTAINABILITY; MICROPLASTICS; DETERMINANTS; TECHNOLOGIES	An equitable sanitation coverage promotes sustainability, economic prosperity, and public health protection. This study examined factors affecting sanitation coverage and the potential of selected countries across three income levels (Low-Income, Lower-Middle, and Upper-Middle Income Countries) to meet Sustainable Development Goal 6.2 by developing a Sanitation Coverage Index (SCI). Nine developing countries were selected based on the following sets of criteria: income level, population, and geographical region. Twenty years (2000-2020) of sanitation coverage data were extracted from the JMP database and visualized. The SCI was developed using the service level criteria and examined the local drivers of poor sanitation coverage. Findings show that all countries studied made good progress and have commendable current status, except Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Nigeria. Nigeria has the highest open defecation coverage and may not meet the 2030 target. The SCI result shows that Turkey, Ukraine, and China have excellent coverage (scoring: 44, 43, and 40). Brazil, Bangladesh, and DPR Korea have satisfactory performances (36, 31, and 31), while Nigeria, Rwanda, and Ethiopia recorded unsatisfactory progress (28, 27, and 16). The strongest factors influencing poor coverage include population, high socioeconomic inequalities, and socio-political challenges. Therefore, the institutionalization of minimum acceptable standards, adequate sensitization, and funding could improve sanitation coverage in the countries assessed.

J	Guedes-Santos, J; Correia, RA; Malhado, ACM; Ladle, RJ				Guedes-Santos, Jhonatan; Correia, Ricardo Aleixo; Mendes Malhado, Ana Claudia; Ladle, Richard James			A digital approach to quantifying political vulnerability of protected areas	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Culturomics; Wikipedia; Public interest; Digital data; Public engagement; Protected areas	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION; DEGAZETTEMENT PADDD; POPULARITY	Protected areas (PAs) are often seen as opportunity costs and are therefore vulnerable to political decisions that open them up to public or private development initiatives. We reasoned that, ceteris paribus, PAs with high levels of public support should be more resilient to such decisions because; i) politicians in democratic societies are reluctant to make unpopular/controversial decisions that go against public opinion, and; ii) the proposed development of popular PAs is more likely to be met by vigorous resistance ('push-back') from NGOs and other societal actors. Nevertheless, public interest and, by extension, support for protected areas has rarely been considered in PA risk assessments. Here, we propose an innovative approach to assessing the political vulnerability of PAs that combines indices of developmental pressures (from the DOPA database) with an innovative culturomic-derived metric of public interest based on Wikipedia page views. Using automated methods, we quantify the political vulnerability status of 523 Brazilian PAs. Our analysis reveals a large number of PAs that may be politically vulnerable, being characterized by a combination of high developmental pressure and low/very low levels of public interest. For such PAs, we recommend managers take measures to increase public interest to ensure a healthy base of public support in the future. We conclude that digital metrics of public interest are simply and inexpensively generated, and could be easily incorporated into the existing assessment systems for protected areas.

METHODS: The following public health system data were extracted and analyzed: age, technique, number of surgeries, mortality during hospitalization, length of stay in the establishment (days), and amounts paid by the public network. RESULTS: A total of 20,119 procedures were analyzed. The most prevalent procedure was total hysterectomy (43.2%), followed by vaginal hysterectomy (26.7%), subtotal hysterectomy (24.3%), and laparoscopic hysterectomy (5.8%). Early discharge (hospital stay of up to 1 day) was more prevalent in cases of vaginal hysterectomy (39%). We observed a marked downward trend in the number of total hysterectomies. Total hysterectomy was the most expensive procedure; no significant difference was noted in the cost of vaginal versus laparoscopic hysterectomy. We noticed a trend of rising costs over the years. The most frequent hospital admission code was that of leiomyoma of the uterus in cases of total, subtotal, and laparoscopic hysterectomy. CONCLUSION: Despite the decrease in the number of hysterectomies over the 11-year study period in Sao Paulo, it remains in high demand mainly for the treatment of uterine leiomyomatosis. Laparoscopic hysterectomy has been gaining ground and showed a slightly upward trend with a shorter hospital stay. Laparoscopic and vaginal hysterectomy required less financial support from the health system than open surgery.

Despite cholecystectomy being the laparoscopic procedure most frequently performed in Brazilian public hospitals from 2008 to 2012, the lack of population-based studies led us to conduct a survey on the prevalence of video-assisted surgery in the treatment of patients using the Sistema Aenico de SaA(0)de (SUS) (Unified Health System), which is the universal, free, and public healthcare system of Brazil. By analyzing the DATASUS (national public health registry database), the prevalence of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and open cholecystectomy (OC) was calculated in the period from January to December in 2008, 2010 and 2012, taking into consideration their geographic distribution throughout Brazil. At the end of the study period, an increase in the number of laparoscopic cholecystectomies was observed, with a variation of 125.7 %. However, OC was more prevalent despite an increase in the use of video-assisted surgery over the 5-year study period, increasing from 12 to 25 % in 2012. In spite of a trend toward increased use of video-assisted surgery for treating SUS patients during the period under study, the data from 2012 are still far from being ideal. For this population, OC via laparotomy is still the most prevalent option in all regions. This information must encourage the Brazilian surgical societies to push for an improvement in the supply of the treatment provided by the public health system.

We aimed to estimate the population attributable fraction of modifiable risk factors of dementia among adults from a nationwide epidemiological study. Methods We used the public database of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) to calculate the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) for ten risk factors, including education level, hearing loss, hypertension, alcohol consumption, obesity, active smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, and diabetes. PAF was estimated for this sample after accounting for the communality of each risk factor. Findings The ten preventable risk factors for dementia accounted for 50 center dot 5% of the Population Attributable Fraction in Brazil. Hearing loss (14 center dot 2%), physical inactivity (11 center dot 2%), and hypertension (10 center dot 4%) accounted for the highest PAF among all the risk factors. Considerable variation in the relative contribution of the different risk factors was found in different regions. Interpretation This study might provide an opportunity to change the impact of dementia in Brazil. By targeting modifiable risk factors of dementia, the health of individuals in Brazil might be considerably improved. Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, nationwide studies on the epidemiology of varicose vein surgeries are scarce, none in developing countries. Therefore, we designed this study to assess the total number of varicose vein surgeries performed between 2008 and 2019 in the Public Health System, which exclusively insures more than 160 million Brazilians, their trends, costs and mortality rates. Methods: Public and open data referring to all surgeries to treat chronic venous disease between 2008 and 2019 were extracted from the Brazilian Ministry of Health database. Results: A total of 869,220 surgeries were performed to treat chronic venous disease in Brazilian public hospitals and outpatient clinics, with an average rate of 4.5 surgeries per 10,000 inhabitants per year. Starting in 2015, we observed a slight non-significant downward trend in the total number of procedures. The total amount reimbursed by the government was US$ 232,775,518.11. A total of 49 deaths were reported after varicose vein surgery, corresponding to a mortality rate of 0.0056%. Conclusions: A total of 869,220 surgeries were performed to treat chronic venous disease over twelve years, with an overall rate of 4.52 procedures per 10,000 population per year. The mortality rate was very low, 0.0056%.

J	Nezhadmoghadam, F; Tamez-Pena, J				Nezhadmoghadam, Fahimeh; Tamez-Pena, Jose			Risk profiles for negative and positive COVID-19 hospitalized patients	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Consensus clustering; COVID-19; Cluster analysis; Decision trees; Reproducibility of results; Risk factors; Unsupervised machine learning		COVID-19 is a viral infection that affects people differently, where the majority of cases develop mild symptoms, some people require hospitalization, and unfortunately, a small number of patients perish. Hence, identifying risk factors is critical for physicians to make treatment decisions. The purpose of this article is to determine whether unsupervised analysis of risk factors in positive and negative COVID-19 subjects can aid in the identification of a set of reliable and clinically relevant risk profiles. Positive and negative patients hospitalized were randomly selected from the Mexican Open Registry between March and May 2020. Thirteen risk factors, three distinct outcomes, and COVID-19 test results were used to categorize registry patients. As a result, the dataset was reported via 6144 different risk profiles for each age group. The unsupervised learning method is proposed in this study to discover the most prevalent risk profiles. The data was partitioned into discovery (70%) and validation (30%) sets. The discovery set was analyzed using the partition around medoids (PAM) method, and the stable set of risk profiles was estimated using robust consensus clustering. The PAM models' reliability was validated by predicting the risk profile of subjects from the validation set and patients admitted in November 2020. In the validation set, the clinical relevance of the risk profiles was evaluated by determining the prevalence of three patient outcomes: pneumonia diagnosis, ICU admission, or death. Six positive and five negative COVID19 risk profiles were identified, with significant statistical differences between them. As a result, PAM clustering with consensus mapping is a viable method for discovering unsupervised risk profiles in subjects with severe respiratory health problems.

We study the ex post reliability of predictions of the 2010-2011 Haiti cholera outbreak from four independent modeling studies that appeared almost simultaneously during the unfolding epidemic. We consider the impact of different approaches to the modeling of spatial spread of Vibrio cholerae and mechanisms of cholera transmission, accounting for the dynamics of susceptible and infected individuals within different local human communities. To explain resurgences of the epidemic, we go on to include waning immunity and a mechanism explicitly accounting for rainfall as a driver of enhanced disease transmission. The formal comparative analysis is carried out via the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to measure the added information provided by each process modeled, discounting for the added parameters. A generalized model for Haitian epidemic cholera and the related uncertainty is thus proposed and applied to the year-long dataset of reported cases now available. The model allows us to draw predictions on longer-term epidemic cholera in Haiti from multiseason Monte Carlo runs, carried out up to January 2014 by using suitable rainfall fields forecasts. Lessons learned and open issues are discussed and placed in perspective. We conclude that, despite differences in methods that can be tested through model-guided field validation, mathematical modeling of large-scale outbreaks emerges as an essential component of future cholera epidemic control.

In Mexico, Mexican lime production is impaired by Huanglongbing (HLB) disease associated to Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) bacteria. To date, transcriptomic studies of CLas-Citrus interaction, have been performed mainly in sweet citrus models at symptomatic (early) stage where pleiotropic responses could mask important, pathogen-driven host modulation as well as, host antibacterial responses. Additionally, well-assembled reference transcriptomes for acid limes including C. aurantifolia are not available. The development of improved transcriptomic resources for CLas-citrus pathosystem, including both asymptomatic (early) and symptomatic (late) stages, could accelerate the understanding of the disease. Here, we provide the first transcriptomic analysis from healthy and HLB-infected C. aurantifolia leaves at both asymptomatic and symptomatic stages, using a RNA-seq approach in the Illumina NexSeq500 platform. The construction of the assembled transcriptome was conducted using the predesigned workflow Transflow and a total of 41,522 tentative transcripts (TTs) obtained. These C. aurantifolia TTs were functionally annotated using TAIR10 and UniProtKB databases. All raw reads were deposited in the NCBI SRA with accession numbers SRR10353556, SRR10353558, SRR10353560 and SRR10353562. Overall, this dataset adds new transcriptomic valuable tools for future breeding programs, will allow the design of novel diagnostic molecular markers, and will be an essential tool for studying the HLB disease.

Da-ta were collected using the CrowdTangle graphi-cal interface, based on search terms in Portuguese related to vaccines approved for use in Brazil and it included posts from public Facebook pages and open Instagram profiles made from January 1st, 2020, to December 31st, 2021. The database included 3,876,408 posts (2,901,457 on Facebook and 974,952 on Instagram). The results showed an alternation of Pfizer, CoronaVac, AstraZeneca, and Janssen vaccines as the focus of discussion, fol-lowing the public debate established in the country around the dilemmas and advances related to the development, production, distribution, and appli-cation of immunizing agents. References to insti-tutions involved in the acquisition and production of immunizing agents were also identified, such as the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the Butantan Institute, and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, pres-ent among the thousand social actors that most generated comments from users in both networks. It was evidenced that the debate on immunizing agents, in the analyzed channels and period, was permeated by social media related to journalism and politicians and celebrities' pages and profiles.

The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the only multi-country nutrient criteria, and Chile recently released the world's most comprehensive regulation to identify foods that should not be marketed to children. Our objective was to examine the proportion of US packaged food and beverage products eligible for marketing to children under the WHO Europe Nutrient Profile Model (NPM) and the 2019 Chilean regulation. MethodsData for this study are from Label Insight's 2017 Open Access branded food database. Each product was assigned to one of 13 food categories, and nutritional content compared to both the NPM and Chilean criteria. The proportion of US products meeting criteria for marketing to children using both schemes was examined overall and by category. Agreement between the two criteria was examined using Cohen's Kappa. Results Of 17,740 US products, 21% were eligible to be marketed to children using the WHO criteria and 26% using the Chilean criteria. 'Egg and egg products' and 'Seafood' had the highest proportion of products eligible for marketing to children under both schemes.'Confectionery' and 'Snack foods' had the lowest proportion eligible. Conclusions for practice The WHO NPM and Chilean criteria both restrict less healthy items from being marketed to children. Regulatory agencies in the US developing policies should consider the implementation of nutrient criteria to restrict the marketing of less healthy foods and beverages to children and adolescents.

Emplacement: Mexico's Epidemiological Surveillance System for Respiratory Diseases.Participants: Mexican population confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 registered on Mexico's Epidemio-logical Surveillance System for Respiratory Diseases.Primary measurements: The analysed severe outcomes were hospitalization, pneumonia, use of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission and death. The association (odds ratio) between the outcomes and clinical variables was evaluated, comparing the three epidemiolo-gical waves in Mexico.Results: Age over 65 is associated with a higher ratio of hospitalization and pneumonia, inde-pendent of the effect of chronic comorbidities. There is an interaction between age and obesity, which is associated with hospitalization, pneumonia and highly associated with death. These findings were consistent throughout the three epidemiological waves.Conclusion: Obesity, COPD and diabetes in interaction with age, are associated with worse clinical outcomes and, more importantly, death in patients with COVID-19.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Materials and Methods: This is a quantitative, descriptive study of the universe of Latin American nursing journals (119) and scientific documents (13,208) published according to current library databases including: the Web of Science (WOS), Medline, LILACS, Periodica, Cuiden, and SciELO. A database was prepared using ProCite((R)). Results: The PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) Open-access Directory of Latin American Nursing Journals includes the greatest number of the 119 journal titles (60%). The average journal longevity is 11.3 years and Brazil produces the greatest percentage (31.9%) of journals. Of the current journals, 55% do not have international readership. The non-Latin American countries that contribute most to document diffusion are Spain, the United States, and England. The doubling time of scientific production of documents is 7.3 years and the annual growth rate is 10%; 2% of researchers form the most productive group of authors. Only in recent years has the number of contributions to the ISI nursing category begun to stabilize. Conclusions: Latin American scientific nursing production is still growing exponentially and Latin American nursing contributions to knowledge being disseminated through databases of recognized scientific quality seem to be increasing. The current scientific task is to organize and improve the publication processes. Clinical Relevance: We describe the conditions in which Latin American nursing research has become institutionalized, the challenges that it has faced, and the gradual incorporation of such research into international science.

Its treatment involves different medications, but resistance to these treatments is increasing. It is currently considered a public health problem.Aims: to identify regimens used for H. pylori eradication by age group, year of treatment and geographical region of Colombia. Methods: A cross-sectional study that identified regimens used H. pylori eradication in outpatient consultations over a 6-year period based on a medication dispensing database of 8.5 million people affiliated to the Colombian Health System. The appropriate regimens were those that included a proton pump inhibitor, associated with two antibiotics recommended by clinical practice guidelines (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, moxiflox-acin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole, tinidazole, and furazolidone). Results: A total of 12,011 patients with a diagnosis of acid-peptic disease and H. pylori infection were identified, who had undergone 12,426 eradication treatment courses. Of these, 98.0% used a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and 91.1% used amoxicillin. A total of 56.1% of the regimens were considered adequate; of these, 42.0% were a combination of PPI, amoxicillin/ clarithromycin. This regimen predominated between 2015 and 2017 for all age groups.Conclusions: The management of H. pylori infection in the majority of patients is heterogeneous and inconsistent with current recommendations based on evidence of antimicrobial resistance.(c) 2022 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia.

Though most of the patients are diagnosed at an early stage of the disease and have a good prognosis, advanced melanoma has poor survival results. For the treatment of melanoma, the combination of dabrafenib plus tra-metinib has been demonstrated to improve the outcome versus dabrafenib alone, but only indi-rect evidence is available for its efficacy and safety compared with immunotherapy, like nivolumab. The aim of this study is to review the available evidence to report results of efficacy and safety of dabrafenib plus trametinib in comparison with nivolumab in metastatic melanoma.Methods We searched in Epistemonikos, the largest database of systematic reviews in health, which is maintained by screening multiple information sources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, among others. We extracted data from the systematic reviews selected, reanalyzed data of primary studies, and generated a summary of the findings table using the GRADE approach.Results and conclusions We identified five systematic reviews, including seven studies overall that included one interven-tion of our interest, of which all were randomized trials. We only found indirect evidence com-paring dabrafenib plus trametinib versus nivolumab that came from Network Meta-Analyses. We concluded that it is not possible to decide if dabrafenib plus trametinib is a better strategy for advanced melanoma treatment than nivolumab because the certainty of the evidence is very low for efficacy and safety outcomes.

Video recordings of simulated scenarios are commonly used by facilitators. Beyond using the videos during debrief sessions, researchers can also analyze the simulation videos to quantify technical and nontechnical skills during simulated scenarios over time. Little is known about the feasibility and use of large-scale systems to video record and analyze simulation and debriefing data for monitoring and evaluation in low-resource settings. Methods: This manuscript describes the process of designing and implementing a large-scale video monitoring system. Mentees and Mentors were consented and all simulations and debriefs conducted at 320 Primary Health Centers (PHCs) were video recorded. The system design, number of video recordings, and inter-rater reliability of the coded videos were assessed. Results: The final dataset included a total of 11,278 videos. Overall, a total of 2,124 simulation videos were coded and 183 (12%) were blindly double-coded. For the double-coded sample, the average inter-rater reliability (IRR) scores were 80% for nontechnical skills, and 94% for clinical technical skills. Among 4,450 long debrief videos received, 216 were selected for coding and all were double-coded. Data quality of simulation videos was found to be very good in terms of recorded instances of ''unable to see'' and ''unable to hear'' in Phases 1 and 2. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that video monitoring systems can be effectively implemented at scale in resource limited settings. Further, video monitoring systems can play several vital roles within program implementation, including monitoring and evaluation, provision of actionable feedback to program implementers, and assurance of program fidelity.

William			Evolution of Operative Interventions by Two University-Based Surgical Teams in Haiti during the First Month following the Earthquake	PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE			English	Article						disaster; disaster response; earthquake medical response; emergency surgery; mass casualty		Background: The earthquake that struck Haiti on 10 January 2010, killed 200,000 persons and injured thousands more. Working with Partners in Health, a non-governmental organization already present in Haiti, Dartmouth College, and the University of Pennsylvania sent multidisciplinary surgical teams to hospitals in the villages of Hinche and Cange. The purpose of this report is to describe the injuries seen and evolution of treatments rendered at these two outlying regional hospitals during the first month following the earthquake. Methods: A retrospective review of the database maintained by each team was performed. In addition to a list of equipment taken to Haiti, information collected included patient age, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status, injuries sustained, procedures performed, wound management strategy, antibiotic therapy, and early outcomes. Results: A total of 113 surgical procedures were performed in 15 days by both teams. The average patient age was 25 years and average ASA score was 1.4. The majority of injuries involved large soft tissue wounds and closed fractures, although 21-40% of the patients at each hospital had either an open fracture or amputation wound. Initially, wound debridement was the most common procedure performed, but after two weeks, skin grafting, fracture fixation, and amputation revision were the more commonly needed operations. Conclusions: Academic surgical teams can ameliorate the morbidity and mortality following disasters caused by natural hazards by partnering with organizations that already have a presence in the affected region. A multidisciplinary team of surgeons and nurses can improve both mortality and morbidity following a disaster.	[Sarani, Babak; Schwab, C.

A database of the COVID-19 Tracking Program in school children was used Methods: The data comprised sociodemographic and clinical variables, results of serological tests (IgM and IgG), and real-time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results of IgM-positive individuals. The statistical analysis was performed with a 5% significance level. Results: Among 423 children, 107 (25.3%) exhibited seroprevalence with IgG, IgM or IgG/IgM; among 854 adolescents, 250 (29.2%) had positive serology; and among 282 adults, 59 (20.9%) were positive. The frequency of positivity on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was 3.5%, 3.6% and 6.0% in children, adolescents and adults, respectively. Children had a lower incidence of symptoms than adolescents (p = 0.001) and adults (p = 0.003); the most frequent were fever, ageusia, anosmia, headache, dry cough, sore throat, muscle pain, runny nose, dyspnoea, and diarrhoea. Conclusions: The prevalence rate for all groups was 26.7% in serology and 4.04% in RT-PCR. Children had lower rates of IgM and fewer symptoms compared with adolescents and adults.

J	Bojorquez-Ramos, JC				Bojorquez-Ramos, Julio Cesar			How is neonatal cardiac surgery in a tertiary care center in Mexico?	CIRUGIA CARDIOVASCULAR			Spanish	Article						Neonate; Surgery; Cardiac; Congenital; Heart		Introduction and objectives: Mexico has public and private institutions to provide healthcare to 120 million of habitants. Our pediatrics hospital is a public institution of the Mexican Social Security Institute. We report our experience in the surgical treatment of congenital heart disease during the neonatal period. Methods: From our service database, we included patients < 30 days of life with congenital heart disease, receiving heart surgery during the period from September 2015 to September 2020. Results: A total of 350 cases were included (171 male and 179 female), 111 were preterm babies (31.7%). Surgical closure of the persistent arterious duct was the most common procedure in 138 cases (39.4%), followed by modified Blalock-Taussig systemic pulmonary shunt in 92 cases (26.3%). Closed cardiac surgery (without extracorporeal circulation support) accounted for 68.6% of our surgeries. Other surgical techniques performed were arterial switch operation (N = 38), anomalous pulmonary veins connection repair (N = 37), truncus correction, coarctectomy, and Norwood palliation. Score surgical risk RACHS-1 were: I with 139 cases (39.7%), and >= III with 211 cases (60%). Inhospital mortality was 20% with 70 deaths, mainly related to cardiogenic shock (92%). Mean postoperative hospital stay in neonatal intensive care area was 20 +/- 11 days. Conclusions: Our department of pediatric heart surgery has experience in the treatment of neonates with congenital heart disease. Our data analysis let us to identify some areas of improvement in this complex neonatal management. (c) 2020 Sociedad Espanola de Cirugia Cardiovascular y Endovascular.

J	Tao, Z; Bullard, SA; Arias, CR				Tao, Zhen; Bullard, Stephen A.; Arias, Cova R.			Diversity of Bacteria Cultured from the Blood of Lesser Electric Rays Caught in the Northern Gulf of Mexico	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH			English	Article							SP-NOV.; DATABASE; SEDIMENT; SHARKS; FLORA; GEN.; GILL	The prevalence and taxonomic diversity of bacteria cultured from the blood of apparently healthy Lesser Electric Rays Narcine bancroftii captured from open beach habitat in the north-central Gulf of Mexico are reported herein. The blood of 9 out of 10 Lesser Electric Rays was positive for bacteria, and bacterial isolates (n = 83) were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The majority of the isolates belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria (91.5%). Vibrio spp. comprised 53% of all isolates and were recovered from all Lesser Electric Rays with culture-positive blood. Among them, V. harveyi (n = 14) and V. campbellii (n = 11) were most common, followed by a group of unidentified Vibrio sp. (n = 10) related to V. nigripulchritudo. Isolates representing other species of Proteobacteria included Pseudoal-teromonas (n = 13), Shewanella (n = 5), Amphritea (n = 3), Nautella (n = 3), and Arenibacter (n = 1). Higher bacterial diversity was observed in blood cultured on marine agar relative to blood agar, but gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the latter only. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of bacterial isolates were compared phylogenetically to those from related type strains. Most isolates were identified to the level of species, but some clustered independently from reference strains, likely representing new species of Vibrio, Amphritea, Shewanella, and Tenacibaculum. The present study is the first record of any bacterium from this ray species and reveals a taxonomically and phylogenetically diverse microbiota associated with its blood. Moreover, these data document that the presence of bacteria in elasmobranch blood is not coincident with clinical signs of disease, thereby rejecting the paradigm of septicemia indicating a disease condition in aquatic vertebrates.

In the stage of selecting the resistant genotypes, one factor that can be used is to observe visually the severity of the rust symptoms upon leaflets of sampled soybean plants. By being able to quantify the exact amounts of regions with chlorosis, necrosis, and unaffected of each sample an automatic method is developed to grade rust severity and to classify the samples accordingly. The proposed approach uses input images of soybean leaflets, in a range from healthy to different levels of ASR severity, sampled from controlled experiments in a farm in southeast Brazil. Images are then processed by channel transformation (RGB to CIELab), channel distribution analysis, and a clustering algorithm in order to segment the regions in three main areas. Those regions represent the main visual symptoms of the ASR severity, but still with ill-defined transitions between them. A post-processing superpixel algorithm is leveraged upon those results to arrive at a first rust intervals classification. A necrosis' neighborhood analysis is proposed to compute the intermediate areas and to include them in a final rust index. Results are given upon four different experiments: 1) 200 acquired image samples taken directly from the field; 2) 67 detached leaflets at different evolved periods of infection; 3) 50 images from a previous open database, and 4) 10 images with the standards for diagrammatic scales.

J	Bessa, JD				Bessa, Jordana de Faria			Breast imaging hindered during covid-19 pandemic, in Brazil	REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA			English	Article						Mammography, statistics & numerical data; Breast Neoplasms diagnosis; Coronavirus Infections; State Health Care Coverage	CANCER SURVIVAL; SURVEILLANCE; MAMMOGRAPHY	OBJECTIVE: To report the decrease in breast imaging after covid-19 pandemic, obtaining the number of mammograms performed in 2019 and 2020. Additionally, to investigate if there was an increase in the proportion of women undergoing mammography for diagnostic purposes, with palpable lesions. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study, based on the number of mammograms performed by the Brazilian public health services, provided by DATASUS, an open access database. Mammograms from private institutions were not included. This study compares the number of mammograms performed in 2019 and 2020, in women aged 50-69 years, stratified by month, in each federal state, and the presence of palpable lumps (physician-reported). RESULTS: In total, 1,948,471 mammograms were performed in 2019 and 1,126,688 in 2020, for the population studied. These values represent a 42% decline. Monthly, a significant decreased is observed after April 2020. The results varied slightly according to federal state; yet the entire country was affected. Rondonia was the most affected state, with 67% decline. The proportion of women presenting palpable lumps increased from 7.06% on average in 2019 to 7.94% in 2020 (OR = 1.135, 95%CI 1.125-1.145, p = 0,001). DISCUSSION: The number of mammograms performed in 2020 declined considerably. Out of the women who presented for mammogram, the proportion of palpable lumps was significantly higher in 2020. Considering the detection rate of digital mammography, the loss of 800,000 exams means 4,000 undiagnosed breast cancer cases, by the end of 2020.

This off-target effect could reduce the impact of emerging pathogens. As a readily available, inexpensive intervention that has a well-established safety profile, BCG is a good candidate for protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) and other vulnerable groups against COVID-19. Methods and analysis This international multicentre phase III randomised controlled trial aims to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the incidence of symptomatic and severe COVID-19 at 6 months (co-primary outcomes) compared with no BCG vaccination. We plan to randomise 10 078 HCWs from Australia, The Netherlands, Spain, the UK and Brazil in a 1:1 ratio to BCG vaccination or no BCG (control group). The participants will be followed for 1 year with questionnaires and collection of blood samples. For any episode of illness, clinical details will be collected daily, and the participant will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The secondary objectives are to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the rate, incidence, and severity of any febrile or respiratory illness (including SARS-CoV-2), as well as work absenteeism. The safety of BCG vaccination in HCWs will also be evaluated. Immunological analyses will assess changes in the immune system following vaccination, and identify factors associated with susceptibility to or protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other infections. Ethics and dissemination Ethical and governance approval will be obtained from participating sites. Results will be published in peer-reviewed open-access journals. The final cleaned and locked database will be deposited in a data sharing repository archiving system.

J	Roy, S; Ghosh, P				Roy, Satyaki; Ghosh, Preetam			Factors affecting COVID-19 infected and death rates inform lockdown-related policymaking	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background After claiming nearly five hundred thousand lives globally, the COVID-19 pandemic is showing no signs of slowing down. While the UK, USA, Brazil and parts of Asia are bracing themselves for the second wave-or the extension of the first wave-it is imperative to identify the primary social, economic, environmental, demographic, ethnic, cultural and health factors contributing towards COVID-19 infection and mortality numbers to facilitate mitigation and control measures. Methods We process several open-access datasets on US states to create an integrated dataset of potential factors leading to the pandemic spread. We then apply several supervised machine learning approaches to reach a consensus as well as rank the key factors. We carry out regression analysis to pinpoint the key pre-lockdown factors that affect post-lockdown infection and mortality, informing future lockdown-related policy making. Findings Population density, testing numbers and airport traffic emerge as the most discriminatory factors, followed by higher age groups (above 40 and specifically 60+). Post-lockdown infected and death rates are highly influenced by their pre-lockdown counterparts, followed by population density and airport traffic. While healthcare index seems uncorrelated with mortality rate, principal component analysis on the key features show two groups: states (1) forming early epicenters and (2) experiencing strong second wave or peaking late in rate of infection and death. Finally, a small case study on New York City shows that days-to-peak for infection of neighboring boroughs correlate better with inter-zone mobility than the inter-zone distance. Interpretation States forming the early hotspots are regions with high airport or road traffic resulting in human interaction. US states with high population density and testing tend to exhibit consistently high infected and death numbers. Mortality rate seems to be driven by individual physiology, preexisting condition, age etc., rather than gender, healthcare facility or ethnic predisposition. Finally, policymaking on the timing of lockdowns should primarily consider the pre-lockdown infected numbers along with population density and airport traffic.

All hospital admissions of pediatric patients between March and December 2020 in the southern region of Brazil were reviewed and the patients positive for RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. This region encompasses a population of over 2.8 million children and adolescents. Data were extracted from a national database that includes all cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome requiring hospitalization in Brazil. A total of 288 hospitalizations (51.3% female) with a median age of 3 years (interquartile range 0-12 years) were identified. Of these, 38.9% had chronic medical conditions, 55.6% required some form of supplementary oxygen, and 30.2% were admitted to an intensive care unit. There were 17 deaths (5.9%) related to COVID-19. Age less than 30 days was significantly associated with increased odds of critical illness (OR 9.52, 95% CI 3.01-30.08), as well as the presence of one chronic condition (OR 5.08 95%CI 2.78-9.33) or two or more chronic conditions (OR 6.60, 95% CI 3.17-13.74). Conclusion: Age under 30 days old and presence of chronic conditions were strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes in Brazilian children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings could help local public health authorities to develop specific policies to protect this more vulnerable group of children. (c) 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia.

We performed a secondary analysis using a database generated by the University of Maryland and Facebook (Facebook, Inc). We Included adult (18 and over) Facebook users residing in LAC who responded to the survey between May 20, and November 5, 2021. We Included sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, mental health, economic and food insecurity, compliance with mitigation strategies against COVID-19, and practices related to vaccination against this disease. We estimated crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios with their respective 95 %CI. We analyzed a sample of 44,678 adults from Colombia and 24,302 from Peru. The prevalence of parents' non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19 was 7.41 % (n = 3,274) for Colombia and 6.64 % (n =1,464) for Peru. In Colombia, age above 35 years old, compliance with physical distancing, use of masks, having economic insecurity, anxiety symptoms, having a chronic condition or more comorbidities, and being vaccinated were associated with a higher probability of vaccinating children and adolescents against COVID-19. In Peru, female gender, compliance with physical distancing, use of masks, having economic insecurity, anxiety symptoms, having a chronic condition or more comorbidities, having had COVID-19, and being vaccinated were associated with a higher probability of vaccinating children against COVID-19. Living in a town, a village, or a rural area was associated with a higher prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children and adolescents against COVID-19. About 9 out of 10 parents in Colombia and Peru intend to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19. This intention is associated with some factors which are similar between the two countries, as well as other factors and variations among the different regions of each country.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Register and clinical follow-up of patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome in Valencia	REVISTA DE GASTROENTEROLOGIA DE MEXICO			Spanish	Article							CANCER-RISK; INTESTINAL POLYPOSIS; GERMLINE MUTATIONS; LINKAGE; LOCUS; PIGMENTATION; MANAGEMENT; STK11; TUMOR	Introduction and objectives: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by a germline mutation of the STK11/LKB1 gene, located on chromosome 19p13.3. It is characterized by mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation, hamartomatous polyposis, and predisposition to cancer. The aim of the present study was to identify and register patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, describe the disease, and estimate its prevalence in Valencia (Spain). Materials and methods: A print-out of the clinical histories from 10 hospitals was obtained utilizing the ICD-9 code 759.6 from the Minimum Basic Data Set of Hospital Admissions of the Spanish Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs. Results: From a total of 405 clinical histories found, 15 (9 males and 6 females) fit the diagnostic criteria of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Mean age at diagnosis was 13.8 years and mean age at death was 54.2 years. Four males died, all from cancer. The estimated disease prevalence was 0.4/100,000 inhabitants. All the patients presented with anemia and polyps in the small bowel (80% in the duodenum, 66.7% in the ileum, and 40% in the jejunum), 93.3% underwent urgent surgical intervention and presented with intestinal invagination, and 40% of the patients developed cancer at a mean age of 48.5 years. Conclusion: The present study is the first register of patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome in Valencia, Spain. The ICD-9 code is nonspecific for rare diseases. The duodenum was the most frequent location for polyps and the majority of cases presented with intestinal invagination, bowel obstruction, and urgent surgical intervention. A large percentage of patients presented with cancer. It would be of interest to review and evaluate the existing surveillance protocols in the Valencian Community. 2019 Asociacion Mexicana de Gastroenterologia. Published by Masson Doyma Mexico S.A.

Neutral electrolyzed saline solution that contains reactive chlorine and oxygen species may be an effective therapeutic. In the present study, the treatment efficacy of intravenous and/or nebulized neutral electrolyzed saline combined with usual medical care vs. usual medical care alone was evaluated in ambulatory patients with COVID-19. A prospective, 2-arm, parallel-group, randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase I-II clinical trial including 214 patients was performed. The following two outcomes were evaluated during the 20-day follow-up: i) The number of patients with disease progression; and ii) the patient acceptable symptom state. Serial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 naso/oro-pharyngeal detection by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q) PCR was performed in certain patients of the experimental group. Biochemical and hematologic parameters, as well as adverse effects, were also evaluated in the experimental group. The experimental treatment decreased the risk of hospitalization by 89% [adjusted relative risk (RR)=0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03-0.37, P<0.001] and the risk of death by 96% (adjusted RR=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.42, P=0.007) and also resulted in an 18-fold higher probability of achieving an acceptable symptom state on day 5 (adjusted RR=18.14, 95% CI: 7.29-45.09, P<0.001), compared with usual medical care alone. Overall, neutral electrolyzed saline solution was better than usual medical care alone. Of the patients analyzed, >50% were negative for the virus as detected by RT-qPCR in naso/oro-pharyngeal samples on day 4, with only a small number of positive patients on day 6. Clinical improvement correlated with a decrease in C-reactive protein, aberrant monocytes and increased lymphocytes and platelets. Cortisol and testosterone levels were also evaluated and a decrease in cortisol levels and an increase in the testosterone-cortisol ratio were observed on days 2 and 4. The experimental treatment produced no serious adverse effects. In conclusion, neutral electrolyzed saline solution markedly reduced the symptomatology and risk of progression in ambulatory patients with COVID-19. The present clinical trial was registered in the Cuban public registry of clinical trials (RPCEC) database (May 5, 2020; no. TX-COVID19: RPCEC00000309).

M.; Prado, Rogerio R.; Pesaro, Antonio E.; Wajngarten, Mauricio			A time-series analysis of the relation between unemployment rate and hospital admission for acute myocardial infarction and stroke in Brazil over more than a decade	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						Unemployment; Myocardial infarction; Stroke	DISEASE; HEALTH; RISK	Background: The effect of socioeconomic stressors on the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently open to debate. Using time-series analysis, our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between unemployment rate and hospital admission for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke in Brazil over a recent 11-year span. Methods and results: Data on monthly hospital admissions for AMI and stroke from March 2002 to December 2013 were extracted from the Brazilian Public Health System Database. The monthly unemployment rate was obtained from the Brazilian Institute for Applied Economic Research, during the same period. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to test the association of temporal series. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. From March 2002 to December 2013, 778,263 admissions for AMI and 1,581,675 for stroke were recorded. During this time period, the unemployment rate decreased from 12.9% in 2002 to 4.3% in 2013, while admissions due to AMI and stroke increased. However, the adjusted ARIMA model showed a positive association between the unemployment rate and admissions for AMI but not for stroke (estimate coefficient = 2.81 +/- 0.93; p = 0.003 and estimate coefficient = 2.40 +/- 4.34; p = 0.58, respectively). Conclusions: From 2002 to 2013, hospital admissions for AMI and stroke increased, whereas the unemployment rate decreased. However, the adjusted ARIMA model showed a positive association between unemployment rate and admissions due to AMI but not for stroke. Further studies are warranted to validate our findings and to better explore the mechanisms by which socioeconomic stressors, such as unemployment, might impact on the incidence of CVD.

Prompt space-time analyses are critical elements for accurate outbreak detection and mitigation purposes. Open access web-based geospatial tools are particularly critical in developing countries lacking GIS software and expertise. Currently, online geospatial tools for the monitoring of surveillance data are confined to the mapping of aggregated data. In this paper, we present a web-based geospatial toolkit with a user-friendly interactive interface for the monitoring of dengue fever outbreaks, in space and time. Our geospatial toolkit is designed around the integration of (1) a spatial data management module in which epidemiologists upload spatio-temporal explicit data, (2) an analytical module running an accelerated Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to map the outbreaks of dengue fever, (3) a spatial database module to extract pairs of disease events close in space and time and (4) a GIS mapping module to visualize space-time linkages of pairs of disease events. We illustrate our approach on a set of dengue fever cases which occurred in Cali (659 geocoded cases), an urban environment in Colombia. Results indicate that dengue fever cases are significantly clustered, but the degree of intensity varies across the city. The design and implementation of the on-line toolkit underscores the benefits of the approach to monitor vector-borne disease outbreaks in a timely manner and at different scales, facilitating the appropriate allocation of resources. The toolkit is designed collaboratively with health epidemiologists and is portable for other surveillance data at the individual level such as crime or traffic accidents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sgambato, MR; Wahrlich, V; dos Anjos, LA				Sgambato, Michele Ribeiro; Wahrlich, Vivian; dos Anjos, Luiz Antonio			Validity of basal metabolic rate prediction equations in elderly women living in an urban tropical city of Brazil	CLINICAL NUTRITION ESPEN			English	Article						Brazil; Basal metabolism; Calorimetry Indirect; Validation studies	RESTING ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; FAT-FREE MASS; BODY-COMPOSITION; OLDER-PEOPLE; ADULTS; POPULATION; ACCURACY; DATABASE; HUMANS; SLEEP	Objectives: To measure basal metabolic rate (BMR) and to compare it with the values obtained from predictive equations in a sample of elderly (>= 60 y) women. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants and setting: Seventy-nine women living in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil enrolled in physical activity programs open to the community. Measurements: Anthropometric measures were obtained using standard procedures. Percent body fat (PBF) was assessed by DXA. BMR was measured (BMRm) by indirect calorimetry under standardized conditions and compared with BMR estimated by 14 predictive equations that included elderly individuals in their development. Results: Mean (+/- SD) age, BMI and PBF were 69.7 +/- 6.5 y, 27.2 +/- 4.6 kg/m(2) and 42.1 +/- 5.9%. BMRm (4188.3 +/- 707.2 kJ/day) was significantly lower than estimated BMR by all predictive equations, including the equation developed for the Niteroian adult population (4565.6 +/- 607.9 kJ/day). This population-specific equation provided the largest number of results within +/- 10% of BMRm and the lowest overestimation (10.6 +/- 15.4%), much lower than the results from the internationally recommended Schofield equation (27.2 +/- 17.6%). Regression of calf circumference (CC), age and body mass on BMRm provided similar estimates in comparison to models with fat-free mass (FFM). Conclusions: All predictive equations provided biased, inaccurate estimates of BMR values in comparison to BMRm. Anthropometry and body composition explained only approximately 50% of the variability of BMRm. New equations should account for the variability of organ-metabolic rates and underlying undetected health conditions in older individuals living in tropical regions.

Impact of 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) on childhood pneumonia hospitalizations in Brazil two years after introduction	VACCINE			English	Article						Pneumococcal vaccines; Pneumonia; Child; Hospitalization; Brazil; Conjugate vaccines	COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA; STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE; TIME-SERIES; CHILDREN; DISEASE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ADMISSIONS; YOUNGER	Introduction: Pneumococcal disease is a major public health problem worldwide. From March to September of 2010, 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) was introduced in the Brazilian childhood National Immunization Program (NIP) in all 27 Brazilian states. The aim of the present study is to report national time-trends in incidence of hospital admissions for childhood pneumonia in Brazil before and after two years of introduction of this new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Methods: Analysis of hospitalization data of children aged 0-4 years in Brazilian public health system with an admission diagnosis of pneumonia from 2002 to 2012 was performed comparing pre (2002-2009) and post-vaccination periods (2011-2012). Hospital number of admission due to pneumonia and all non-respiratory diseases were obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian government open-access public health database system. Incidence of pneumonia hospitalization was compared to incidence of all non-respiratory admissions. Results: Admission rates for pneumonia decreased steadily from 2010 to 2012. In children aged less than four years, incidence of pneumonia hospitalizations decreased 12.65% when pre (2002-2009) and post-vaccination introduction periods (2011-2012) were compared and adjusted for seasonality and secular-trend (p < 0.001). On the other hand, non-respiratory admission rates remained stable comparing both periods (p = 0.39). Conclusion: Childhood pneumonia hospitalization rates were fluctuating prior to 2010 and decreased significantly in the two years after PHiD-CV introduction. Conversely, rate of non-respiratory admissions has shown no decrease. These data are an evidence of the effectiveness and public health impact of this new pneumococcal vaccine. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kohler, JC; Martinez, MG				Kohler, Jillian Clare; Martinez, Martha Gabriela			Participatory health councils and good governance: healthy democracy in Brazil?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article								Introduction: The Brazilian Government created Participatory Health Councils (PHCs) to allow citizen participation in the public health policy process. PHCs are advisory bodies that operate at all levels of government and that bring together different societal groups to monitor Brazil's health system. Today they are present in 98% of Brazilian cities, demonstrating their popularity and thus their potential to help ensure that health policies are in line with citizen preferences. Despite their expansive reach, their real impact on health policies and health outcomes for citizens is uncertain. We thus ask the following question: Do PHCs offer meaningful opportunities for open participation and influence in the public health policy process?. Methods: Thirty-eight semi-structured interviews with health council members were conducted. Data from these interviews were analyzed using a qualitative interpretive content analysis approach. A quantitative analysis of PHC data from the Sistema de Acompanhamento dos Conselhos de Saude (SIACS) database was also conducted to corroborate findings from the interviews. Results: We learned that PHCs fall short in many of the categories of good governance. Government manipulation of the agenda and leadership of the PHCs, delays in the implementation of PHC decision making, a lack of training of council members on relevant technical issues, the largely narrow interests of council members, the lack of transparency and monitoring guidelines, a lack of government support, and a lack of inclusiveness are a few examples that highlight why PHCs are not as effective as they could be. Conclusions: Although PHCs are intended to be inclusive and participatory, in practice they seem to have little impact on the health policymaking process in Brazil. PHCs will only be able to fulfil their mandate when we see good governance largely present. This will require a rethinking of their governance structures, processes, membership, and oversight. If change is resisted, the PHCs will remain largely limited to a good idea in theory that is disappointing in practice.

The main goal of this study was to calculate the 30-day mortality rate postbariatric "open" surgery and the length of hospital stay of patients assisted by a health maintenance organization in Brazil. We also investigate their association with sex, age, BMI, preexisting comorbidities, and volume of procedures performed by surgeons. A total of 2,167 patients who underwent RYGB between 01/2004 and 12/2007 were analyzed. The deaths and hospital stay were identified in the healthcare transactional database and the morbidity data in the preoperative medical audit records. Factors contributing to adverse outcomes were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis. The overall mortality rate was 0.64%, with a decreasing trend over the years. The median hospital stay was 3.1 days. In the multivariate analysis, both mortality and longer hospital stay were positively and significantly associated with age > 50 years, BMI > 50 kg/m(2), and surgeon volume of less than 20 bariatric surgeries/year. Presence of hypertension also increased the risk of longer hospital stay. Multivariate analysis showed that the 30-day mortality was six times higher in patients operated by professionals who performed less surgeries/year and longer hospital stay, four times more frequent. The 30-day mortality post-RYGB is similar to the rates found in developed countries and much lower than the rates found for patients assisted by the public health system in Brazil. In addition to age and clinical factors, the results suggest that mortality and longer hospital stay are strong and inversely related to surgeon's experience.

Hanseniasis in the municipality of Western Amazon (Acre, Brazil): are we far from the goal of the World Health Organization? Hansen and Western Amazon	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Hanseniasis; Epidemiology; Eradication; Contacts; Brazil	LEPROSY	Background: Hanseniasis is a public health concern in developing countries. Although a decrease in the number of new cases in Brazil has been reported, there is a prevalence above that recommended in some regions. Aims: Considering the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to accelerate towards a leprosy-free world from 2020, the aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological profile and leprosy trends in the city of Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the epidemiology and trends of hanseniasis between 2005 and 2018, monitoring socioeconomic and clinical epidemiological variables obtained from the Information System of Notifiable Diseases of Hanseniasis (SINAN) database. Results: A total of 422 cases of hanseniasis (284 male, 138 female) were included. The questionnaire of six patients was incomplete. The highest number of cases (89) was recorded in 2006 (11.7/10,000 inhabitants). The borderline clinical form was most common, with 45.4% of cases. Throughout the historical series, the rate of annual percentage change in the detection of new cases and cases with grade 2 disability showed a decreasing profile, at -13.9 [95% CI: -19.1, -8.2] and -13.1 [95% CI: -21.8, -5.5], respectively. The same rates were observed in patients below 15 years of age. Limitations: This study reflects the scenario in one reference center and data were obtained retrospectively. Conclusions: The incidence of hanseniasis in this reference center is declining gradually; however, the indicators show active disease transmission and late diagnosis.

The aim of this study was to report trends in incidence of childhood hospital admissions related to varicella and zoster in Brazil from 2003 to 2016, including the first three years after vaccine introduction. Methods: The number and incidence of hospital admission in patients aged less than 20 years in Brazilian public health system with an admission diagnosis of varicella and zoster from 2003 to 2016 were analyzed and pre (2003-2013) and post-vaccination periods (2014-2016) were compared. The data were obtained from DATASUS, a Brazilian government's open-access public health database system, and analyzed adjusting for secular trend and seasonality if a statistically significant change was found. Results: During the study period, 69,791 admissions due to varicella and herpes zoster occurred in the children younger than 20 years. After adjusting for seasonality, the incidence of hospitalizations decreased from 27.33 to 14.33 per 100000 per year, which corresponds to a reduction of 47.6% (95% confidence interval 18.19-77.04%, p < 0.001) in the vaccinated age group (1-4 years) in 2014-2016 compared to pre-vaccination period. The changes were not significant in the unvaccinated age groups. Conclusion: The hospitalizations due to varicella and herpes zoster were decreased by half early after the introduction of a single dose of tetraviral vaccine in NIP in the vaccinated children. Further studies may assess duration and intensity of this effect, as well as the indirect effect in the unvaccinated age groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Euler characteristic as a topological marker for outbreaks in vector-borne disease	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT			English	Article						computational biology; epidemic modelling; network dynamics; random graphs; networks	EPIDEMIC MODEL; RICCI CURVATURE; NETWORKS	Epidemic outbreaks represent a significant concern for the current state of global health, particularly in Brazil, the epicentre of several vector-borne disease outbreaks and where epidemic control is still a challenge for the scientific community. Data science techniques applied to epidemics are usually made via standard statistical and modelling approaches, which do not always lead to reliable predictions, especially when the data lacks a piece of reliable surveillance information needed for precise parameter estimation. In particular, dengue outbreaks reported over the past years raise concerns for global health care, and thus novel data-driven methods are necessary to predict the emergence of outbreaks. In this work, we propose a parameter-free approach based on geometric and topological techniques, which extracts geometrical and topological invariants as opposed to statistical summaries used in established methods. Specifically, our procedure generates a time-varying network from a time-series of new epidemic cases based on synthetic time-series and real dengue data across several districts of Recife, the fourth-largest urban area in Brazil. Subsequently, we use the Euler characteristic (EC) to extract key topological invariant of the epidemic time-varying network and we finally compared the results with the effective reproduction number (R ( t )) for each data set. Our results unveil a strong correlation between epidemic outbreaks and the EC. In fact, sudden changes in the EC curve preceding and/or during an epidemic period emerge as a warning sign for an outbreak in the synthetic data, the EC transitions occur close to the periods of epidemic transitions, which is also corroborated. In the real dengue data, where data is intrinsically noise, the EC seems to show a better sign-to-noise ratio once compared to R ( t ). In analogy with later studies on noisy data by using EC in positron emission tomography scans, the EC estimates the number of regions with high connectivity in the epidemic network and thus has potential to be a signature of the emergence of an epidemic state. Our results open the door to the development of alternative/complementary topological and geometrical data-driven methods to characterise vector-borne disease outbreaks, specially when the conventional epidemic surveillance methods are not effective in a scenario of extreme noise and lack of robustness in the data.

However, mortality surveillance is limited in many low-income countries. In such settings, verbal autopsy (VA) is increasingly used to provide population-level cause of death data. VAs are now widely interpreted using the automated algorithms SmartVA and InterVA. Here we use conventional autopsy as the gold standard to validate SmartVA methodology. Methods This study included adult deaths from natural causes in Sao Paulo and Recife for which conventional autopsy was indicated. VA was conducted with a relative of the deceased using an amended version of the SmartVA instrument to suit the local context. Causes of death from VA were produced using the SmartVA-Analyze program. Physician coded verbal autopsy (PCVA), conducted on the same questionnaires, and Global Burden of Disease Study data were used as additional comparators. Cause of death data were grouped into 10 broad causes for the validation due to the real-world utility of VA lying in identifying broad population cause of death patterns. Findings The study included 2,060 deaths in Sao Paulo and 1,079 in Recife. The cause specific mortality fractions (CSMFs) estimated using SmartVA were broadly similar to conventional autopsy for: cardiovascular diseases (46.8% vs 54.0%, respectively), cancers (10.6% vs 11.4%), infections (7.0% vs 10.4%) and chronic respiratory disease (4.1% vs 3.7%), causes accounting for 76.1% of the autopsy dataset. The SmartVA CSMF estimates were lower than autopsy for "Other NCDs" (7.8% vs 14.6%) and higher for diabetes (13.0% vs 6.6%). CSMF accuracy of SmartVA compared to autopsy was 84.5%. CSMF accuracy for PCVA was 93.0%. Interpretation The results suggest that SmartVA can, with reasonable accuracy, predict the broad cause of death groups important to assess a population's epidemiological transition. VA remains a useful tool for understanding causes of death where medical certification is not possible. Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, human activities have become important drivers of disturbance in that region. The majority of forest fire hotspots in the Amazon arc due to deforestation are impacting the health of the local population of over 10 million inhabitants. In this study we characterize western Amazonia biomass burning emissions through the quantification of 14 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Organic Carbon, Elemental Carbon and unique tracers of biomass burning such as levoglucosan. From the PAHs dataset a toxic equivalence factor is calculated estimating the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential of biomass burning emissions during the studied period. Peak concentration of PM10 during the dry seasons was observed to reach 60 mu g m(-3) on the 24 h average. Conversely, PM10 was relatively constant throughout the wet season indicating an overall stable balance between aerosol sources and sinks within the filter sampling resolution. Similar behavior is identified for OC and EC components. Levoglucosan was found in significant concentrations (up to 4 mu g m(-3)) during the dry season. Correspondingly, the estimated lung cancer risk calculated during the dry seasons largely exceeded the WHO health-based guideline. A source apportionment study was carried out through the use of Absolute Principal Factor Analysis (APFA), identifying a three-factor solution. The biomass burning factor is found to be the dominating aerosol source, having 75.4% of PM10 loading. The second factor depicts an important contribution of several PAHs without a single source class and therefore was considered as mixed sources factor, contributing to 6.3% of PM10. The third factor was mainly associated with fossil fuel combustion emissions, contributing to 18.4% of PM10.

The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for the complications and death in women of childbearing age and pregnant women with suspected COVID-19. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted from the beginning of the epidemic in Mexico until May 25, 2020. All women of childbearing age (13-49 years) from the open national COVID-19 database from the Ministry of Health of Mexico were considered for eligibility. SARS-COV-2 infection was confirmed or ruled out by RT-qPCR. We performed a bivariate and multivariable analysis to estimate mortality risk. Results Ten (2.2%) pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 died. Positive pregnant patients did not have a higher risk of complications (admission to the ICU, pneumonia, or requirement for mechanical ventilation) or death than the controls. In the multivariate analysis, only history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease remained independently associated with death in the positive cohort. Seven (0.6%) pregnant women with a negative test died. In bivariate analysis, pregnant patients with a positive test had a higher risk of death than pregnant patients with a negative test (relative risk (RR) = 3.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.48-10.12), but no higher risk was found than in non-pregnant women with a positive test (RR = 0.82, 95% CI =0.44-1.53), and 60-day mortality did not significantly differ among pregnant patients with or without a positive test (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.40, 95% CI =0.12-1.30) or between COVID-19-positive patients who were pregnant or not pregnant (HR= 0.74, 95% CI = 0.35-1.56). Conclusions Pregnant patients do not have a greater risk of complications or death from COVID-19 than non-pregnant patients. The presence of diabetes mellitus and chronic disease increases the risk of death in women of childbearing age, but not specifically in pregnant patients.

Inflammatory bowel disease in Mexico: Epidemiology, burden of disease, and treatment trends	REVISTA DE GASTROENTEROLOGIA DE MEXICO			Spanish	Article						Inflammatory bowel disease; Crohn's disease; Ulcerative colitis; Prevalence; Registry database	CROHNS-DISEASE; PREVALENCE; COLITIS	Introduction and aims: There is no systematized information for determining/monitoring the burden of inflammatory bowel disease in Mexico. The aim of the present study was to estimate the annual burden of inflammatory bowel disease on the Mexican National Healthcare System, by number of patients seen, hospitalizations, and specific deaths, stratified into age groups. Materials and methods: Utilizing specific databases of the Mexican National Healthcare System registries coded as ICD-10: K50 and K51, we retrieved and analyzed the data corresponding to the patients seen and hospitalized in 2015, stratified by age group, as well as the specific deaths. Treatment trends among physicians were also examined. Results: In 2015, 5,009 women (8.1) and 4,944 men (8.4) with Crohn's disease received medical attention (prevalence of cases seen) and 35.1% of those patients were >= 50 years of age. In that same period, 17,177 women (27.7) and 15,883 men (26.9) with ulcerative colitis were seen and 31.6% of those patients were >= 50 years of age. The hospitalized cases (prevalence of hospitalized cases) were 1,097 patients (0.91) with Crohn's disease and 43.7% of those patients were >= 50 years of age; and 5,345 patients (4.42) with ulcerative colitis and 47.6% of those patients were >= 50 years of age. Deaths (specific mortality rate) were: 32 women (0.52) and 36 men (0.50) due to Crohn's disease, and 267 women (4.31) and 186 men (3.15) due to ulcerative colitis. Conclusions: Inflammatory bowel disease is a burden on the health of Mexican adults and the Mexican National Healthcare System, and it is expected to increase over the next 15 years.

In this sense, the countries have had difficulties in counting the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Errors in reporting results are a common factor, as well as the lack of interoperability between laboratories and governments. Approaches aimed at sending spreadsheets via email expose patients' privacy and have increased the probability of errors due to retyping, which generates a delay in the notification of results. Objective: This study aims to design and develop an interoperable platform to report polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 tests from laboratories to the Chilean government. Methods: The methodology to design and develop the interoperable platform was comprised of six well-structured stages: (1) creation of a minimum data set for PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, (2) modeling processes and end points where institutions interchange information, (3) standards and interoperability design, (4) software development, (5) software testing, and (6) software implementation. Results: The interoperable Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) platform to report PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests from laboratories to the Chilean government was successfully implemented. The platform was designed, developed, tested, and implemented following a structured methodology. The platform's performance to 1000 requests resulted in a response time of 240 milliseconds, throughput of 28.3 requests per second, and process management time of 131 milliseconds. The security was assured through a private network exclusive to the Ministry of Health to ensure confidentiality and integrity. The authorization and authentication of laboratories were implemented with a JavaScript Object Notation Web Token. All the PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests were accessible through an application programming interface gateway with valid credentials and the right access control list. Conclusions: The platform was implemented and is currently being used by UC Christus Laboratory. The platform is secure. It was tested adequately for confidentiality, secure authorization, authentication, and message integrity. This platform simplifies the reporting of PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and reduces the time and probability of mistakes in counting positive cases. The interoperable solution with FHIR is working successfully and is open for the community, laboratories, and any institution that needs to report PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests.

Methods Descriptive serial cross-sectional study based on secondary data on COVID-19 hospitalizations from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records collected by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and COVID-19 case notification data from Brasil.io, a repository of public data. Fifty-six epidemiological weeks were split into four periods. The following variables were considered for each Brazilian Health Region, per period: number of hospitalizations, hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants, hospitalizations per 100 new cases notified in the Health Region, percentage of hospitalizations with ICU use, percentages of hospitalizations with invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support, percentage of hospitalizations resulting in death and percentage of hospitalizations with ICU use resulting in death. Descriptive statistics of the variables were obtained across all 450 Health Regions in Brazil over the four defined pandemic periods. Maps were generated to capture the spatiotemporal variation and trends during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Results There was great variation in how COVID-19 hospitalizations grew and spread among Health Regions, with higher numbers between June and August 2020, and, especially, from mid-December 2020 to March 2021. The variation pattern in the proportion of ICU use in the hospitalizations across the Health Regions was broad, with no intensive care provision in large areas in the North, Northeast, and Midwest. The proportions of hospitalizations and hospitalizations with ICU use resulting in deaths were remarkably high, reaching medians of 34.0% and 62.0% across Health Regions, respectively. Conclusion The Heath Regions in Brazil are highly diverse, showing broad disparities in the capacity to respond to the demands imposed by COVID-19, services provided, use and outcomes.

M.			Evaluation of the effectiveness of surveillance policies to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Sao Paulo, Brazil	GLOBAL HEALTH RESEARCH AND POLICY			English	Article						COVID-19; Surveillance; RT-PCR public health testing policies		Background Surveillance efforts are essential to pandemic control, especially where the state is the primary health provider, such as Brazil. When public health testing guidelines limit molecular tests, there are reductions in detection efforts aimed at early recognition, isolation, and treatment of those infected with the virus. This study evaluates the effectiveness of surveillance policies to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Sao Paulo. Methods We conducted an interrupted time series analysis with a segmented regression model to analyze if changes in the state's guidelines improved RT-PCR testing outcomes in Brazil's most affluent and largest state, Sao Paulo. Anonymized daily data on the RT-PCR tests conducted in public laboratories belonging to the state-wide network from March 1, 2020 to June 5, 2021 were extracted from the Sao Paulo State open-source database, while the data on the genomic sequences were obtained from GISAID. We then aggregated these data for the 17 regional health departments in the state to evaluate regional-level outcomes. Results The public health system restricted RT-PCR testing to hospitalized cases in the first months. Testing was expanded to permit symptomatic testing of non-hospitalized persons only in July 2020, but a statistically significant increase in surveillance efforts was not observed. Case definition was expanded to allow case confirmation based on clinical, laboratory and image data criteria other than an RT-PCR test without increasing the testing effort for asymptomatic suspicious cases in September 2020. There was an increase in the mean volume of testing in each RHD, but the test positivity rate increased due to insufficient testing expansion. Results also show an uneven improvement in testing outcomes following these changes across the state's regional health departments. Conclusions Evidence suggests that lower RT-PCR testing and genomic surveillance efforts are associated with areas characterized by a higher population concentration and a greater population reliance on the public health system. Our results highlight the need to structure health surveillance and information systems for disease control and prevention in emergency settings considering local demographics and vulnerabilities. In high prevalence settings, efforts at identifying and including vulnerable populations in routine and enhanced surveillance programs during COVID-19 must be significantly improved.

Increasing impact of COVID-19 on young adults: evidence from hospitalisations in Brazil	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						COVID-19; Age structure; Rejuvenation trend; Brazil		Objectives: Concerns about the increasing impact of severe COVID-19 in younger individuals in Brazil came after a recent synchronised country-wide wave of cases in Brazil. This communication analyses how hospitalisations due to COVID-19 changed in the age groups 18-49 years and >= 70 years. Study design: Longitudinal study based on secondary data. Methods: Data from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records (including COVID-19 notifications), were used in this study. Statistical control charts examined changes in the magnitude and variation of younger (18-49 years) and older (>= 70 years) adults who were hospitalised between 15th March 2020 and 19th June 2021. Results: During the few first weeks of the pandemic in Brazil, the number of COVID-19 hospitalisations increased in older adults but decreased in younger adults. Subsequently, hospitalisations reached statistical control zones in epidemiological weeks (EW) 19-48 of 2020 (EW 19-48/2020) and EW 03-05/2021 (18-49 y, mean = 26.1%; >= 70 y, mean = 32.8%). Between EW 49/2020 and EW 02/2021, the number of hospitalisations of younger adults dropped to levels below the lower control limit. In contrast, the number of hospitalisations of older adults surpassed the upper limit of the corresponding statistical control zones. However, from EW 06/2021, numbers of hospitalisations changed from statistical control zones, with hospitalisations of younger adults increasing and reaching 44.9% in EW 24/2021 and hospitalisations of older adults decreasing until EW 19/2021 (14.1%) and reaching 17.3% in EW 24/2021. Conclusions: An increasing number of COVID-19 hospitalisations were observed in younger adults from EW 06/2021. This could be a result of the successful vaccination programme in older adults, who were initially prioritised, and possibly an increased exposure to highly transmissible variants of COVID-19 in younger adults who had to go to work in the absence of social protection (i.e. government financial support). Potential consequences of COVID-19 hospitalisations in younger adults could include a reduced life expectancy of the population and an increased number of people unable to perform daily activities due to post-COVID-19 conditions.

Methodology: Descriptive case series study using Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz/AstraZeneca Brazil and National Immunization Program/Ministry of Health (NIP/MoH) data on COVID-19 AEFI surveillance.We obtained patient-level data from pharmacovigilance for AEFI surveillance and used both the NIP/ MoH and Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz pharmacovigilance databases to create the study database. Thirty-nine cases of suspect VITT were included, 36 after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one after BNT162b2 and two after Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. All cases were based on meeting the Brighton Collaboration criteria for VITT. The primary outcomes were clinical and laboratory features, site of thrombosis, and anti-PF4 ELISA, when available.Results: Thirty-nine cases met the criteria, 38 of which were classified as level 1 and one as level 3 according to Brighton Collaboration. Most cases had the central nervous system (CNS) as the main site of thrombosis (21/39) and happened after the vaccine first dose (34/39). The median age of the cases was 41 years old (23 to 86 yo). Most of the cases (61.5%) occurred in women. The median interval between vaccination and onset of symptoms was 8 days (0-37 days). The platelet count and D-dimer count had median values of 34,000/lL and 19,235 lg FEU/L, respectively. The ELISA anti-PF4 antibody was positive in 18 samples. The overall mortality rate was 51% and was higher in cases of CNS thrombosis with intracerebral bleeding. Conclusion: Our case series shows that Brazilian VITT cases have similar clinical and laboratory profiles as demonstrated in the literature. Brazil has administered more than 300 million doses of COVID-19 vacci-nes (more than 110 million from ChAdOx1 nCoV-19). VITT seems to be a very rare but serious adverse event following COVID-19 immunization, especially adenoviral vector immunization. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The infection has been present in all the social sectors. Subjects under 18 years are one of them. The objective was to analyze the case fatality ratio of COVID-19 cases in the Mexican population under 18 years of age registered in the National Epidemiological Surveillance System from March 2020 to December 31, 2020. Material and Methods: The design is cross-sectional, quantitative, and analytical. All the suspected cases of respiratory viral disease, with a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result, aged from 0 to 17 years, were included. Descriptive statistics are presented for all the variables. Epidemiological curves were designed. The chi-squared test and its P-values were obtained to show the relationship between comorbidities and death. The case fatality ratio was computed for each comorbidity, sex, and age group. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to study the effect between comorbidities with the fatality of cases, adjusting for sex and age group as potential confounders. The alpha value was fixed to 0.05 to assess significance. Results: The number of records for this study was 167,856. Among them, 48,505 were from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (28.90%), and 119,351 (71.10%) were negative. Of those who died, males (55.29%) (P < 0.05) and those under 2 years of age (50.35%) (P < 0.05) predominated. Unlike in older populations, from the comorbidities considered risk factors for death by COVID-19, only immunosuppression showed a statistically significant effect on the fatality of cases after adjustment by the other related variables. Sex and age group were not confounders for the models in those under 18 years old. Pneumonia, being younger than 5 years, and immunosuppression are related to death. Conclusion: The case fatality ratio in those under 18 years old is low. Special attention must be paid to those children under 5 years. The development of pneumonia is a warning indicator while treating them. On the other hand, having an open database of cases allows the researchers to analyze the impact of COVID-19 in different population sectors, which has clear benefits for public health.

Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes have an increased risk for pneumonia, intensive care unit requirement, intubation, and death: A cross-sectional cohort study in Mexico in 2020	HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS			English	Article						COVID-19; diabetes mellitus; ICU; intubation; logistic regression; Mexico; mortality; pneumonia; resource allocation; retrospective cohort study; risk factors	MORTALITY; MELLITUS; SEVERITY; INFLUENZA; OUTCOMES	Background: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic health condition that has been linked with an increased risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19. In Mexico, the impact of diabetes on COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients has not been fully quantified. Understanding the increased risk posed by diabetes in this patient population can help healthcare providers better allocate resources and improve patient outcomes. Objective: The objective of this study was to quantify the extent outcomes (pneumonia, intensive care unit [ICU] stay, intubation, and death) are worsened in diabetic patients with COVID-19. Methods: Between April 14, 2020 and December 20, 2020 (last accessed), data from the open-source COVID-19 database maintained by the Mexican Federal Government were examined. Utilizing hospitalized COVID-19 patients with complete outcome data, a retrospective cohort study (N = 402,388) was carried out. In relation to COVID-19, both univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to investigate the effect of diabetes on specific outcomes. Results: The analysis included 402,388 adults (age >18) with confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 cases with mean age 46.16 (standard deviation = 15.55), 214,161 (53%) male. The outcomes delineated included pneumonia (N = 88,064; 22%), ICU requirement (N = 23,670; 6%), intubation (N = 23,670; 6%), and death (N = 55,356; 14%). After controlling for confounding variables diabetes continued to be an independent risk factor for both pneumonia (odds ratio [OR]: 1.8, confidence interval [CI]: 1.76-1.84, p < 0.01), ICU requirement (OR: 1.09, CI: 1.04-1.14, p < 0.01), intubation (OR: 1.07, CI: 1.04-1.11, p < 0.01), and death (OR: 1.88, CI: 1.84-1.93, p < 0.01) in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: According to the study, all outcomes (pneumonia, ICU requirement, intubation, and death) were greater among hospitalized individuals with diabetes and COVID-19. Additional study is required to acquire a better understanding of how diabetes affects COVID-19 outcomes and to develop practical mitigation techniques for the risk of severe sickness and complications in this particular patient population.

Several studies have been undertaken in an attempt to minimize the impact of the disease worldwide. Although new knowledge has been quickly disseminated, including viral mechanisms, pathophysiology, and clinical findings, there is a lack of information on the effective pharmacological management of this disease. In vitro studies have shown some benefits related to the use of antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. However, the data from open clinical trials on COVID-19 patients are controversial. Objective: We present the protocol for a research project that compares the potential protective effect of antimalarials in preventing moderate-to-severe forms of COVID-19 in two groups: (1) patients treated chronically with antimalarials for rheumatic diseases and (2) other members of the patients' household who have not been diagnosed with rheumatic diseases and are not taking antimalarials. Methods: This is a 24-week, prospective, observational cohort study comprising patients from public and private health services across Brazil, who chronically use antimalarials for the treatment of immune-mediated rheumatic diseases, osteoarthritis, or chikungunya-related arthropathy. A total of six sequential phone interviews were scheduled during the COVID-19 outbreak in five different regions of Brazil. Information regarding social, epidemiological, and demographic data, as well as details about rheumatic diseases, antimalarials, comorbidities, and concomitant medication, is being recorded using a specific online form in the REDCap database. Symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, including fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia, and dysgeusia, are being self-reported and collected via phone interviews. Our main outcomes are hospitalization, need of intensive care unit, and death. Results: Recruitment began at the end of March 2020, and the inclusion was done during an 8-week period (from March 29 to May 17) with a total of 10,443 individuals enrolled at baseline, 5166 of whom have rheumatic diseases, from 23 tertiary rheumatology centers across 97 Brazilian cities. Data analysis is scheduled to begin after all inclusion data have been collected. Conclusions: This study, which includes a large sample of chronic antimalarial users, will allow us to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases and long-term antimalarial usage.

This study sought to analyze the execution and implementation of installations proposed by PER-SUS, and their capacity to address the problems of radiotherapy access in Brazil. Methods From the first release (February 2015) until October 2021, all PER-SUS monthly progress reports were retrospectively analyzed. The beneficiary institutions, project location, project status, project type, dates of the progress on the stages, and reasons for cancellations or possible justifications for changing the status were collected. Brazilian geographic data, health care demands, and cancer incidences were correlated. Finally, we performed an Ishikawa diagram and 5W3H methodology, aiming to better understand the findings and to yield possible ways to improve the access to radiotherapy. Findings After ten years, the PER-SUS project delivered nearly 50% of the planned implementation of radiotherapy equipment. There was a 17% growth in the national number of linear accelerators (LINACS) with PER-SUS, against a 32% increase in cancer incidence in Brazil in the same period. The following points were identified: a high rate of beneficiary exclusions reflecting inappropriate selection or inadequate planning; delays in execution related to bureaucratic obstacles and underestimation of the requirements (logistics/people); early closing of the equipment factory as a result of lack of project prioritization by the Government. Interpretation Only about 50% of PER-SUS are being carried out. However, delays and exclusions of beneficiaries were observed. The dimension of the need for radiotherapy care in Brazil is greater than considered, and might not be fully attended by PER-SUS. Geographic, epidemiological, logistical, and economic variables could be reevaluated to allow better strategic planning and improvement proposals. PER-SUS could be optimized for the next decade, by involving all stakeholders' participation, alignment, and engagement. In the future, the States and regions with a higher LINAC shortage should be prioritized to improve RT access across the country. Considering the data and the initial project deadline, PER-SUS did not achieve the pre-established goals specified by the Brazilian Government. Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Medicinal plants used for traditional veterinary in the Sierras de Cordoba (Argentina): An ethnobotanical comparison with human medicinal uses	JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE			English	Article						ethnoveterinary; ethnomedicine; breeders; healers; pharmacopoeia; sierras de Cordoba	ETHNOVETERINARY MEDICINES; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; HEALTH; MISTLETOE; STEROIDS; PIGS	Background: This is a first description of the main ethnoveterinary features of the peasants in the Sierras de Cordoba. The aim of this study was to analyze the use of medicinal plants and other traditional therapeutic practices for healing domestic animals and cattle. Our particular goals were to: characterize veterinary ethnobotanical knowledge considering age, gender and role of the specialists; interpret the cultural features of the traditional local veterinary medicine and plant uses associated to it; compare the plants used in traditional veterinary medicine, with those used in human medicine in the same region. Methods: Fieldwork was carried out as part of an ethnobotanic regional study where 64 informants were interviewed regarding medicinal plants used in veterinary medicine throughout 2001-2010. Based participant observation and open and semi-structured interviews we obtained information on the traditional practices of diagnosis and healing, focusing on the veterinary uses given to plants (part of the plant used, method of preparation and administration). Plants speciemens were collected with the informants and their vernacular and scientific names were registered in a database. Non-parametric statistic was used to evaluate differences in medicinal plant knowledge, use, and valorization by local people. A comparison between traditional veterinary medicine and previous human medicine studies developed in the region was performed by analyzing the percentages of common species and uses, and by considering Sorensen's Similarity Index. Results: A total of 127 medicinal uses were registered, corresponding to 70 species of plants belonging to 39 botanic families. Veterinary ethnobotanical knowledge was specialized, restricted, in general, to cattle breeders (mainly men) and to a less degree to healers, and was independent of the age of the interviewees. Native plants were mostly used as skin cicatrizants, disinfectants or for treating digestive disorders. Together with a vast repertoire of plant pharmacopoeia, the therapies also involve religious or ritualistic practices and other popular remedies that evidence the influence of traditional Hispanic-European knowledge. Although the traditional veterinary knowledge seems to be similar or else is inlcuded in the local human ethnomedicine, sharing a common group of plants, it has distinct traits originated by a constant assessment of new applications specifically destined to the treatment of animals. Conclusions: Veterinary medicine is a fountain of relevant vernacular knowledge, a permanent source for testing new applications with valuable ethnobotanical interest. Knowledge on medicinal applications of native plants will allow future validations and tests for new homeopathic or phytotherapeutic preparations.

It describes a new concept: the Brazilian Public Software (BPS) developed by policy makers of the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management. The policy makers were concerned with the limitations of Free Software Model of Production (FSMP) to public administration. Efforts have been made to create an ambience where public entities could download and install software. Issues like installation and operational support, quality of software (user interfaces, manuals, etc), bugs, etc., were not effectively solved by the FSMP alone. On the other hand, the Government was also interested in creating a virtual ambience in which private entities could also open and share their software. It meant having additional intellectual property issues, brand issues, etc. Then, the policy makers of the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management shaped the new concept, the Brazilian Public Software that is based on code opening (FSMP), but includes some additional duties to the entity that makes the software available. To support and to make the concept operational an institutional, an environment was formed and so a virtual ambience named Brazilian Public Software Portal (BPSP) began to exist. Since their beginning in 2006, BPSP (www.softwarepublico.gov.br) increased their number of associates to 40,000 users and today it has 22 software solutions available, in many technological areas: geo-processing, health, public town management (sanitation, hospitals management, data management, etc) even software solutions originated from private entities that had public interest like textual database and web application server ambience. Others related portals were created like: 4CMBr, driven to municipalities; Virtual Market focused on services; 5CQualiBr centered on the quality of the software in a large sense and in the ecosystem sustainability. The 5CQualiBr is under construction and it is an outcome of the partnership with the Information Technology Center Renato Archer - CTI, from which the present article is part of. The preliminary impacts of BPS are concerned with: government software development cost reduction; reuse of software and increase of software longevity; improvement of technological apprenticeship inside the technical communities of the Government; support to small municipalities on introducing the Information and Communication Technology (ICTs) in the management process, and even introducing a digital culture where there was not anyone; creation of an ambience of collaborative software development.

However, the modifying effects of environmental degradation on climate-disease relationships have not been well explored. Here, we investigate the rapid re-emergence of malaria in a transmission hotspot in southern Venezuela and explore the synergistic effects of environmental degradation, specifically gold-mining activity, and climate variation. Methods In this spatiotemporal modelling study of the 46 parishes of the state of Bolivar, southeast Venezuela, we used data from the Venezuelan Ministry of Health including population data and monthly cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and Plasmodium vivax malaria between 1996 and 2016. We estimated mean precipitation and temperature using the ERA5-Land dataset and used monthly anomalies in sea-surface temperature as an indicator of El Nino events between 1996 and 2016. The location of suspected mining sites in Bolivar in 2009, 2017, and 2018 were sourced from the Amazon Geo-Referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network. We estimated measures of cumulative forest loss and urban development by km2 using annual land cover maps from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative between 1996 and 2016. We modelled monthly cases of P falciparum and P vivax malaria using a Bayesian hierarchical mixed model framework. We quantified the variation explained by mining activity before exploring the modifying effects of environmental degradation on climate-malaria relationships. Findings We observed a 27% reduction in the additional unexplained spatial variation in incidence of P falciparum malaria and a 23% reduction in P vivax malaria when mining was included in our models. The effect of temperature on malaria was greater in high mining areas than low mining areas, and the P falciparum malaria effect size at temperatures of 26middot5 degrees C (2middot4 cases per 1000 people [95% CI 1middot78-3middot06]) was twice as high as the effect in low mining areas (1 case per 1000 people [0middot68-1middot49]). Interpretation We show that mining activity in southern Venezuela is associated with hotspots of malaria transmission. Increased temperatures exacerbated malaria transmission in mining areas, highlighting the need to consider how environmental degradation modulates climate effect on disease risk, which is especially important in areas subjected to rapidly rising temperatures and land-use change globally. Our findings have implications for the progress towards malaria elimination in the Latin American region. Our findings are also important for effectively targeting timely treatment programmes and vector-control activities in mining areas with high rates of malaria transmission. Copyright (C) 2022.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome by SARS-CoV-2 Infection or Other Etiologic Agents Among Brazilian Indigenous Population: An Observational Study from the First Year of Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19 Pandemic	LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-AMERICAS			English	Article						COVID-19; Ethnicity; Intensive Care Unit; Indigenous; Pandemic; Race; Respiratory Disease; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Virus	LUNG ULTRASOUND FINDINGS; COVID-19; NASOPHARYNGEAL; OROPHARYNGEAL; PEOPLES; SWABS	Background Indigenous peoples are vulnerable to pandemics, including to the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, since it causes high mortality and specially, the loss of elderly Indigenous individuals. Methods The epidemiological data of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV-2 infection or other etiologic agents (OEA) among Brazilian Indigenous peoples during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from a Brazilian Ministry of Health open-access database to perform an observational study. Considering only Indigenous individuals diagnosed with SARS by COVID-19, the epidemiology data were also evaluated as risk of death. The type of sample collection for virus screening, demographic profile, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical evolution were evaluated. The primary outcome was considered the death in the Brazilian Indigenous individuals and the secondary outcome, the characteristics of Brazilian Indigenous infected by SARS-CoV-2 or OEA, as the need for intensive care unit admission or the need for mechanical ventilation support. The statistical analysis was done using Logistic Regression Model. Alpha of 0.05. Findings A total of 3,122 cases of Indigenous individuals with SARS in Brazil were reported during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these, 1,994 were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 730/1,816 (40.2%) of them died. The death rate among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 was three-fold increased when compared to the group of individuals with OEA. Several symptoms (myalgia, loss of smell, and sore throat) and comorbidities (cardiopathy, systemic arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) were more prevalent in the COVID-19 group when compared to Indigenous individuals with OEA. Similar profile was observed considering the risk of death among the Indigenous individuals with COVID-19 who presented several symptoms (oxygen saturation < 95%, dyspnea, and respiratory distress) and comorbidities (renal disorders, cardiopathy, and diabetes mellitus). The multivariate analysis was significant in differentiating between the COVID-19-positive and non-COVID-19 patients [X-2 ((7))=65.187; P-value< 0.001]. Among the patients' features, the following contributed in relation to the diagnosis of COVID-19: age [>= 43 years-old [y.o.]; OR=1.984 (95%CI=1.480-2.658)]; loss of smell [OR=2.373 (95%CI=1.461-3.854)]; presence of previous respiratory disorders [OR=0.487; 95%CI=0.287-0.824)]; and fever [OR=1.445 (95%CI=1.082-1.929)]. Also, the multivariate analysis was able to predict the risk of death [X-2 ((9))=293.694; P-value< 0.001]. Among the patients' features, the following contributed in relation to the risk of death: male gender [OR=1.507 (95%CI=1.010-2.250)]; age [>= 60 y.o.; OR=3.377 (95%CI=2.292-4.974)]; the need for ventilatory support [invasive mechanical ventilation; OR=24.050 (95%CI=12.584-45.962) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation; OR=2.249 (95%CI=1.378-3.671)]; dyspnea [OR=2.053 (95%CI=1.196-3.522)]; oxygen saturation <95% [OR=1.691 (95%CI=1.050-2.723)]; myalgia [OR=0.423 (95%CI=0.191-0.937)]; and the presence of kidney disorders [OR=3.135 (95%CI=1.144-8.539)]. Interpretation The Brazilian Indigenous peoples are in a vulnerable situation during the COVID-19 pandemic and presented an increased risk of death due to COVID-19. Several factors were associated with enhanced risk of death, as male sex, older age (>= 60 y.o.), and need for ventilatory support; also, other factors might help to differentiate SARS by COVID-19 or by OEA, as older age (>= 43 y.o.), loss of smell, and fever.

L.			Common values in assessing health outcomes from disease and injury: disability weights measurement study for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010	LANCET			English	Article							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PERSON TRADE-OFFS; STATE PREFERENCES; POPULATION; VALUATION; COMMUNITY; US; COMPARABILITY; METHODOLOGY; INFECTION	Background Measurement of the global burden of disease with disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) requires disability weights that quantify health losses for all non-fatal consequences of disease and injury. There has been extensive debate about a range of conceptual and methodological issues concerning the definition and measurement of these weights. Our primary objective was a comprehensive re-estimation of disability weights for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 through a large-scale empirical investigation in which judgments about health losses associated with many causes of disease and injury were elicited from the general public in diverse communities through a new, standardised approach. Methods We surveyed respondents in two ways: household surveys of adults aged 18 years or older (face-to-face interviews in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Peru, and Tanzania; telephone interviews in the USA) between Oct 28, 2009, and June 23, 2010; and an open-access web-based survey between July 26, 2010, and May 16, 2011. The surveys used paired comparison questions, in which respondents considered two hypothetical individuals with different, randomly selected health states and indicated which person they regarded as healthier. The web survey added questions about population health equivalence, which compared the overall health benefits of different life-saving or disease-prevention programmes. We analysed paired comparison responses with probit regression analysis on all 220 unique states in the study. We used results from the population health equivalence responses to anchor the results from the paired comparisons on the disability weight scale from 0 (implying no loss of health) to 1 (implying a health loss equivalent to death). Additionally, we compared new disability weights with those used in WHO's most recent update of the Global Burden of Disease Study for 2004. Findings 13 902 individuals participated in household surveys and 16 328 in the web survey. Analysis of paired comparison responses indicated a high degree of consistency across surveys: correlations between individual survey results and results from analysis of the pooled dataset were 0.9 or higher in all surveys except in Bangladesh (r=0.75). Most of the 220 disability weights were located on the mild end of the severity scale, with 58 (26%) having weights below 0.05. Five (11%) states had weights below 0.01, such as mild anaemia, mild hearing or vision loss, and secondary infertility. The health states with the highest disability weights were acute schizophrenia (0.76) and severe multiple sclerosis (0.71). We identified a broad pattern of agreement between the old and new weights (r=0.70), particularly in the moderate-to-severe range. However, in the mild range below 0.2, many states had significantly lower weights in our study than previously. Interpretation This study represents the most extensive empirical effort as yet to measure disability weights. By contrast with the popular hypothesis that disability assessments vary widely across samples with different cultural environments, we have reported strong evidence of highly consistent results.

GBD 2016 Causes Death Collaborato	Global, regional, and national age-sex specific mortality for 264 causes of death, 1980-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016	LANCET			English	Article							PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; INCOME COUNTRIES; ALCOHOL POLICY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; QUALITY; AFRICA; RUSSIA	Background Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. Findings The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72.3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71.2-73.2) of deaths in 2016 with 19.3% (18.5-20.4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8.43% (8.00-8.67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16-age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1.80 million deaths (95% UI 1.59 million to 1.89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2.89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1.59%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. Interpretation The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

HTLV-1-associated diseases, adult T-cell leukemia /lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraperesis (HAM/TSP), as well as frequent coinfections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Strongyloides stercoralis were associated to increased morbidity and mortality of HTLV-1 infection. Objective: To determine the mortality rate and its associated variables from an open cohort started in July 1997 at the HTLV Clinic, Emilio Ribas Institute (IIER), a major infectious disease hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Since inception up to September 2018, we admitted 727 HTLV-1-infected individuals, with a rate of 30-50 new admissions per year. All patient data, including clinical and laboratory data, were regularly updated throughout the 21-year period, using a dedicated REDCap database. The Ethical Board of IIER approved the protocol. Results: During 21 years of clinical care to people living with HTLV-1 in the Sao Paulo region, we recruited 479 asymptomatic HTLV-1-infected individuals and 248 HAM/TSP patients, of which 632 remained under active follow-up. During a total of 3800 person-years of follow-up (maximum follow-up 21.5 years, mean follow-up 6.0 years), 27 individuals died (median age of 51.5 years), of which 12 were asymptomatic, one ATLL patient and 14 HAM/TSP patients. HAM/TSP diagnosis (but neither age nor gender) was a significant predictor of increased mortality by univariate and multivariate (hazard ratio (HR) 5.03, 95% CI [1.96-12.91], p = 0.001) Cox regression models. Coinfection with HIV/HCV was an independent predictor of increased mortality (HR 15.08; 95% CI [5.50-41.32]; p < 0.001), with AIDS-related infections as a more frequent cause of death in asymptomatics (6/13; p = 0.033). HIV/HCV-negative fatal HAM/TSP cases were all female, with urinary tract infection and decubitus ulcer-associated sepsis as the main cause of death (8/14, p = 0.002). Conclusions: All-cause mortality among people living with HTLV-1 in Sao Paulo differs between asymptomatic (2.9%) and HAM/TSP patients (7.3%), independent of age and gender. We observe a dichotomy in fatal cases, with HAM/TSP and HIV/HCV coinfection as independent risk factors for death. Our findings reveal an urgent need for public health actions, as the major causes of death, infections secondary to decubitus ulcers, and immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related infections, can be targeted by preventive measures.

SAITE STORE 2.0: EXPERIENCE REPORT ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VIRTUAL LIBRARY'S NEW VERSION	EDULEARN18: 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES	EDULEARN Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)	JUL 02-04, 2018	Palma, SPAIN			Distance education; virtual library; e-learning; mobile devices		Mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones, have continuously modified people's habits and relationships in various areas of their lives. Currently, the ease of access to these devices has caused a growing number of people to have one or more devices and know how to handle them. The relationship between mobile technologies and education is growing in the teaching-learning scenario. Therefore, mobile learning becomes a reality, allowing access to educational content and knowledge sharing with autonomy, regardless of economic, social and geographical factors, through mobile interaction platforms. In this context, institutions that work with Distance Education (DE) need to update and adapt their processes to these innovations. Considering this trend, Saite Group has built, in partnership with the Open University of Brazilian National Health System (UNA-SUS) associated with the Federal University of Maranhao (UFMA), a virtual library that enables fast and free access to its contents using mobile devices: Saite Store. This tool enables the dissemination of knowledge with quality. Its content is mostly aimed at health professionals, since the training of workers in this area imposes the need for permanent qualification and innovation of educational practices, in a dynamic and systematized way. Currently, Saite Store already has more than 200 e-books distributed in 12 thematic areas. It is used by more than 21,860 users, proving to be useful in the democratization of the contents offered by UNA-SUS/UFMA. With the expansion of the tool's use, the institution invested in a new version to provide a better experience to its users. A new database architecture has been implemented for the server environment and the user's mobile device. With the operation of this data structure, the use of the offline application was allowed, since a mirror of the service is provisioned at the client. In addition to the change in navigability, the new Saite Store also has a greater capacity of books storage than the previous version, mainly because of the improvement in the application's speed. The new version has optimization algorithm for data provision and only once a day a mirror of the data that the application needs is generated. Two algorithms are used on the server: one to create a file with all available information and another only for new information. Another interesting change is that the new Saite Store brings a more flexible design than the previous one and now the student has a tool more compatible and adaptable to different devices. It was sought to understand how the user uses his device and then a version that is better suited to reading was built - be it horizontal for tablets or vertical for smartphones. Specific versions were also developed for smartphones, adapted to the guidelines of each of the operating systems (iOS, Android, and Windows). According to the Google publisher (Play Store), the application's acceptance in approved devices has reached 100%. In this paper, we dealt with the details of the version for Android devices. This paper aims to perform a detailing of the Saite Store new version, showing its operation and the technological implementations carried out. Finally, the importance of performing updates in the application is highlighted, considering its great potential for use by more than twenty thousand users.	[Figueiredo de Oliveira, A.
