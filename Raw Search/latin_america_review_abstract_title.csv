"Data analysis of breast cancer and mammography: Data on population, gross domestic product (GDP), number of mammograms performed under the Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) public health system or private system, and women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer from 2010 to 2019 were retrieved from publicly available databases. They are not generating a new dataset",Yes,"Background Mammographic screening has been used to reduce breast cancer mortality worldwide and remains the main modality for the early detection of this disease. Women from low and middle-income countries still lack access to periodic mammograms and efficient health care. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore opportunistic mammographic coverage in Brazil, while considering the privately insured population and its association with early breast cancer (EBC) detection. Methods Data on population, gross domestic product (GDP), number of mammograms performed under the Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) public health system or private system, and women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer from 2010 to 2019 were retrieved from publicly available databases. Results A total of 39 555 636 mammograms with an average of 3 955 564 ± 395 704 mammograms were obtained per year from 2010 to 2019 in Brazil. Most examinations (58.6%) were performed in the target population (50-69 years old), while 32% were performed in women aged 40-49, and 9.4% were performed in women <40 years or >70 years of age. The 10-year mammogram coverage was 30.6% in the target population and 24.8% in the population aged 40-49 years, with significant variation across states and municipalities. The overall EBC detection rates in Brazil were 30.6% in populations aged 50-70 and 24.8% in those aged 40-50 years. We observed a positive correlation between coverage and EBC detection rate (r = 0.68; P = 0.0001 (50-70 years) and r = 0.75; P < 0.0001 (40-50 years)). According to the GDP, the municipalities with higher GDP per capita had higher mammogram coverage (P < 0.0001). Conclusions The coverage of mammographic screening for women under the SUS is far below the international guidelines. Additionally, a significant number of mammograms have been performed in non-target populations. This scenario reflects the problematic screening programs in developing countries and reflects low rates of EBC diagnosis. As Brazil is a continental country with heterogeneous socioeconomic indicators, we observed significant variations in the number of mammograms performed by age groups when separated by states and municipalities. Even when considering supplemental health system coverage, municipalities with higher GDP per capita were associated with higher mammogram coverage. © 2022 The Author(s) JoGH 2022 ISoGH",10-year opportunistic mammographic screening scenario in Brazil and its impact on breast cancer early detection: a nationwide population-based study,"Cuoghi I.C., da Silva Soares M.F., dos Santos G.M.C., Candido-dos-Reis F.J., Poli-Neto O.B., de Andrade J.M., Bosquesi P.L., Orlandini L.F., Tiezzi D.G.",2022,Journal of Global Health,12,,4061,,,,1,10.7189/jogh.12.04061,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139880822&doi=10.7189%2fjogh.12.04061&partnerID=40&md5=55ff568f30ae92b999879fab516f6416,"CEPAM – Centro de Pesquisa Avançada em Medicina da UNILAGO, Faculdade de Medicina UNILAGO, União das Faculdades dos Grandes Lagos, São Paulo, São José do Rio Preto, Brazil; Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto FMRP – USP, São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil; Laboratory for Translational Data Science - University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas UNESP, São Paulo, Araraquara, Brazil","Cuoghi, I.C., CEPAM – Centro de Pesquisa Avançada em Medicina da UNILAGO, Faculdade de Medicina UNILAGO, União das Faculdades dos Grandes Lagos, São Paulo, São José do Rio Preto, Brazil; da Silva Soares, M.F., CEPAM – Centro de Pesquisa Avançada em Medicina da UNILAGO, Faculdade de Medicina UNILAGO, União das Faculdades dos Grandes Lagos, São Paulo, São José do Rio Preto, Brazil; dos Santos, G.M.C., Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto FMRP – USP, São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil; Candido-dos-Reis, F.J., Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto FMRP – USP, São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil; Poli-Neto, O.B., Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto FMRP – USP, São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil, Laboratory for Translational Data Science - University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; de Andrade, J.M., Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto FMRP – USP, São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil; Bosquesi, P.L., CEPAM – Centro de Pesquisa Avançada em Medicina da UNILAGO, Faculdade de Medicina UNILAGO, União das Faculdades dos Grandes Lagos, São Paulo, São José do Rio Preto, Brazil, Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas UNESP, São Paulo, Araraquara, Brazil; Orlandini, L.F., Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto FMRP – USP, São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil; Tiezzi, D.G., CEPAM – Centro de Pesquisa Avançada em Medicina da UNILAGO, Faculdade de Medicina UNILAGO, União das Faculdades dos Grandes Lagos, São Paulo, São José do Rio Preto, Brazil, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto FMRP – USP, São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil, Laboratory for Translational Data Science - University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil",,adult; aged; Brazil; breast tumor; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; early cancer diagnosis; female; human; mammography; middle aged; Adult; Aged; Brazil; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Mammography; Middle Aged,adult;aged;Brazil;breast tumor;cross-sectional study;diagnostic imaging;early cancer diagnosis;female;human;mammography;middle aged;Breast Neoplasms;Cross-Sectional Studies;Early Detection of Cancer;Humans,"Tiezzi, D.G.; CEPAM – Centro de Pesquisa Avançada em Medicina da UNILAGO, São Paulo, Brazil; email: dtiezzi@usp.br",,,,,,University of Edinburgh,20472978,,,36227588,English,J.

Review,No,"Background: The Journal of Infection and Public Health published its first issue in 2008. The fact that the journal has been published uninterruptedly as well as its editorial content and the application of a peer-review process to select manuscripts, made the journal eligible to be indexed by databases such as Scopus. This study presents a general overview of the journal from 2008 until 2016 using bibliometric indicators to assess its performance. Methods: The data for this study, dating between 2008 and 2016, was extracted from Scopus database. All the information was exported in CSV format to the Sequel Pro software for data analysis. Additionally, collaboration and word co-occurrence networks were generated using VOSviewer. Results: The total number of documents published between 2008-2016 was 586, of which local authorship (Saudi Arabia) constituted a small share, accounting only for 19.3% (113 documents). Those with foreign authorship (other countries excluding Saudi Arabia) represented 80.7% (473) of the total. Furthermore, the three countries that co-author documents with researchers from Saudi Arabia are Egypt, the United States and the United Kingdom. Likewise, these three countries serve as nodes connecting researchers from other countries located in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. An analysis of the top-five journals that cited the research published revealed that that 90.2% of them belonged to the first and second quartiles confirms the quality of the research being published. Word co-occurrence analysis established a slight shift of focus in the research topics published during the last four years studied, as a new cluster was formed with terms related to ""education"", ""intervention"" and ""implementation"". Conclusion: The journal has managed, in very few years, to be considered by researchers worldwide. Furthermore, throughout the years, the journal showed an evolution in the main topics covered, providing a contemporary overview of public health.

Review,No,"Objectives: To measure Peruvian scientific production on public health in Scopus database. Methods: Bibliometric study using advanced Scopus web search engine (https://www.scopus.com/search/ form.uri?display=advanced). The inclusion criteria were the publications of articles related to public health between 1973 and 2020. The equation was used as a strategy: TITLE-ABS-CLAVE (“public health”) AND AFFILCOUNTRY (Peru) AND (EXCLUDE (PUBYEAR, 2021) OR EXCLUDE (PUBYEAR, 2020)). SCImago journal & country rank was used to determine the impact factor (h-index) and the quartile of the journals identified. The analysis included in SPSS v24.0 included years of publication, institutions, h-index, list of authors with the most publications, publication types, and journals. Results: 903 articles published by 7.5±12.5 authors were included, showing that 74.5% were original articles written mainly in English (77.7%). The publications for the year 1973 and 2019 were 3 (0.3%) and 98 (10.9%), respectively. In addition, it was shown that the most productive institutions were the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (42.9%) and the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (13.1%). The journal with the highest number of Peruvian publications was Revista Peruana de Medicina Experimental y Salud Pública (RPMESP) [Peruvian Journal of Experimental Medicine and Public Health (PJEMPH)] (17.5%) and PLoS ONE (2.88%). Conclusions: The present study showed in the magazines with the highest number of citations and therefore greater visualization, where Peruvian publications in this area were published, with this the future readers can take these magazines into consideration so that their publications have a greater visualization. In addition to this, the study shows the largest institutions that have a great impact on Peruvian publications in public health in Scopus, this invites researchers to analyze the research methodologies that these institutions follow in order to disclose them for reproduction in new entities interested in research. © 2023 by Author/s and Licensed by Modestum.",A bibliometric analysis of 47-years of research on public health in Peru,"Sevillano-Jimenez J., Carrion-Chambilla M., Espinoza-Lecca E., Mori-Quispe E., Contreras-Pulache H., Moya-Salazar J.",2023,Electronic Journal of General Medicine,20,4,em488,,,,0,10.29333/ejgm/13103,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152736068&doi=10.29333%2fejgm%2f13103&partnerID=40&md5=8f6bcc7a6d5ead2f52fa4bf8ead947b1,"School of Medicine, Faculties of Health Science, Universidad Privada Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru; National Educational Scholarship and Credit Program (PRONABEC), Ministry of Education, Lima, Peru; Analitik-Research and Consulting, Lima, Peru; South American Center for Education and public health, Universidad Nobert Wiener, Lima, Peru; School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Lima, Peru","Sevillano-Jimenez, J., School of Medicine, Faculties of Health Science, Universidad Privada Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru; Carrión-Chambilla, M., School of Medicine, Faculties of Health Science, Universidad Privada Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru; Espinoza-Lecca, E., National Educational Scholarship and Credit Program (PRONABEC), Ministry of Education, Lima, Peru; Mori-Quispe, E., Analitik-Research and Consulting, Lima, Peru; Contreras-Pulache, H., South American Center for Education and public health, Universidad Nobert Wiener, Lima, Peru; Moya-Salazar, J., South American Center for Education and public health, Universidad Nobert Wiener, Lima, Peru, School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Lima, Peru",bibliometric; Peru; Peruvian research; public health; Scopus,Article; bibliometrics; experimental medicine; human; open access publishing; Peru; Peruvian; public health; publication; scientific literature; Scopus; tuberculosis,bibliometric;Peru;Peruvian research;public health;Scopus;Article;bibliometrics;experimental medicine;human;open access publishing;Peruvian;publication;scientific literature;tuberculosis,"Moya-Salazar, J.; South American Center for Education and public health, Peru; email: jeel.moya.s@upch.pe",,,,,,Modestum LTD,25163507,,,,English,Electro.

"Analysis of transplants in Argentina. Using open datasets from CRESI-SINTRA (the Argentinian database of the National Procurement Organization, an equivalent to the United Network for Organ Sharing)",Yes,"Background: The number of transplants performed relies, partially, on recipients' variables on the waiting list. The goal of this study was to compare recipients from a high-volume liver center in Argentina with the rest of the country. Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of liver transplant recipients nationally between January 2013 and April 2017. It involved extracting data from the open database CRESI-SINTRA (the Argentinian database of the National Procurement Organization, an equivalent to the United Network for Organ Sharing); expressing results by percentages, medians, and interquartile ranges (IQRs); and comparing the national population with the population transplanted at Hospital El Cruce (HEC). The Mann-Whitney U test was used for analysis. Results: Nationally, 1434 liver transplants were performed. A total of 177 (12.34%) were emergency status; 811 (56.6%) were by the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) (n = 759)/PELD (Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease) (n = 52), with a median graft assignment position of 5 (IQR, 3–10) in 57.2 days (IQR, 11–217). Median MELD access was 29 points (IQR, 24–33). A total of 446 (31.1%) had MELD exceptions; 249 (55.8%) of these were due to Milan hepatocellular carcinoma. At the HEC, 167 liver transplantations were performed; 26 (15.6%) were emergency status and 97 (58.1%) by MELD (none PELD). Their median graft assignment position was 4 (IQR, 4–16) in 19.1 days (IQR, 4–90); median MELD access was 28 points (IQR, 24–31). Forty-five patients (26.9%) had MELD exceptions; 31 (68.9%) were due to hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusions: Our center has a larger proportion of recipients transplanted by emergency status and MELD, similar MELD access, and less waiting list time, reflecting our wide policy of liver graft acceptance. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Access to Grafts in a Liver Transplant Center: Does It Rely on the Severity of the Waiting List Population?,"Daciuk N.I., Quinonez E.G., Poupard M., Vergara Sandoval R.M., Mattera F.J.",2018,Transplantation Proceedings,50,2,,387,390,,0,10.1016/j.transproceed.2017.12.049,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044141657&doi=10.1016%2fj.transproceed.2017.12.049&partnerID=40&md5=ad43530764085e0a4c696e6970fec61a,"Liver Transplant Unit, Hospital El Cruce, Florencio Varela, Argentina","Daciuk, N.I., Liver Transplant Unit, Hospital El Cruce, Florencio Varela, Argentina; Quiñonez, E.G., Liver Transplant Unit, Hospital El Cruce, Florencio Varela, Argentina; Poupard, M., Liver Transplant Unit, Hospital El Cruce, Florencio Varela, Argentina; Vergara Sandoval, R.M., Liver Transplant Unit, Hospital El Cruce, Florencio Varela, Argentina; Mattera, F.J., Liver Transplant Unit, Hospital El Cruce, Florencio Varela, Argentina",,adult; Argentina; Article; child; comparative study; controlled study; digestive system disease assessment; emergency care; groups by age; health care access; health care facility; hospital admission; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver graft; liver transplant center; liver transplantation; major clinical study; Model For End Stage Liver Disease Score; Pediatric End Stage Liver Disease; priority journal; retrospective study; end stage liver disease; female; hospital admission; liver transplantation; male; middle aged; severity of illness index; statistics and numerical data; Argentina; End Stage Liver Disease; Female; Humans; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Waiting Lists,adult;Argentina;Article;child;comparative study;controlled study;digestive system disease assessment;emergency care;groups by age;health care access;health care facility;hospital admission;human;liver cell carcinoma;liver graft;liver transplant center;liver transplantation;major clinical study;Model For End Stage Liver Disease Score;Pediatric End Stage Liver Disease;priority journal;retrospective study;end stage liver disease;female;male;middle aged;severity of illness index;statistics and numerical data;Humans;Retrospective Studies;Waiting Lists,"Daciuk, N.I.; Liver Transplant Unit, Av Calchaqui 5401 Florencio Varela (1888), Argentina; email: n_daciuk@yahoo.com.ar",,,,,,Elsevier USA,411345,,TRPPA,29579809,English,Transplant.

Review,No,"Introduction: Unrestricted access to journal publications speeds research progress, productivity, and knowledge translation, which in turn develops and promotes the efficient dissemination of content. We describe access to the 500 most-cited emergency medicine (EM) articles (published between 2012 and 2016) in terms of publisher-based access (open access or subscription), alternate access routes (self-archived or author provided), and relative cost of access. Methods: We used the Scopus database to identify the 500 most-cited EM articles published between 2012 and 2016. Access status was collected from the journal publisher. For studies not available via open access, we searched on Google, Google Scholar, Researchgate, Academia.edu, and the Unpaywall and Open Access Button browser plugins to locate self-archived copies. We contacted corresponding authors of the remaining inaccessible studies for a copy of each of their articles. We collected article processing and access costs from the journal publishers, and then calculated relative cost differences using the World Bank purchasing power parity index for the United States (U.S.), Germany, Turkey, China, Brazil, South Africa, and Australia. This allows costs to be understood relative to the economic context of the countries from which they originated. Results: We identified 500 articles for inclusion in the study. Of these, 167 (33%) were published in an open access format. Of the remaining 333 (67%), 204 (61%) were available elsewhere on the internet, 18 (4%) were provided by the authors, and 111 (22%) were accessible by subscription only. The mean article processing and access charges were $2,518.62 and $44.78, respectively. These costs were 2.24, 1.75, 2.28 and 1.56 times more expensive for South African, Chinese, Turkish, and Brazilian authors, respectively, than for U.S. authors (p<0.001 all). Conclusion: Despite the advantage of open access publication for knowledge translation, social responsibility, and increased citation, one in five of the 500 EM articles were accessible only via subscription. Access for scientists from upper-middle income countries was significantly hampered by cost. It is important to acknowledge the value this has for authors from low- and middle-income countries. Authors should also consider the citation advantage afforded by open access publishing when deciding where to publish. © 2019 Al Hamzy et al.",Access to top-cited emergency care articles (published between 2012 and 2016) without subscription,"Hamzy M.A., de Villiers D., Banner M., Lamprecht H., Bruijns S.R.",2019,Western Journal of Emergency Medicine,20,3,,460,465,,1,10.5811/westjem.2019.2.40957,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066853321&doi=10.5811%2fwestjem.2019.2.40957&partnerID=40&md5=4556e4d8e8c0119a8515037d0b983e28,"Stellenbosch University, Division of Emergency Medicine, Cape Town, South Africa; University of Cape Town, Division of Emergency Medicine, Cape Town, South Africa","Hamzy, M.A., Stellenbosch University, Division of Emergency Medicine, Cape Town, South Africa; de Villiers, D., University of Cape Town, Division of Emergency Medicine, Cape Town, South Africa; Banner, M., University of Cape Town, Division of Emergency Medicine, Cape Town, South Africa; Lamprecht, H., Stellenbosch University, Division of Emergency Medicine, Cape Town, South Africa; Bruijns, S.R., University of Cape Town, Division of Emergency Medicine, Cape Town, South Africa",,"article; Australia; Brazil; China; emergency care; emergency medicine; Germany; human; Internet; middle income country; open access publishing; parity; publication; purchasing; scientist; Scopus; social responsibility; South Africa; systematic review; Turkey (republic); World Bank; access to information; economics; emergency health service; emergency medicine; factual database; journal impact factor; publication; Access to Information; Databases, Factual; Emergency Medical Services; Emergency Medicine; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Open Access Publishing; Periodicals as Topic; South Africa","article;Australia;Brazil;China;emergency care;emergency medicine;Germany;human;Internet;middle income country;open access publishing;parity;publication;purchasing;scientist;Scopus;social responsibility;South Africa;systematic review;Turkey (republic);World Bank;access to information;economics;emergency health service;factual database;journal impact factor;Databases, Factual;Emergency Medical Services;Humans;Periodicals as Topic","Bruijns, S.R.; University of Cape Town, F51-62 Old Main Building, South Africa; email: stevan.bruijns@uct.ac.za",,,,,,eScholarship,1936900X,,,31123546,English,West.

"Predictive autoregressive model of covid: Data Source: Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU.CSSE) and the World Bank's public dataset for Global Health, and OpenStreetMap. The collected publicly available datasets includes newly diagnosed infections per day, existing confirmed infections, number of people recovered, and deaths. There is not even a brazilian author in the paper. They are not generating a new dataset",Yes,"Different countries have adopted various control measures for the COVID-19 pandemic in different periods, and as the virus continues to mutate, the progression of the pandemic and preventive measures adopted have varied dynamically over time. Thus, quantitative analysis of the dynamic impact of different factors such as vaccination, mutant virus, social isolation, etc., on transmission and predicting pandemic progress has become a difficult task. To overcome the challenges above and enable governments to formulate reasonable countermeasures against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we integrate several mathematical methods and propose a new adaptive multifactorial and geographically diverse epidemiological model based on a modified version of the classical susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model. Based on public datasets, a multi-center study was carried out considering 21 regions. First, a retrospective study was conducted to predict the number of infections over the next 30 days in 13 representative pandemic areas worldwide with an accuracy of 87.53%, confirming the robustness of the proposed model. Second, the impact of three scenarios on COVID-19 was quantified based on the scalability of the model: two different vaccination regimens were analyzed, and it was found that the number of infections would progressively decrease over time after vaccination; variant virus caused a 301.55% increase in infections in the United Kingdom; and 3-tier social lockdown in the United Kingdom reduced the infections by 47.01%. Third, we made short-term prospective predictions for the next 15 and 30 days for six countries with severe COVID-19 transmission and the predicted trend is accurate. This study is expected to inform public health responses. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/yuanyuanpei7/covid-19.

They generated their own dataset and is public now!,No,"The Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ) was applied to assess the motivations for daily food choices and associated factors in a Brazilian sample. Data were collected from January to July 2019 from 525 individuals over 18 years old recruited face-to-face in different places (e.g., university, public squares, health posts), using a convenient, intentional, and reasoned sampling. In addition to the FCQ, socioeconomic data were collected from printed questionnaires. Answers were given using a seven-point scale, ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree. After Confirmatory factor analysis led to the rejection of the original FCQ structure, exploratory factor analysis was performed. Eight factors were extracted and named: nutritional composition, mood, health, sensory appeal, price, preparation convenience, familiarity, and purchase convenience. Other analyses were performed and led to a previously published discussion about food choice criteria hierarchy and associated factors. Researchers and practitioners can further use data from this survey in science and practice. These data can be useful for product development, nutritional counseling, and public health policies development.

Covid forecast: Dataset: Open covid-19 data set sourced by the Health Ministry of Peru (MINSA),Yes,"The current spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had put all the scientific community in alert. Even in the presence of different vaccines, the active virus still represents a global challenge. Due to its rapid spreading and uncertain nature, having the ability to forecast its dynamics becomes a necessary tool in the development of fast and efficient health policies. This study implements a temporal convolutional neural network (TCN), trained with the open covid-19 data set sourced by the Health Ministry of Peru (MINSA) on the Peruvian coast. In order to obtain a robust model, the data was divided into validation and training sets, without overlapping. Using the validation set the model architecture and hyper-parameters were found with Bayesian optimization. Using the optimal configuration the TCN was trained with a test and forecasting window of 15 days ahead. Predictions on available data were made from March 06, 2020 until April 13, 2021, whereas forecasting from April 14 to April 29, 2021. In order to account for uncertainty, the TCN estimated the 5%, 50% and 95% prediction quantiles. Evaluation was made using the MAE, MAD, MSLE, RMSLE and PICP metrics. Results suggested some variations in the data distribution. Test results shown an improvement of 24.241, 0.704 and 0.422 for the MAD, MSLE and RMSLE metrics respectively. Finally, the prediction interval analysis shown an average of 97.886% and 97.778% obtained by the model in the train and test partitions.",A Deep Learning Approach to Forecast SARS-CoV-2 on the Peruvian Coast,"Aguilar, I.L., Ibanez-Reluz, M., Aguilar, J.C.Z., Zavaleta-Aguilar, E.W., Aguilar, L.A.",2021,"COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS, ICCSA 2021, PT III",12951,,,304,319,16,0,10.1007/978-3-030-86970-0_22,,"[Luis Aguilar, I] Natl Univ Piura, Dept Math, Castilla S-N, Piura, Peru; [Ibanez-Reluz, Miguel] Cesar Vallejo Univ, Med Fac, Av Victor Larco 1770, Trujillo, Peru; [Aguilar, Juan C.

I don't know the relevance in health. They used developmental pressures (from the DOPA database) and Wikipedia to measure political vulnerability in Protected areas,No,"Protected areas (PAs) are often seen as opportunity costs and are therefore vulnerable to political decisions that open them up to public or private development initiatives. We reasoned that, ceteris paribus, PAs with high levels of public support should be more resilient to such decisions because; i) politicians in democratic societies are reluctant to make unpopular/controversial decisions that go against public opinion, and; ii) the proposed development of popular PAs is more likely to be met by vigorous resistance ('push-back') from NGOs and other societal actors. Nevertheless, public interest and, by extension, support for protected areas has rarely been considered in PA risk assessments. Here, we propose an innovative approach to assessing the political vulnerability of PAs that combines indices of developmental pressures (from the DOPA database) with an innovative culturomic-derived metric of public interest based on Wikipedia page views. Using automated methods, we quantify the political vulnerability status of 523 Brazilian PAs. Our analysis reveals a large number of PAs that may be politically vulnerable, being characterized by a combination of high developmental pressure and low/very low levels of public interest. For such PAs, we recommend managers take measures to increase public interest to ensure a healthy base of public support in the future. We conclude that digital metrics of public interest are simply and inexpensively generated, and could be easily incorporated into the existing assessment systems for protected areas.",A digital approach to quantifying political vulnerability of protected areas,"Guedes-Santos, J., Correia, R.A., Malhado, A.C.M., Ladle, R.J.",2021,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY,124,,,616,626,11,1,10.1016/j.envsci.2021.08.005,,"[Guedes-Santos, Jhonatan; Mendes Malhado, Ana Claudia; Ladle, Richard James] Univ Fed Alagoas, Inst Biol & Hlth Sci, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil; [Correia, Ricardo Aleixo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki Lab Interdisciplinary Conservat Sci HELI, Helsinki, Finland; [Correia, Ricardo Aleixo] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, Helsinki, Finland; [Correia, Ricardo Aleixo] Univ Aveiro, DBIO, Campus Univ Santiago, Aveiro, Portugal; [Correia, Ricardo Aleixo] Univ Aveiro, CESAM Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, Campus Univ Santiago, Aveiro, Portugal; [Ladle, Richard James] Univ Porto, CIBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Vairao, Portugal",,Culturomics; Wikipedia; Public interest; Digital data; Public engagement; Protected areas,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION; DEGAZETTEMENT PADDD; POPULARITY,Culturomics;Wikipedia;Public interest;Digital data;Public engagement;Protected areas;BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION;AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION;DEGAZETTEMENT PADDD;POPULARITY,jhonguedes@gmail.com,,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,1462-9011,,,,English,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Article,WoS,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000691795600004,2-s2.0-85112743653,Brazil;Finland;Portugal,gmail.com,Univ Fed Alagoas;Univ Helsinki;Univ Aveiro;Univ Porto,"Univ Fed Alagoas, Brazil;Univ Helsinki, Finland;Univ Aveiro, Portugal;Univ Porto, Portugal","Guedes-Santos, Jhonatan; Correia, Ricardo Aleixo; Mendes Malhado, Ana Claudia; Ladle, Richard James",,
Predictive autoregressive model of covid: They used covid 19 data from Johns Hopkins University.,Yes,"Here we present a discrete-time-evolution model with one day interval to forecast the propagation of Covid-19. The proposed model can be easily implemented with daily updated data sets of the pandemic publicly available by distinct online sources. It has only two adjustable parameters and it predicts the evolution of the total number of infected people in a country for the next 14 days if parameters do not change during the analyzed period. The model incorporates the main aspects of the disease such as the fact that there are asymptomatic and symptomatic phases (both capable of propagating the virus), and that these phases take almost two weeks before the infected person status evolves to the next (asymptomatic becomes symptomatic or symptomatic becomes either recovered or dead). A striking advantage of the model for its implementation by the health sector is that it gives directly the number of total infected people in each day (in thousands, tens of thousands or hundred of thousands). Here, the model is tested with data from Brazil, UK and South Korea, presenting low error rates on the prediction of the evolution of the disease in all analyzed countries. We hope this model may be a useful tool to estimate the propagation of the disease. © 2020 Curado, Curado.

Objective To identify the ADRs associated with the use of biological drugs in Colombia. Methods This was a retrospective study of ADR reports from 2014 to 2019, contained in the database of Audifarma SA pharmacovigilance program. The ADRs, groups of associated drugs, and affected organs were classified. Results In total, 5,415 reports of ADRs associated with biological drugs were identified in 78 Colombian cities. A total of 76.1% of the cases corresponded to women. The majority were classified as type A (55.0%) and B (28.9%), and 16.7% were serious cases. The respiratory tract was the most affected organ system (16.8%), followed by the skin and appendages (15.6%). Antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drugs accounted for 70.6% of the reports, and the drugs related to the greatest number of ADRs were adalimumab (12.2%) and etanercept (11.6%). Conclusions The reporting of ADRs has increased in recent years and these reactions are mostly classified as tyoe A or B, categorized as serious in almost one-fifth of the reported cases and associated mainly with immunomodulators and antineoplastic agents.

The aim of this study was to analyze new drugs registered in Brazil between 2003 and 2013 with respect to Pharmaceutical Assistance programs within the Brazilian health system and to the disease burden in the country. In our retrospective cohort study, new drugs registered in Brazil were identified through document analysis of databases and publicly available documents from National Health Surveillance Agency. The data on disease burden in Brazil was obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2012, published by the World Health Organization. The level of therapeutic innovation was determined using the Motola algorithm. Although a total of 159 new medicines were used in the cohort, only 28 (17.6%) were classified as important therapeutic innovations. There is a disproportionate relationship between the percentage of new drugs and the burden of disease, with an under-representation of drugs for infectious respiratory diseases, heart disease, and digestive diseases. Incentive strategies for research and development of medicines should be prioritized to reduce the disparity regarding the burden of disease and to help develop innovative medicines necessary to improve health throughout the country. © 2017, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

database of visual disability certificates issued by the Buenos Aires City Ministry of Health,Yes,"This study assessed the causes of visual impairment over a decade in Buenos Aires City. This is a retrospective case series where we reviewed the database of visual disability certificates issued by the Buenos Aires City Ministry of Health between 2009 and 2017. In Argentina, visual disability is defined as a visual acuity <= 20/200 in the better eye, or a corresponding visual field of less than 20 degrees in the less impaired eye. The database included the following variables: year of issue, age, gender, and cause of visual disability. Between 2009 and 2017 a total of 7656 subjects were certified as legally blind. The mean age of the sample was 57 +/- 21 years and 52.1% were females. The emission was near 700 certificates per year. The age distribution showed that 62.8% of certificates were from patients older than 50 years and that only 6.6% were given to subjects under 20. The leading causes of visual disability in Buenos Aires City were age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) with a rate of 15.5%, degenerative myopia (14.4%), primary open-angle glaucoma (11.3%) and diabetic retinopathy (6.6%). In subjects younger than 50, degenerative myopia was the first cause of visual disability.

even in the paper is not clear the data source,No,"Background Caesarean section prevalence is increasing in Asia and Latin America while remaining low in most African regions. Caesarean section delivery is effective for saving maternal and infant lives when they are provided for medically-indicated reasons. On the basis of ecological studies, caesarean delivery prevalence between 9% and 19% has been associated with better maternal and perinatal outcomes, such as reduced maternal land fetal mortality. However, the specific prevalence of obstetric and medical complications that require caesarean section have not been established, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We sought to provide information to inform the approach to the provision of caesarean section in low-resource settings. Methods We did a literature review to establish the prevalence of obstetric and medical conditions for six potentially life-saving indications for which caesarean section could reduce mortality in LMICs. We then analysed a large, prospective population-based dataset from six LMICs (Argentina, Guatemala, Kenya, India, Pakistan, and Zambia) to determine the prevalence of caesarean section by indication for each site. We considered that an acceptable number of events would be between the 25th and 75th percentile of those found in the literature. Findings Between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2013, we enrolled a total of 271 855 deliveries in six LMICs (seven research sites). Caesarean section prevalence ranged from 35% (3467 of 9813 deliveries in Argentina) to 1% (303 of 16 764 deliveries in Zambia). Argentina's and Guatemala's sites all met the minimum 25th percentile for five of six indications, whereas sites in Zambia and Kenya did not reach the minimum prevalence for caesarean section for any of the indications. Across all sites, a minimum overall caesarean section of 9% was needed to meet the prevalence of the six indications in the population studied. Interpretation In the site with high caesarean section prevalence, more than half of the procedures were not done for life-saving conditions, whereas the sites with low proportions of caesarean section (below 9%) had an insufficient number of caesarean procedures to cover those life-threatening causes. Attempts to establish a minimum caesarean prevalence should go together with focusing on the life-threatening causes for the mother and child. Simple methods should be developed to allow timely detection of life-threatening conditions, to explore actions that can remedy those conditions, and the timely transfer of women with those conditions to health centres that could provide adequate care for those conditions.

Is in agriculture,No,"The development of soybean cultivars resistant to Phakopsora pachyrhizi (also known as Asian Soybean Rust (ASR)) may be achieved through genetic breeding. In the stage of selecting the resistant genotypes, one factor that can be used is to observe visually the severity of the rust symptoms upon leaflets of sampled soybean plants. By being able to quantify the exact amounts of regions with chlorosis, necrosis, and unaffected of each sample an automatic method is developed to grade rust severity and to classify the samples accordingly. The proposed approach uses input images of soybean leaflets, in a range from healthy to different levels of ASR severity, sampled from controlled experiments in a farm in southeast Brazil. Images are then processed by channel transformation (RGB to CIELab), channel distribution analysis, and a clustering algorithm in order to segment the regions in three main areas. Those regions represent the main visual symptoms of the ASR severity, but still with ill-defined transitions between them. A post-processing superpixel algorithm is leveraged upon those results to arrive at a first rust intervals classification. A necrosis' neighborhood analysis is proposed to compute the intermediate areas and to include them in a final rust index. Results are given upon four different experiments: 1) 200 acquired image samples taken directly from the field; 2) 67 detached leaflets at different evolved periods of infection; 3) 50 images from a previous open database, and 4) 10 images with the standards for diagrammatic scales.

yellow fever and Mayaro virus vector. (To be readed to see data sources),No,"Yellow fever virus (YFV) has a long history of impacting human health in South America. Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emerging arbovirus of public health concern in the Neotropics and its full impact is yet unknown. Both YFV and MAYV are primarily maintained via a sylvatic transmission cycle but can be opportunistically transmitted to humans by the bites of infected forest dwelling Haemagogus janthinomys Dyar, 1921. To better understand the potential risk of YFV and MAYV transmission to humans, a more detailed understanding of this vector species' distribution is critical. This study compiled a comprehensive database of 177 unique Hg. janthinomys collection sites retrieved from the published literature, digitized museum specimens and publicly accessible mosquito surveillance data. Covariate analysis was performed to optimize a selection of environmental (topographic and bioclimatic) variables associated with predicting habitat suitability, and species distributions modelled across South America using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach. Our results indicate that suitable habitat for Hg. janthinomys can be found across forested regions of South America including the Atlantic forests and interior Amazon. Author summary Mayaro virus is a neglected tropical disease and there is insufficient evidence to define its geographic range. The mosquito Haemagogus janthinomys is a primary vector of Mayaro and its distribution is largely unknown at a sub-country scale. Building compendiums of collection data and creating ecological niche models provides a more precise estimation of vector species potential habitat. Our dataset stands as one of the most expansive existing for collection data of this species combining data published in literature, publicly available data repositories and digitized museum specimen records. Comparing results of niche models with near real time environmental data can give even better predictions of areas where Mayaro virus exposure could occur. The methods and results of this study can be replicated for any disease/vector of interest so long as there is data discoverable through the scientific literature, public repositories, or other civilian and governmental agencies willing to share.","An ecological niche model to predict the geographic distribution of Haemagogus janthinomys, Dyar, 1921 a yellow fever and Mayaro virus vector, in South America","Celone, M., Pecor, D.B., Potter, A., Richardson, A., Dunford, J., Pollett, S.",2022,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,16,7,e0010564,,,21,1,10.1371/journal.pntd.0010564,,"[Celone, Michael; Dunford, James] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Bethesda, MD USA; [Pecor, David Brooks; Potter, Alexander; Richardson, Alec] Walter Reed Army Inst Res, Dept Entomol, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Pecor, David Brooks; Potter, Alexander; Richardson, Alec] Walter Reed Biosystemat Unit, Suitland, MD 20746 USA; [Pollett, Simon] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med & Biostat, Infect Dis Clin Res Program, Bethesda, MD USA; [Pollett, Simon] Henry M Jackson Fdn Adv Mil Med Inc, Bethesda, MD USA",,,DIPTERA-CULICIDAE; DIFFERENT REGIONS; TEMPERATURE-FLUCTUATIONS; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; CLIMATIC FACTORS; SAMPLE-SIZE; BRAZIL; DISEASE; FOREST; EPIDEMIC,DIPTERA-CULICIDAE;DIFFERENT REGIONS;TEMPERATURE-FLUCTUATIONS;SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS;CLIMATIC FACTORS;SAMPLE-SIZE;BRAZIL;DISEASE;FOREST;EPIDEMIC,pecord@si.edu,,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",,,,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,1935-2735,,,35802748,English,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Article,WoS,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,WOS:000922468300024,2-s2.0-85134775531,United States,si.edu,Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci;Walter Reed Army Inst Res;Walter Reed Biosystemat Unit;Henry M Jackson Fdn Adv Mil Med Inc,"Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, United States;Walter Reed Army Inst Res, United States;Walter Reed Biosystemat Unit, United States;Henry M Jackson Fdn Adv Mil Med Inc, United States","Celone, Michael; Pecor, David Brooks; Potter, Alexander; Richardson, Alec; Dunford, James; Pollett, Simon",,
"The data is not open. Is at REDCap database at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto (Canada)",No,"Background: Allied health and nursing professionals (AHNP) are integral members of transplant teams. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they were required to adapt to changes in their clinical practices. The goal of the present study was to describe AHNP perceptions concerning the impact of the pandemic on their roles, practice, and resource allocation.Methods: An online survey was distributed globally via email by the International Pediatric Transplant Association to AHNP at transplant centers from September to December 2020. Responses to open-ended questions were collected using an electronic database. Using a thematic analysis approach, coding was conducted by three independent coders who identified patterns in responses, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion.Results: The majority of respondents (n = 119) were from North America (78%), with many other countries represented (e.g., the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Central and South America). Four main categories of impacts were identified: (1) workflow changes, (2) the quality of the work environment, (3) patient care, and (4) resources.Conclusions: Participants indicated that the pandemic heightened existing barriers and resource challenges frequently experienced by AHNP; however, the value of team connections and opportunities afforded by technology were also highlighted. Virtual care was seen as increasing healthcare access but concerns about the quality and consistency of care were also expressed. A notable gap in participant responses was identified; the vast majority did not identify any personal challenges connected with the pandemic (e.g., caring for children while working remotely, personal stress) which likely further impacted their experiences.",An international survey of allied health & nursing professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: Perspectives on facilitators of & barriers to care,"Piotrowski, C., Graham, A., Gold, A., Wray, J., Bannister, L., Wichart, J., Kosmach-Parks, B., Shellmer, D., Mayersohn, G., Patterson, C.",2023,PEDIATRIC TRANSPLANTATION,,,e14491,,,7,0,10.1111/petr.14491,,"[Piotrowski, Caroline] Univ Manitoba, Rady Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Graham, Ashley; Patterson, Catherine] Hosp Sick Children, Dept Rehabil Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Graham, Ashley; Bannister, Louise; Patterson, Catherine] Hosp Sick Children, Transplant & Regenerat Med Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Graham, Ashley; Gold, Anna] Univ Toronto, Dept Occupat Sci & Occupat Therapy, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Gold, Anna] Hosp Sick Children, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wray, Jo] Great Ormond St Hosp Children NHS Fdn Trust, Heart & Lung Directorate, London, England; [Wichart, Jenny] Alberta Childrens Prov Gen Hosp, Dept Pharm, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Kosmach-Parks, Beverly] UPMC Childrens Hosp Pittsburgh, Dept Transplant Surg, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Shellmer, Dianna] Univ Pittsburgh, UPMC Childrens Hosp Pittsburg, Dept Surg, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Mayersohn, Gillian] St Louis Childrens Hosp, Dept Community Hlth Sci, St Louis, MO USA",,allied health; COVID-19 impact; nursing; quality of care; solid organ transplantation,,allied health;COVID-19 impact;nursing;quality of care;solid organ transplantation,caroline.piotrowski@umanitoba.ca,,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,WILEY,1397-3142,,,36823720,English,PEDIATR TRANSPLANT,Article; Early Access,WoS,Pediatrics; Transplantation,WOS:000938053800001,2-s2.0-85149267880,Canada;United Kingdom;United States,umanitoba.ca,Univ Manitoba;Hosp Sick Children;Univ Toronto;Great Ormond St Hosp Children NHS Fdn Trust;Alberta Childrens Prov Gen Hosp;UPMC Childrens Hosp Pittsburgh;Univ Pittsburgh;St Louis Childrens Hosp,"Univ Manitoba, Canada;Hosp Sick Children, Canada;Univ Toronto, Canada;Great Ormond St Hosp Children NHS Fdn Trust, United Kingdom;Alberta Childrens Prov Gen Hosp, Canada;UPMC Childrens Hosp Pittsburgh, United States;Univ Pittsburgh, United States;St Louis Childrens Hosp, United States","Piotrowski, Caroline; Graham, Ashley; Gold, Anna; Wray, Jo; Bannister, Louise; Wichart, Jenny; Kosmach-Parks, Beverly; Shellmer, Dianna; Mayersohn, Gillian; Patterson, Catherine",,
Cancer analysis. The number of new cancer cases and deaths were extracted from the GLOBOCAN 2020 database developed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),Yes,"Background Cancer is a leading cause of disease and death in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Contemporary data on the cancer burden aims to inform effective cancer policies; this article provides an update and benchmarking of national cancer incidence and mortality estimates for the year 2020, alongside recent mortality trends in the region. Methods The number of new cancer cases and deaths were extracted from the GLOBOCAN 2020 database developed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and mortality data over time from IARC's cancer mortality database, New cancer cases, deaths and corresponding age-standardized rates per 100,000 person-years are presented. Random fluctuations in mortality trends by country, sex and cancer site were smoothed using LOWE-SS regression. Findings An estimated total of 1.5 million new cancer cases and 700,000 deaths occur annually in LAC, with corresponding incidence and mortality rates of 186.5 and 86.6 per 100,000. The most common cancers in 2020 were prostate (15%), breast (14%), colorectal (9%), lung (7%) and stomach (5%). Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death (12%), though rates varied substantially between countries. The mortality trends of infectious-related cancers tended to decline in most countries, while rates of cancer types linked to westernization were mainly increasing. Assuming rates remain unchanged, the cancer burden in LAC will increase by 67% reaching 2.4 million new cases annually by 2040. Interpretation The cancer patterns reflect important underlying sociodemographic changes occurring over the last decades. With an increasing burden anticipated over the next decades in this region, there is a need to plan oncological service provision accordingly. Copyright (c) 2022 World Health Organization.

Review,No,"There is a global movement for the democratization of access to open government data, for the free use of society. This movement should enable greater participation by society in the development of a more efficient State, with the provision of public utility services, making wide use of technologies. To make this understanding clearer, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried out, which sought to reveal strategies for the use of open data, tools and techniques of Information Visualization. In Brazil, the municipalities are inspected by the State Audit Courts, and the Sao Paulo State Court of Auditors provides an open database of more than 600 municipalities. From this open database, complemented by other data sources and performance indicators, based on SLR results, the work presented in this article shows that with the correct application of Information Visualization techniques, it facilitates the understanding of public management. The public service is an important source of data, as it contains information that can have a direct impact on each citizen's life and compromise essential services such as health, safety and education. What is intended again is to structure specialized presentations according to the user's profile.

Review,No,"Introduction Quality assessment in the context of maternal health services in Brazil has been the object of study due to maternal mortality rates that remain high in the country, in addition to the high costs of healthcare and the increased level of complexity in care. To change this situation, several strategies have been proposed to improve care for women. One of them is the improvement of women's access to maternal and child services through the Reception with Obstetric Risk Classification (ACCRO). Objective To map and synthesise scientific evidence in the literature of studies that assess the quality of ACCRO services from the perspective of users, professionals and managers, as well as map tools that assess the quality of these services and their results. Method and analysis It is a scoping protocol that follows the method recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute, other authors and guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The Population, Concept and Context strategy will systematise the search in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, LILACS, SCOPUS and Web of Science and PsycINFO databases. For the grey literature search: Google Scholar, Theses and Dissertations Bank of the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology, Federated Network of Institutional Repositories of Scientific Publications, Online Theses Electronic Service, Open Access Scientific Repository of Portugal, Academic Archive Online. Searches and application of selection criteria will be performed according to the PRISMA-ScR flow approach. The articles will be selected from the Web Rayyan platform, the results will be analysed and presented in a narrative and thematically organised way. This scoping review is expected to contribute to the feasibility of assessing the quality of ACCRO services. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required.

This is not open data,No,"Background: Malocclusions are highly prevalent in childhood and adolescence, being considered a public health problem worldwide, in addition to be considered an important predictor in the tongue position and speech disorders. Objective: Evaluate the association of malocclusions with tongue position and speech distortion in mixed-dentition schoolchildren from the south of Brazil. Methodology: This cross-sectional study was performed using a database of an epidemiological survey realized in the southern of Brazil, in 2015, for evaluating the dental and myofunctional condition of the mixed-dentition from 7-13 years' schoolchildren. The outcome variables were tongue position and speech distortion, evaluated by a trained and calibrated examiner. Characteristics regarding sociodemographic and oral health measures (Angle's classification of the malocclusion, overjet, overbite, posterior crossbite and respiratory mode) were also assessed. Poisson regression models with adjusted robust variance were used to evaluate the association among predictors variables in the outcomes. Results are presented as prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: A total of 547 children were evaluated. Schoolchildren who presented anterior open bite (PR 2.36 95%CI 1.59-3.49) and having oral/oral-nasal breathing (RP 2.51 95%CI 1.70-3.71) are more likely to have altered position of the tongue. Both deep bite and being male represent protection factors for the abnormal tongue position. Regarding speech distortion, deep overbite presents a protective relationship to speech distortion (PR 0.41; 9 5 degrees A)C1 0.24-0.71), whereas schoolchildren with posterior crossbite were more likely to present this problem (PR 1.77; 95%CI 1.09-2.88). Conclusion: Anterior open bite and posterior crossbite were the malocclusions related to speech distortion and/or altered tongue position. Oral/oral-nasal breathing was also related to myofunctional changes. Deep bite malocclusion was a protective factor for both speech problems and altered tongue position when compared to a normal overbite.","Association between malocclusion, tongue position and speech distortion in mixed-dentition schoolchildren: an epidemiological study","Assaf, D.D., Knorst, J.K., Busanello-Stella, A.R., Ferrazzo, V.A., Berwig, L.C., Ardenghi, T.M., Marquezan, M.",2021,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ORAL SCIENCE,29,,e20201005,,,11,1,10.1590/1678-7757-2020-1005,,"[Assaf, Debora do Canto; Knorst, Jessica Klockner; Ardenghi, Thiago Machado; Marquezan, Mariana] Univ Fed Santa Maria UFSM, Dept Estomatol, Ave Roraima 1000,Cidade Univ,Predio 26F,Sala 2184, BR-97105970 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Busanello-Stella, Angela Ruviaro; Ferrazzo, Vilmar Antonio] Univ Fed Santa Maria UFSM, Dept Fonoaudiol, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Berwig, Luana Cristina] Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",,Mixed dentition; Malocclusion; Orthodontics; Observational study; Speech-language pathologist; Speech therapy,ANTERIOR OPEN BITE; DISORDERS; CHILDREN; IMPACT,Mixed dentition;Malocclusion;Orthodontics;Observational study;Speech-language pathologist;Speech therapy;ANTERIOR OPEN BITE;DISORDERS;CHILDREN;IMPACT,mariana.marquezan@ufsm.br,,"AL DR OCTAVIO PINHEIRO BRISOLLA, 9-75, BAURU-SP, 17012-901, BRAZIL",,,,UNIV SAO PAULO FAC ODONTOLOGIA BAURU,1678-7757,,,34406316,English,J APPL ORAL SCI,Article,WoS,"Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",WOS:000687125100001,2-s2.0-85114518459,Brazil,ufsm.br,Univ Fed Santa Maria UFSM;Hosp Clin Porto Alegre,"Univ Fed Santa Maria UFSM, Brazil;Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Brazil","Assaf, Debora do Canto; Knorst, Jessica Klockner; Busanello-Stella, Angela Ruviaro; Ferrazzo, Vilmar Antonio; Berwig, Luana Cristina; Ardenghi, Thiago Machado; Marquezan, Mariana",,
The db is so generic. Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database,Yes,"Objectives: Extending healthy life expectancy (HALE), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in “full health” by taking into account years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury, is a common topic worldwide. This study aims to clarify the relationships between the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and life expectancy (LE) and HALE globally using publicly available international data. Setting: Analyses were conducted on 130 countries with populations of 1 million or more for which all data were available. Individual countries were scored from 0 to 9 to indicate adherence to the Mediterranean diet according to the MDS scoring method. The supply of vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereals, fish, and olive oil per 1,000 kcal per country was calculated based on the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database, with a score of 1 for above the median and 0 for below. The same method was used to calculate scores of presumed detrimental components (meat and dairy), with consumption below the median given a value of 1, and consumption above the median given a value of 0. For ethanol, a score of 1 was given for 10g to 50 g of consumption. We investigated the cross-sectional associations between the MDS and LE and HALE at birth in 2009, and the longitudinal associations between the MDS in 2009 and LE and HALE between 2009 and 2019, controlling for covariates at baseline using linear mixed models. Results: In the cross-sectional analysis, the MDS was significantly positively associated with LE (β=0.906 [95% confidence interval, 0.065–1.747], p=0.037) and HALE (β=0.875 [0.207–1.544], p=0.011) after controlling for all covariates. The longitudinal analysis also revealed significantly positive associations between the MDS and LE (0.621 [0.063–1.178], p=0.030) and HALE (0.694 [0.227–1.161], p=0.004) after controlling for all covariates. Conclusion: The present study, based on an analysis using 10 years of international data, showed that countries with a higher MDS showed a positive association with HALE. © 2022, Serdi and Springer-Verlag International SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Association between the Mediterranean Diet Score and Healthy Life Expectancy: A Global Comparative Study,"Sezaki A., Imai T., Miyamoto K., Kawase F., Shirai Y., Abe C., Sanada M., Inden A., Rato T., Sugihara N., Shimokata H.",2022,"Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging",26,6,,621,627,,5,10.1007/s12603-022-1811-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131541085&doi=10.1007%2fs12603-022-1811-y&partnerID=40&md5=a08e5f04c350f9ea0b0c130a16f41e06,"Graduate School of Nutritional Science, Nagoya University of Arts and Sciences, Nagoya Gakugei Daigaku, Aichi, Japan;

Review,No,"Background: The emergence of the Internet has triggered tremendous changes in the publication of scientific peer-reviewed journals. Today, journals are usually available in parallel electronic versions, but the way the peer-review process works, the look of articles and journals, and the rigid and slow publication schedules have remained largely unchanged, at least for the vast majority of subscription-based journals. Those publishing firms and scholarly publishers who have chosen the more radical option of open access (OA), in which the content of journals is freely accessible to anybody with Internet connectivity, have had a much bigger degree of freedom to experiment with innovations. Objective: The objective was to study how open access journals have experimented with innovations concerning ways of organizing the peer review, the format of journals and articles, new interactive and media formats, and novel publishing revenue models. Methods: The features of 24 open access journals were studied. The journals were chosen in a nonrandom manner from the approximately 7000 existing OA journals based on available information about interesting journals and include both representative cases and highly innovative outlier cases. Results: Most early OA journals in the 1990s were founded by individual scholars and used a business model based on voluntary work close in spirit to open-source development of software. In the next wave, many long-established journals, in particular society journals and journals from regions such as Latin America, made their articles OA when they started publishing parallel electronic versions. From about 2002 on, newly founded professional OA publishing firms using article-processing charges to fund their operations have emerged. Over the years, there have been several experiments with new forms of peer review, media enhancements, and the inclusion of structured data sets with articles. In recent years, the growth of OA publishing has also been facilitated by the availability of open-source software for journal publishing. Conclusions: The case studies illustrate how a new technology and a business model enabled by new technology can be harnessed to find new innovative ways for the organization and content of scholarly publishing. Several recent launches of OA journals by major subscription publishers demonstrate that OA is rapidly gaining acceptance as a sustainable alternative to subscription-based scholarly publishing. © 2011 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

hospital admission for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke in from the Brazilian Public Health System Database. The monthly unemployment rate was obtained from the Brazilian Institute for Applied Economic Research,Yes,"Background: The effect of socioeconomic stressors on the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently open to debate. Using time-series analysis, our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between unemployment rate and hospital admission for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke in Brazil over a recent 11-year span. Methods and results: Data on monthly hospital admissions for AMI and stroke from March 2002 to December 2013 were extracted from the Brazilian Public Health System Database. The monthly unemployment rate was obtained from the Brazilian Institute for Applied Economic Research, during the same period. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to test the association of temporal series. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. From March 2002 to December 2013, 778,263 admissions for AMI and 1,581,675 for stroke were recorded. During this time period, the unemployment rate decreased from 12.9% in 2002 to 4.3% in 2013, while admissions due to AMI and stroke increased. However, the adjusted ARIMA model showed a positive association between the unemployment rate and admissions for AMI but not for stroke (estimate coefficient = 2.81 +/- 0.93; p = 0.003 and estimate coefficient = 2.40 +/- 4.34; p = 0.58, respectively). Conclusions: From 2002 to 2013, hospital admissions for AMI and stroke increased, whereas the unemployment rate decreased. However, the adjusted ARIMA model showed a positive association between unemployment rate and admissions due to AMI but not for stroke. Further studies are warranted to validate our findings and to better explore the mechanisms by which socioeconomic stressors, such as unemployment, might impact on the incidence of CVD.

Is not a health aplication,No,"Sign languages play an essential role in the cognitive and social development of the deaf, consisting of a natural form of communication and being a symbol of identity and culture. However, hearing loss has a severe social impact due to an existing communication barrier, preventing access to essential services such as education and health. A bi-directional sign language translation may be the solution to bridging the communication gap between the deaf and the listener, completing a two-way communication cycle. Virtual personal assistants can benefit from this technology by extending how users interact with the intelligent system. With this idea, in this work we develop a multi-stream deep learning model to recognize signs of Brazilian (BSL), Indian (ISL), and Korean (KSL) Sign Languages. We combine different types of information for the classification task, using single-stream and multi-stream 3D Convolutional Neural Networks. In addition, considering the largest source of sign data globally - the internet - we propose a depth sensor-free classification method, with depth maps artificially generated through Generative Adversarial Networks. In order to consider the main parameters that encode sign languages, the final architecture is composed of a multi-stream network that receives the segmented hands, the faces, the distances and speeds of the points of articulation, and the RGB frames associated with artificial depth maps. Finally, we provide a visual explanation to understand which regions were important for model decision-making. The best models were obtained using the multi-stream network, presenting an accuracy of 0.91 +/- 0.07, and f1-score of 0.90 +/- 0.08 on publicly available BSL data set. The results suggest that the multi-stream network with artificially generated depth maps is suitable for the task of sign recognition in different languages.",Automatic translation of sign language with multi-stream 3D CNN and generation of artificial depth maps,"de Castro, G.Z., Guerra, R.R., Guimaraes, F.G.",2023,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,215,,119394,,,16,1,10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119394,,"[de Castro, Giulia Zanon; Guerra, Rubia Reis; Guimaraes, Frederico Gadelha] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Elect Engn, Machine Intelligence & Data Sci Lab MINDS, Ave Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [de Castro, Giulia Zanon] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Grad Program Elect Engn, Ave Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",,Sign language recognition; Gesture recognition; Deep learning; 3D convolutional neural networks; Computer vision; Generative adversarial networks,,Sign language recognition;Gesture recognition;Deep learning;3D convolutional neural networks;Computer vision;Generative adversarial networks,giuliaz@ufmg.br; rubiarg@cs.ubc.ca; fredericoguimaraes@ufmg.br,,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",,,,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,0957-4174,,,,English,EXPERT SYST APPL,Article,WoS,Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,WOS:000895304000003,2-s2.0-85143683904,Brazil,ufmg.br,Univ Fed Minas Gerais,"Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Brazil","de Castro, Giulia Zanon; Guerra, Rubia Reis; Guimaraes, Frederico Gadelha",,

In this paper, we present a web-based geospatial toolkit with a user-friendly interactive interface for the monitoring of dengue fever outbreaks, in space and time. Our geospatial toolkit is designed around the integration of (1) a spatial data management module in which epidemiologists upload spatio-temporal explicit data, (2) an analytical module running an accelerated Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to map the outbreaks of dengue fever, (3) a spatial database module to extract pairs of disease events close in space and time and (4) a GIS mapping module to visualize space-time linkages of pairs of disease events. We illustrate our approach on a set of dengue fever cases which occurred in Cali (659 geocoded cases), an urban environment in Colombia. Results indicate that dengue fever cases are significantly clustered, but the degree of intensity varies across the city. The design and implementation of the on-line toolkit underscores the benefits of the approach to monitor vector-borne disease outbreaks in a timely manner and at different scales, facilitating the appropriate allocation of resources. The toolkit is designed collaboratively with health epidemiologists and is portable for other surveillance data at the individual level such as crime or traffic accidents.

"This is not health, and I don't know if is south america",No,"In this study, we demonstrate how urban-dwelling bats can be used to reconstruct Urban Heat Islands (UHI). We term this approach biologically-assisted sampling (BAS). We used Egyptian fruit bats to map the spatial air temperature (Tair) profile. To demonstrate the feasibility of using biologically-assisted sampled data set, we run mixed effects and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models to estimate the impact of urban environment on Tair distribution. Our results suggest that vegetation is a very important mitigating factor in Tair. In the winter, we found an average Tair difference of 2-5 degrees C between densely urban and nearby vegetative/open areas. A distinct UHI spot was identified in the winter, centered on the Ayalon highway. These differences were lower during the summer night, probably due to a pronounced cooling sea breeze effect along the coastline. Our preliminary results also indicate that BAS sampling provide a 3D view of the UHI phenomenon: the change in Tair above the dense urban area was smaller than above the vegetative area. Since the differences in Tair between densely urban and open/green areas are the largest during the night hours, bats can serve as efficient agents to monitor UHI effects, despite the method limitations.",Bat bio-assisted sampling (BAS) for monitoring urban heat island,"Chudnovsky, A., Goldshtein, A., Shashua-Bar, L., Yovel, Y., Potchter, O.",2023,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,155,,102952,,,13,0,10.1016/j.apgeog.2023.102952,,"[Chudnovsky, Alexandra; Potchter, Oded] Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Fac Exact Sci, Porter Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Goldshtein, Aya; Yovel, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Shashua-Bar, Limor] Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Fac Exact Sci, Porter Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Dept Environm Studies, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Yovel, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Potchter, Oded] Beit Berl Coll, Dept Geog, Beit Berl, Israel; [Yovel, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Natl Res Ctr Biodivers Studies, Steinhardt Museum Nat Hist, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Goldshtein, Aya] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, D-78464 Constance, Germany",,Urban heat island (UHI); Air temperature; Biologically-assisted sampling (BAS); Bats; Greenness; Greenness cooling effect,GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION; TEL-AVIV; TEMPERATURE PATTERNS; HEALTH; VEGETATION; STREET; CITY; MITIGATION; ARGENTINA; MORTALITY,Urban heat island (UHI);Air temperature;Biologically-assisted sampling (BAS);Bats;Greenness;Greenness cooling effect;GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION;TEL-AVIV;TEMPERATURE PATTERNS;HEALTH;VEGETATION;STREET;CITY;MITIGATION;ARGENTINA;MORTALITY,achudnov@tauex.tau.ac.il; goldaya@gmail.com; sblimor@gmail.com; yossiyovel@gmail.com; potchter@tauex.tau.ac.il,,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,0143-6228,,,,English,APPL GEOGR,Article,WoS,Geography,WOS:000983439900001,,Israel;Germany,tauex.tau.ac.il,Tel Aviv Univ;Beit Berl Coll;Max Planck Inst Anim Behav,"Tel Aviv Univ, Israel;Beit Berl Coll, Israel;Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Germany","Chudnovsky, Alexandra; Goldshtein, Aya; Shashua-Bar, Limor; Yovel, Yossi; Potchter, Oded",,

Access to the data will follow the rules of the repository system.",Yes,"Introduction BCG vaccination modulates immune responses to unrelated pathogens. This off-target effect could reduce the impact of emerging pathogens. As a readily available, inexpensive intervention that has a well-established safety profile, BCG is a good candidate for protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) and other vulnerable groups against COVID-19. Methods and analysis This international multicentre phase III randomised controlled trial aims to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the incidence of symptomatic and severe COVID-19 at 6 months (co-primary outcomes) compared with no BCG vaccination. We plan to randomise 10 078 HCWs from Australia, The Netherlands, Spain, the UK and Brazil in a 1:1 ratio to BCG vaccination or no BCG (control group). The participants will be followed for 1 year with questionnaires and collection of blood samples. For any episode of illness, clinical details will be collected daily, and the participant will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The secondary objectives are to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the rate, incidence, and severity of any febrile or respiratory illness (including SARS-CoV-2), as well as work absenteeism. The safety of BCG vaccination in HCWs will also be evaluated. Immunological analyses will assess changes in the immune system following vaccination, and identify factors associated with susceptibility to or protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other infections. Ethics and dissemination Ethical and governance approval will be obtained from participating sites. Results will be published in peer-reviewed open-access journals.

Review,No,"In the face of criticism on the lack of a systematization of psychological practice in health, was aimed to present a systematic review in open access on-line databases and analyze the scientific articles analytical behavior, published between 2005 and 2014, in Health Psychology. Two procedures were made in VHL Psychology Brazil, specifically in the Index Psi Technical-Scientific Journals, the Scientific Electronic Library On-line and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature. In Collection 1, was used the search strategy ""behavior analysis"" AND health OR ""behavioral medicine"" OR ""medical psychology"", which terms should be included as ""words"" or ""in all indexes"". In Collection 2, was used ""psychology"" AND other terms referring to 45 specialties of Medicine, present in the ""abstract"". The Registration Form of Scientific Articles guided the quanti-qualitative analysis on the basis of seven items: reference, year of publication, type of study, objectives, participants, procedures and conclusions. The results suggested the applicability of Behavior Analysis to healthcare, although the number of recovered items has been restricted due to conceptual and methodological obstacles.

The Brazilian National Healthcare Database (DATASUS) was queried to identify unadjusted all-cause POMR (perioperative mortality rate),Yes,"Background All-cause perioperative mortality rate (POMR) is a commonly reported metric to assess surgical quality. Benchmarking POMR remains difficult due to differences in surgical volume and case mix combined with the burden of reporting and leveraging this complex and high-volume data. We seek to determine whether the pooled and individual procedure POMR of each bellwether (cesarean section, laparotomy, management of open fracture) correlate with state-level all-cause POMR in the interest of identifying benchmark procedures that can be used to make standardized regional comparisons of surgical quality. Methods The Brazilian National Healthcare Database (DATASUS) was queried to identify unadjusted all-cause POMR for all patient admissions among public hospitals in Brazil in 2018. Bellwether procedures were identified as any procedure involving laparotomy, cesarean section, or treatment of open long bone fracture and then classified as emergent or elective. The pooled POMR of all bellwether procedures as well as for each individual bellwether procedure was compared with the all-cause POMR in each of the 26 states, and one federal district and correlations were calculated. Funnel plots were used to compare surgical volume to perioperative mortality for each bellwether procedure. Results 4,756,642 surgical procedures were reported to DATASUS in 2018: 237,727 emergent procedures requiring laparotomy, 852,821 emergent cesarean sections, and 210,657 open, long bone fracture repairs. Pooled perioperative mortality for all of the bellwether procedures was correlated with all-procedure POMR among states (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). POMR for emergency procedures (2.4%) correlated with the all-procedure (emergent and elective) POMR (1.6%, r = 0.93, p < .001), while POMR for elective procedures (0.4%) did not (p = .247). POMR for emergency laparotomy (4.4%) correlated with all-procedure POMR (1.6%, r = 0.52, p = .005), as did the POMR for open, long bone fractures (0.8%, r = 0.61, p < .001). POMR for emergency cesarean section (0.05%) did not correlate with all-procedure POMR (p = 0.400). There was a correlation between surgical volume and emergency laparotomy POMR (r = - 0.53, p = .004), but not for emergency cesarean section or open, long bone fractures POMR. Conclusion Procedure-specific POMR for laparotomy and open long bone fracture correlates modestly with all-procedure POMR among Brazilian states which is primarily driven by emergency procedure POMR. Selective reporting of emergency laparotomy and open fracture POMR may be a useful surrogate to guide subnational surgical policy decisions.",Bellwether Procedures for Monitoring Subnational Variation of All-cause Perioperative Mortality in Brazil,"Truche, P., Roa, L., Citron, I., Caddell, L., Neto, J., Reis, M., Moore, E., Botelho, F., Alonso, N., Watters, D.",2020,WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY,44,10,,3299,3309,11,6,10.1007/s00268-020-05607-x,,"[Truche, Paul; Roa, Lina; Citron, Isabelle; Caddell, Luke; Reis, Matheus] Harvard Med Sch, Program Global Surg & Social Change, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Roa, Lina] Univ Alberta, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Neto, Joao] Univ Sao Paulo, FMUSP, Fac Med, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Moore, Eileen] Deakin Univ, Dept Surg, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Moore, Eileen; Watters, David] Barwon Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Botelho, Fabio] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Alonso, Nivaldo] Univ Sao Paulo, Div Plast Surg, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Watters, David] Deakin Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,,MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; GLOBAL SURGERY; EMERGENCY LAPAROTOMY; SURGICAL MORTALITY; LANCET COMMISSION; CESAREAN DELIVERY; HEALTH; INDICATOR; RELIABILITY; ACCESS,MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES;GLOBAL SURGERY;EMERGENCY LAPAROTOMY;SURGICAL MORTALITY;LANCET COMMISSION;CESAREAN DELIVERY;HEALTH;INDICATOR;RELIABILITY;ACCESS,ptruche@hsph.harvard.edu; lina_roa@hms.harvard.edu; Isabelle.citron@gmail.com; caddell.luke@gmail.com; joao.batista@fm.usp.br; matheus.reis@fm.usp.br; dr.eileenmoore@gmail.com; mendesbotelho@hotmail.com; nivalonso@usp.br; watters.david@gmail.com,,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,,SPRINGER,0364-2313,,,32488666,English,WORLD J SURG,Article,WoS,Surgery,WOS:000537417200001,2-s2.0-85085892071,United States;Canada;Brazil;Australia,hsph.harvard.edu,Harvard Med Sch;Univ Alberta;Univ Sao Paulo;Deakin Univ;Barwon Hlth;Univ Fed Minas Gerais,"Harvard Med Sch, United States;Univ Alberta, Canada;Univ Sao Paulo, Brazil;Deakin Univ, Australia;Barwon Hlth, Australia;Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Brazil","Truche, Paul; Roa, Lina; Citron, Isabelle; Caddell, Luke; Neto, Joao; Reis, Matheus; Moore, Eileen; Botelho, Fabio; Alonso, Nivaldo; Watters, David",,
Data from the informatics department of the Brazilian Public Health System database,Yes,"Objective: To describe and compare the number of surgeries, mortality rate, length of hospital stay, and costs of transurethral resection of the prostate and open prostatectomy for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, between 2008 and 2018, in the Public Health System in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Ecological and retrospective study using data from the informatics department of the Brazilian Public Health System database. Procedure codes were ""open prostatectomy"" and ""transurethral resection of the prostate."" The outcomes analyzed were compared between transurethral resection of the prostate and open prostatectomy according to the hospital surgical volume and presence or absence of a residency program. Results: A total of 18,874 surgeries were analyzed (77% transurethral resection of the prostate) and overall mortality was not statistically different between procedures. Intermediate and high-volume centers had shorter length of hospital stay than low-volume centers for transurethral resection of the prostate (3.28, 3.02, and 6.58 days, respectively, p=0.01 and p=0.004). Length of hospital stay was also shorter for open prostatectomy in high-volume compared to low-volume centers (4.86 versus 10.76 days, p=0.036). Intrahospital mortality was inversely associated with surgical volume for transurethral resection of the prostate. Centers with residency program had shorter length of hospital stay considering open prostatectomy and less mortality regarding transurethral resection of the prostate. Open prostatectomy was 64% more expensive than transurethral resection of the prostate. Conclusion: The findings suggest the importance of investing in specialized centers, which could be potential referral centers for surgical cases.","Benign prostatic hyperplasia surgical treatment trends in the Public Health System in Sao Paulo, Brazil","Barbosa, A.R.G., Takemura, L.S., Amaral, B.S., Wroclawski, M.L., Alfer, W., Gil, A.O., Monteiro, J., Lourenco, D.B., Cha, J.D., Apezzato, M., Barbosa, J.A.B.A., Bianco, B., Lemos, G.C., Carneiro, A.",2022,EINSTEIN-SAO PAULO,20,,eAO6880,,,6,0,10.31744/einstein_journal/2022AO6880,,"[Gomes Barbosa, Alan Roger; Takemura, Lucas Seiti; Amaral, Breno Santos; Wroclawski, Marcelo Langer; Alfer, Wladimir, Jr.; Gil, Antonio Otero; Monteiro, Jose, Jr.; Lourenco, Danilo Budib; Cha, Jonathan Doyun; Apezzato, Marcelo; Brunhara Alves Barbosa, Joao Arthur; Bianco, Bianca; Lemos, Gustavo Caserta; Carneiro, Arie] Hosp Israelita Albert Einstein, Ave Albert Einstein,627-701,Room 303,Bldg A1, BR-05652900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",,Prostatic hyperplasia; Transurethral resection of prostate; Prostatectomy; Postoperative complications; Treatment outcome; Length of stay; Mortality,URINARY-TRACT SYMPTOMS; PROSTATECTOMY,Prostatic hyperplasia;Transurethral resection of prostate;Prostatectomy;Postoperative complications;Treatment outcome;Length of stay;Mortality;URINARY-TRACT SYMPTOMS,arie.carneiro@einstein.br,,"AVENIDA ALBERT EINSTEIN, 627 701, SAO PAULO SP, 05651-901, BRAZIL",,,,INST ISRAELITA ENSINO & PESQUISA ALBERT EINSTEIN,1679-4508,,,35730806,English,EINSTEIN-SAO PAULO,Article,WoS,General & Internal Medicine,WOS:000849866300046,2-s2.0-85132246397,Brazil,einstein.br,Hosp Israelita Albert Einstein,"Hosp Israelita Albert Einstein, Brazil","Gomes Barbosa, Alan Roger; Takemura, Lucas Seiti; Amaral, Breno Santos; Wroclawski, Marcelo Langer; Alfer, Wladimir, Jr.; Gil, Antonio Otero; Monteiro, Jose, Jr.; Lourenco, Danilo Budib; Cha, Jonathan Doyun; Apezzato, Marcelo; Brunhara Alves Barbosa, Joao Arthur; Bianco, Bianca; Lemos, Gustavo Caserta; Carneiro, Arie",,
Review,No,"Overviews synthesising the results of multiple systematic reviews help inform evidence-based clinical practice. In this first of two companion papers, we evaluate the bibliometrics of overviews, including their prevalence and factors affecting citation rates and journal impact factor (JIF). We searched MEDLINE, Epistemonikos and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). We included overviews that: (a) synthesised reviews, (b) conducted a systematic search, (c) had a methods section and (d) examined a healthcare intervention. Multivariable regression was conducted to determine the association between citation density, JIF and six predictor variables. We found 1218 overviews published from 2000 to 2020; the majority (73%) were published in the most recent 5-year period. We extracted a selection of these overviews (n = 541; 44%) dated from 2000 to 2018. The 541 overviews were published in 307 journals; CDSR (8%), PLOS ONE (3%) and Sao Paulo Medical Journal (2%) were the most prevalent. The majority (70%) were published in journals with impact factors between 0.05 and 3.97. We found a mean citation count of 10 overviews per year, published in journals with a mean JIF of 4.4.

Is in agriculture,No,"Land-use effects on microbial communities may have profound impacts on agricultural productivity and ecosystem sustainability because they are critical to soil quality and health. Within this context, soil microbiological properties such as microorganism abundance, total microbial biomass, and enzymatic activities have been used as soil quality indicators. However, these properties are very sensitive to changes triggered by agronomic management. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of agricultural practices in the vineyards from the Central Monte Desert, San Juan, Argentina including the effects on soil microbial biomass using soils from the open shrubland as a reference. The microbial biomass carbon was significantly greater in soils from the open shrubland than in the vineyards during April and November. The abundance of cultivable soil microorganisms (bacteria and filamentous fungi) in soil samples from vineyards and open shrubland was statistically similar. Vineyard soils showed increased enzymatic activities (both in rows and between rows) in both seasons. We used multivariate analysis of all data measured here to propose a data set of variables (amylase, cellulase, and xylanase activities, bacterial abundance, microbial biomass and water content, pH and electric conductivity) for use in future studies of soil quality in the Central Monte Desert.",Bioindicators of soil quality of open shrubland and vineyards,"Vega-Avila, A., Medina, E., Paroldi, H., Toro, M., Baigori, M., Vazquez, F.",2018,JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,18,4,,1065,1079,15,7,,,"[Vega-Avila, Angela; Medina, Emilce; Paroldi, Hector; Toro, Maria; Vazquez, Fabio] Univ Nacl San Juan, Fac Ingn, IBT Inst Biotecnol, RA-5400 San Juan, Argentina; [Baigori, Mario] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, PROIMI Proc Ind Microbiol, San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina",,Enzyme activity; microbial biomass carbon; arid systems,MICROBIAL BIOMASS; BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITIES; EXTRACTION METHOD; ORGANIC-CARBON; RESILIENCE; INSIGHTS; TILLAGE; SYSTEMS; LAND,Enzyme activity;microbial biomass carbon;arid systems;MICROBIAL BIOMASS;BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITIES;EXTRACTION METHOD;ORGANIC-CARBON;RESILIENCE;INSIGHTS;TILLAGE;SYSTEMS;LAND,emedina@unsj.edu.ar,,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,0718-9516,,,,English,J SOIL SCI PLANT NUT,Article,WoS,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture,WOS:000457878500011,2-s2.0-85062084600,Argentina,unsj.edu.ar,Univ Nacl San Juan;Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn,"Univ Nacl San Juan, Argentina;Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Argentina","Vega-Avila, Angela; Medina, Emilce; Paroldi, Hector; Toro, Maria; Baigori, Mario; Vazquez, Fabio",,
"Is health related, but I don't know how relevant",No,"The Brazilian Amazon represents about 40% of the world's remaining tropical rainforest. However, human activities have become important drivers of disturbance in that region. The majority of forest fire hotspots in the Amazon arc due to deforestation are impacting the health of the local population of over 10 million inhabitants. In this study we characterize western Amazonia biomass burning emissions through the quantification of 14 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Organic Carbon, Elemental Carbon and unique tracers of biomass burning such as levoglucosan. From the PAHs dataset a toxic equivalence factor is calculated estimating the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential of biomass burning emissions during the studied period. Peak concentration of PM10 during the dry seasons was observed to reach 60 mu g m(-3) on the 24 h average. Conversely, PM10 was relatively constant throughout the wet season indicating an overall stable balance between aerosol sources and sinks within the filter sampling resolution. Similar behavior is identified for OC and EC components. Levoglucosan was found in significant concentrations (up to 4 mu g m(-3)) during the dry season. Correspondingly, the estimated lung cancer risk calculated during the dry seasons largely exceeded the WHO health-based guideline. A source apportionment study was carried out through the use of Absolute Principal Factor Analysis (APFA), identifying a three-factor solution. The biomass burning factor is found to be the dominating aerosol source, having 75.4% of PM10 loading. The second factor depicts an important contribution of several PAHs without a single source class and therefore was considered as mixed sources factor, contributing to 6.3% of PM10. The third factor was mainly associated with fossil fuel combustion emissions, contributing to 18.4% of PM10. This work enhances the knowledge of aerosol sources and its impact on climate variability and local population, on a site representative of the deforestation which occupies a significant fraction of the Amazon basin.

They just mention the term open data,No,"Over the past five years, efforts to set up a Brazilian clinical trials registry have progressed from early discussions in academic forums through to the establishment of the registry as a web-based computer platform. This article describes the process of developing and introducing the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (ReBEC), and its relationship with the authorities that regulate clinical research in Brazil. The Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry and the multilingual, free and open source, internet-based software developed to manage it are outcomes of partnerships among Brazilian federal and international health agencies. Information for describing the technical and operational dimensions of Rebec was drawn from technical documents and the records of the OpenTrials software development team and the ReBEC executive and advisory committees, which are available in free-access repositories. The Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry was launched in December 2010, and approved as a primary registry of the WHO ICTRP network in April 2011. ReBEC's arrival on-line and its acceptance as an ICTRP primary registry is a significant step in consolidating a policy of free access to information on clinical research in Brazil. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd and Chinese Cochrane Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University.",Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry and the challenges for clinical research governance,"Laguardia J., Piolli A.L., Prevot M., Ramalho L., Gamarski R., Nishizawa C.",2011,Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine,4,3,,156,160,,1,10.1111/j.1756-5391.2011.01145.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052159237&doi=10.1111%2fj.1756-5391.2011.01145.x&partnerID=40&md5=d7441152873c78dfdcce862000bad6c6,"Instituto de Comunicação e Informacão Cientifica e Tecnologica em Saude, ICICT, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Instituto de Geociências, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, Brazil; Centro Latino-Americano de Informação em Ciências da Saúde, Bireme, Organização Pan-Americana da Saúde, São Paulo, Brazil; Secretaria de Ciência, Tecnologia e Insumos Estratégicos - SCTIE, Ministério da Saúde, Brasília, Brazil; Gerência Geral de Medicamentos, Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária - Anvisa, Brasília, Brazil","Laguardia, J., Instituto de Comunicação e Informacão Cientifica e Tecnologica em Saude, ICICT, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Piolli, A.L., Instituto de Geociências, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, Brazil; Prevot, M., Instituto de Comunicação e Informacão Cientifica e Tecnologica em Saude, ICICT, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Ramalho, L., Centro Latino-Americano de Informação em Ciências da Saúde, Bireme, Organização Pan-Americana da Saúde, São Paulo, Brazil; Gamarski, R., Secretaria de Ciência, Tecnologia e Insumos Estratégicos - SCTIE, Ministério da Saúde, Brasília, Brazil; Nishizawa, C., Gerência Geral de Medicamentos, Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária - Anvisa, Brasília, Brazil",Brazil; Clinical trials; Governance; Latin America; ReBEC,advisory committee; article; bibliographic database; Brazil; clinical research; clinical trial (topic); health care quality; human; information retrieval; information system; priority journal; professional standard; scientific literature; Biomedical Research; Brazil; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Latin America; Registries,Brazil;Clinical trials;Governance;Latin America;ReBEC;advisory committee;article;bibliographic database;clinical research;clinical trial (topic);health care quality;human;information retrieval;information system;priority journal;professional standard;scientific literature;Biomedical Research;Clinical Trials as Topic;Humans;Registries,"Laguardia, J.; Instituto de Comunicação e Informacão Cientifica e Tecnologica em Saude, Av.

,No,"This work presents an innovative Brazilian experience of use of free software in public administration and its preliminary impacts on the Brazilian society. It describes a new concept: the Brazilian Public Software (BPS) developed by policy makers of the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management. The policy makers were concerned with the limitations of Free Software Model of Production (FSMP) to public administration. Efforts have been made to create an ambience where public entities could download and install software. Issues like installation and operational support, quality of software (user interfaces, manuals, etc), bugs, etc., were not effectively solved by the FSMP alone. On the other hand, the Government was also interested in creating a virtual ambience in which private entities could also open and share their software. It meant having additional intellectual property issues, brand issues, etc. Then, the policy makers of the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management shaped the new concept, the Brazilian Public Software that is based on code opening (FSMP), but includes some additional duties to the entity that makes the software available. To support and to make the concept operational an institutional, an environment was formed and so a virtual ambience named Brazilian Public Software Portal (BPSP) began to exist. Since their beginning in 2006, BPSP (www.softwarepublico.gov.br) increased their number of associates to 40,000 users and today it has 22 software solutions available, in many technological areas: geo-processing, health, public town management (sanitation, hospitals management, data management, etc) even software solutions originated from private entities that had public interest like textual database and web application server ambience. Others related portals were created like: 4CMBr, driven to municipalities; Virtual Market focused on services; 5CQualiBr centered on the quality of the software in a large sense and in the ecosystem sustainability. The 5CQualiBr is under construction and it is an outcome of the partnership with the Information Technology Center Renato Archer - CTI, from which the present article is part of. The preliminary impacts of BPS are concerned with: government software development cost reduction; reuse of software and increase of software longevity; improvement of technological apprenticeship inside the technical communities of the Government; support to small municipalities on introducing the Information and Communication Technology (ICTs) in the management process, and even introducing a digital culture where there was not anyone; creation of an ambience of collaborative software development.",Brazilian Public Software and its Impact on Brazilian Society,"Alves, A., Stefanuto, G., Castro, P., Eleuterio, S.V.",2009,PROCEEDINGS OF 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON E-GOVERNMENT,,,,187,191,5,1,,,"[Alves, Angela; Stefanuto, Giancarlo; Castro, Paula; Eleuterio, Sueli Varani] Ctr Tecnol Informacao Renato Archer CTI, Campinas, SP, Brazil",,Brazilian Public Software; ecosystem; grounded theory,,Brazilian Public Software;ecosystem;grounded theory,angela.alves@cti.gov.br; gianstefanuto@gmail.com; paulafdc@gmail.com; sueli.varani@cti.gov.br,"Lavin, M","CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",5th International Conference on e-Government,"Suffolk Univ, Boston, MA","OCT 19-20, 2009",ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,,978-1-906638-50-4,,,English,,Proceedings Paper,WoS,Computer Science; Government & Law,WOS:000280756500021,2-s2.0-79952374667,Brazil,cti.gov.br,Ctr Tecnol Informacao Renato Archer CTI,"Ctr Tecnol Informacao Renato Archer CTI, Brazil","Alves, Angela; Stefanuto, Giancarlo; Castro, Paula; Eleuterio, Sueli Varani",,

"number of mammograms performed by the Brazilian public health services, provided by DATASUS, an open access database",Yes,"OBJECTIVE: To report the decrease in breast imaging after covid-19 pandemic, obtaining the number of mammograms performed in 2019 and 2020. Additionally, to investigate if there was an increase in the proportion of women undergoing mammography for diagnostic purposes, with palpable lesions. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study, based on the number of mammograms performed by the Brazilian public health services, provided by DATASUS, an open access database. Mammograms from private institutions were not included. This study compares the number of mammograms performed in 2019 and 2020, in women aged 50-69 years, stratified by month, in each federal state, and the presence of palpable lumps (physician-reported). RESULTS: In total, 1,948,471 mammograms were performed in 2019 and 1,126,688 in 2020, for the population studied. These values represent a 42% decline. Monthly, a significant decreased is observed after April 2020. The results varied slightly according to federal state; yet the entire country was affected. Rondonia was the most affected state, with 67% decline. The proportion of women presenting palpable lumps increased from 7.06% on average in 2019 to 7.94% in 2020 (OR = 1.135, 95%CI 1.125-1.145, p = 0,001). DISCUSSION: The number of mammograms performed in 2020 declined considerably. Out of the women who presented for mammogram, the proportion of palpable lumps was significantly higher in 2020. Considering the detection rate of digital mammography, the loss of 800,000 exams means 4,000 undiagnosed breast cancer cases, by the end of 2020.","Breast imaging hindered during covid-19 pandemic, in Brazil","Bessa, J.D.",2021,REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA,55,,8,,,8,9,10.11606/s1518-8787.2021055003375,,"[Bessa, Jordana de Faria] Hosp Sao Luiz, Matter Grp Assistencia Med, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",,"Mammography, statistics & numerical data; Breast Neoplasms diagnosis; Coronavirus Infections; State Health Care Coverage",CANCER SURVIVAL; SURVEILLANCE; MAMMOGRAPHY,"Mammography, statistics & numerical data;Breast Neoplasms diagnosis;Coronavirus Infections;State Health Care Coverage;CANCER SURVIVAL;SURVEILLANCE;MAMMOGRAPHY",jordana.bessa@gmail.com,,"FACULDADE SAUDE PUBL DA USP, AV DR ARNALDO 715, 01246-904SP SAO PAULO, BRAZIL",,,,REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA,0034-8910,,,33978114,English,REV SAUDE PUBL,Article,WoS,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",WOS:000651644400002,2-s2.0-85105769570,Brazil,gmail.com,Hosp Sao Luiz,"Hosp Sao Luiz, Brazil","Bessa, Jordana de Faria",,
"Is not a health related db, but could be an interesting approach",No,"Humans as sensors is the paradigm for transforming the idea of a 'smart city' into the concept of a 'cognitive city'. While the concept of smart cities is based on the notion of using technology to improve city life, cognitive cities take it a step further by utilizing the large amounts of data generated by people to make informed decisions. In developed countries, numerous projects have been successfully implemented using cognitive computing models in areas such as health, transport, and energy sustainability. However, in developing countries such as Ecuador, the collection of data is often a challenge, making it difficult to implement these types of projects. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comprehensive approach to identify available data sources, including open data, social media, and IoT networks, to start the path toward cognitive cities. Our main objective is to present and facilitate the understanding of those datasets by classifying them according to their context of use around their importance in a cognitive city. In this sense, this document consolidates 547 datasets from open portals and describes several proposals in which sensors generate data as part of the Internet of Things infrastructures. Besides, we corroborated that Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube are the most used online social networks in terms of e-participation mainly. We then identified the most relevant categories based on the data available from the analyzed data sources for cities in Ecuador. The results presented establish the need to understand, retrieve and use these data by government, academic, industrial, or research entities. Thus, decision-making processes may be implemented to improve the quality of life of citizens on the basis of available data and aim at building a cognitive country. © 2023 IEEE.",Building Cognitive Cities in Developing Countries: Ecuador Case Study,"Martinez-Mosquera D., Recalde L., Tipantuna C.",2023,"2023 9th International Conference on eDemocracy and eGovernment, ICEDEG 2023",,,,,,,0,10.1109/ICEDEG58167.2023.10121914,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160738952&doi=10.1109%2fICEDEG58167.2023.10121914&partnerID=40&md5=39112ce7b624bfa7fbe46ad2b947f4b1,"Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Departamento de Informática y Ciencias de la Computación, Quito, Ecuador; Telecomunicaciones y Redes de la Información Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Departamento de Electrónica, Quito, Ecuador","Martinez-Mosquera, D., Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Departamento de Informática y Ciencias de la Computación, Quito, Ecuador; Recalde, L., Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Departamento de Informática y Ciencias de la Computación, Quito, Ecuador; Tipantuna, C., Telecomunicaciones y Redes de la Información Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Departamento de Electrónica, Quito, Ecuador",cognitive cities; data; developing countries; IoT networks; open data; social media,Behavioral research; Classification (of information); Decision making; Industrial research; Internet of things; Open Data; Smart city; Social networking (online); Case-studies; Cognitive cities; Data; Data-source; Ecuador; Informed decision; IoT network; Large amounts of data; Open datum; Social media; Developing countries,cognitive cities;data;developing countries;IoT networks;open data;social media;Behavioral research;Classification (of information);Decision making;Industrial research;Internet of things;Smart city;Social networking (online);Case-studies;Data-source;Ecuador;Informed decision;IoT network;Large amounts of data;Open datum,,Vaca C.Riofrio D.Pincay J.Teran L.Teran L.,,"9th International Conference on eDemocracy and eGovernment, ICEDEG 2023",,3 April 2023 through 5 April 2023,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9798350324501,,,English,"Int.

They are not reporting open data,No,"Introduction. Four hundred newborns die every year in our country suffering from congenital heart disease. Definitive surgical repair, whenever possible, is nowadays the optimal therapeutic strategy. Our goal is to describe mortality and morbidity in neonatal surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in a tertiary public hospital in Argentina. Patients and methods. Descriptive, retrospective study. Every patient, younger than 45 days, with cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, at the Garrahan Hospital between 2004 and 2008 was included. Demographic, surgical and postoperative data were collected. Adjusted mortality risk analysis, and descriptive statistics from the most frequent diagnosis were performed. Results are expressed as median and rank or percentage. Results. 200 newborns were operated, 62% males. Median age was 21 days (r 1- 45) and median weight 3.1 kg (r 1.6-6.2). Total anomalous pulmonary venous return, transposition of great arteries an hypoplastic left heart syndrome diagnoses accounted for 75% of the procedures. Median length of stay was 12 days (r 0-191), and 6 days of mechanical ventilation (r 0-180). Eighteen percent of the patients required peritoneal dialysis. Whole series mortality was 19% and fell to 14% in 2008. Unstable preoperative condition and postoperative complications increased mortality, OR= 2.23 (1.02-4.89) and OR= 10 (3.6-33.4), respectively.

"Cataract surgery rates were obtained from National Society of Ophthalmology, National VISION 2020/Prevention of Blindness Committee and Ministry of Health representatives for each country for 2005 to 2008",Yes,"Purpose: To collect cataract surgery rates data in 19 Latin American countries over a 4-year period as data published to date have been limited. Methods: Cataract surgery rates were obtained from National Society of Ophthalmology, National VISION 2020/Prevention of Blindness Committee and Ministry of Health representatives for each country for 2005 to 2008. Economic (gross national income per capita) and other data were collected from publicly available databases. Linear and power correlations between gross national incomes and cataract surgery rates were calculated. Results: Over the study period, most countries increased their cataract surgery rates, with the largest increases observed for Venezuela (186%), Nicaragua (183%), Costa Rica (100%), Uruguay (97%), and Peru (88%). Mean cataract surgery rates for 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 for the ensemble of countries were 1545, 1684, 1660, and 1822 per million population, respectively, with a growth over the study period of 17.9%, concurrent with an increase of 57 million (11.5%) in the population. A good correlation between cataract surgery rate and gross national income per capita was found (P <.001). Conclusions: Although progress is being made in the region, the cataract surgery rates represent only one parameter. When they are examined in the context of cataract surgical coverage it is clear that substantial proportions of bilaterally blind persons are still not receiving surgery. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.",Cataract surgery rates in Latin America: A four-year longitudinal study of 19 countries,"Lansingh V.C., Resnikoff S., Tingley-Kelley K., Nano M.E., Martens M., Silva J.C., Duerksen R., Carter M.J.",2010,Ophthalmic Epidemiology,17,2,,75,81,,40,10.3109/09286581003624962,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77950175019&doi=10.3109%2f09286581003624962&partnerID=40&md5=ad8ef112159d0bdae6a385b3dd2d96b4,"Fundacion Hugo Nano, International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, VISION 2020 la Office, Buenos Aires, Argentina; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland; Strategic Solutions, Inc., 1143 Salsbury Ave, Cody, WY 82414, United States; Pan American Health Organization, Santa Fe de Bogotá DC, Colombia; Fundacion Vision, Asuncion, Paraguay","Lansingh, V.C., Fundacion Hugo Nano, International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, VISION 2020 la Office, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fundacion Vision, Asuncion, Paraguay; Resnikoff, S., World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland; Tingley-Kelley, K., Strategic Solutions, Inc., 1143 Salsbury Ave, Cody, WY 82414, United States; Nano, M.E., Fundacion Hugo Nano, International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, VISION 2020 la Office, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Martens, M., Fundacion Hugo Nano, International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, VISION 2020 la Office, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Silva, J.C., Pan American Health Organization, Santa Fe de Bogotá DC, Colombia; Duerksen, R., Fundacion Vision, Asuncion, Paraguay; Carter, M.J., Strategic Solutions, Inc., 1143 Salsbury Ave, Cody, WY 82414, United States",Cataract extraction/rate; Correlation of data; Latin America; Ophthalmologist; Socioeconomic factors,"article; blindness; cataract; cataract extraction; controlled study; health economics; health service; human; income; information processing; medical society; priority journal; South and Central America; Cataract; Cataract Extraction; Databases, Factual; Delivery of Health Care; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Latin America; Longitudinal Studies; Ophthalmology","Cataract extraction/rate;Correlation of data;Latin America;Ophthalmologist;Socioeconomic factors;article;blindness;cataract;cataract extraction;controlled study;health economics;health service;human;income;information processing;medical society;priority journal;South and Central America;Databases, Factual;Delivery of Health Care;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Ophthalmology","Carter, M.

Review,No,"Objective: This article describes and analyses the characteristics of the expansion of private dental education in Brazil from 1996 to December 2018 and its relationships with public policies and the country’s labour and education market in dentistry. Method: The study used an exploratory and descriptive quantitative approach involving standardised data-collection techniques from open-access secondary databases. Result: From 1996 to 2018 there was an overall increase of 315% in dental schools (582% in the private sector and 49% in the public sector). Brazil had 374 dental schools in December 2018, 307 of which were private and 67 of which were public. The 374 schools offered 47,192 admission places, 89% of which were private. In five states, dental education is 100% private, while in another 19 states the private supply exceeds 70% of the total. In the other three states this offer is between 40% and 67%. From 1996 to 2016, the private sector’s share of dental school graduates was 66%. Women represented 73% of Brazilian dental-school graduates in 2016. Conclusion: Privatisation of dental education in Brazil raises challenges for the development of policies, planning, organisation of care, and structuring of the training process for dentists, as well as the dynamics of the labour market in the health system. © 2020 FDI World Dental Federation",Characteristics and trends in the expansion of private dental schools in Brazil,"Maia L.S., Dal Poz M.R.",2020,International Dental Journal,70,6,,435,443,,0,10.1111/idj.12589,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088792509&doi=10.1111%2fidj.12589&partnerID=40&md5=231f0d4b05036764d5c7ad5d6de9c5d9,"Instituto de Medicina Social, Universidade de Estado de Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Maia, L.S., Instituto de Medicina Social, Universidade de Estado de Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Dal Poz, M.R., Instituto de Medicina Social, Universidade de Estado de Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",dentists; human resources in health; Privatisation; professional training,"adult; article; Brazil; dental education; dentist; exploratory research; female; human; human experiment; job market; private sector; public sector; quantitative analysis; Brazil; public sector; school; Brazil; Female; Humans; Private Sector; Public Sector; Schools; Schools, Dental","dentists;human resources in health;Privatisation;professional training;adult;article;Brazil;dental education;dentist;exploratory research;female;human;human experiment;job market;private sector;public sector;quantitative analysis;school;Humans;Schools;Schools, Dental","Maia, L.S.; Instituto de Medicina Social, Brazil; email: senna.maia@gmail.com",,,,,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,206539,,,32737890,English,Int.

"Data were aggregated from the following open access databases: National Program for Access and Quality Improvement in Primary Care, the Hospital Information System of Brazilian Unified Health System and Annual Population Census conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics",Yes,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association among characteristics of primary health care center (PHCC) with hospitalizations for primary care sensitive conditions (PCSC) in Brazil. METHOD: In this study, a cross-sectional ecological study was performed. This study analyzed the 27 capitals of Brazil's federative units. Data were aggregated from the following open access databases: National Program for Access and Quality Improvement in Primary Care, the Hospital Information System of Brazilian Unified Health System and Annual Population Census conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Associations were estimated among characteristics of primary care with the number of three PCSC as the leading causes of hospitalization in children under-5 population in Brazil: asthma, diarrhea, and pneumonia. RESULTS: In general, PHCC showed limited structural adequacy (37.3%) for pediatric care in Brazil. The capitals in South and Southeast regions had the best structure whereas the North and Northeast had the worst. Fewer PCSC hospitalizations were significantly associated with PHCC which presented appropriate equipment (RR: 0.98; 95%CI: 0.97-0.99), structural conditions (RR: 0.98; 95%CI: 0.97-0.99), and signage/identification of professionals and facilities (RR: 0.98; 95%CI: 0.97-0.99). Higher PCSC hospitalizations were significantly associated with PHCC with more physicians (RR: 1.23, 95%CI: 1.02-1.48), it forms (RR: 1.01, 95%CI: 1.01-1.02), and more medications (RR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01-1.03). CONCLUSION: Infrastructural adequacy of PHCC was associated with less PCSC hospitalizations, while availability medical professional and medications were associated with higher PCSC hospitalizations.

Review,No,"BackgroundThis study aims to describe the training offered and the availability of professionals required by the Ministry of Health for mental health problems management in the community.MethodsA cross-sectional study was carried out on the training offered in mental health in Peruvian universities. A search for programs was conducted using the University Information System database and universities' websites, as well as using the Ministry of Health's database on health personnel and data on the number of enrolled and current students provided by the University Information System database and the Transparency section of the universities.ResultsThere were 214 undergraduate, 55 specialty and 7 subspecialty programmes, of which 39%, 47% and 100%, respectively, were offered in the capital city. The duration ranged from 5 to 7 years for undergraduate programs and from 1 to 3 years for subspecialty and second specialty programs. The cost of undergraduate programs ranged from free of charge up to USD 6863.75 for the first semester of study. Second specialty programs ranged from 720 up to 11 986 USD and subspecialty programs ranged from 2267 up to 9138 USD, with medicine being the most expensive. On the other hand, there are a greater number of psychology students (n = 78 781) pursuing undergraduate studies than working professionals (n = 5368), while in the second specialty of psychiatry there are far fewer students pursuing the specialty (n = 67) than working professionals (n = 454).ConclusionsThe problem of professional training in mental health requires that the institutions involved in health and education develop policies to decentralize programs, communicate the demand for professionals in certain areas, make them accessible to the low-income population, respond to mental health problems and guarantee their quality. On the other hand, regarding the low number of mental health personnel working, it is suggested to increase the mental health budget to generate more mental health services and employment.",Characteristics of undergraduate and second speciality mental health programmes in Peru: a cross-sectional study,"Garcia-Serna, J., Almeida-Huanca, G., Huarcaya-Victoria, J., Vilela-Estrada, A.L., Zafra-Tanaka, J.H., Villarreal-Zegarra, D.",2023,HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH,21,1,16,,,10,0,10.1186/s12960-023-00805-9,,"[Garcia-Serna, Jackeline; Almeida-Huanca, Guillermo; Vilela-Estrada, Ana Lucia; Villarreal-Zegarra, David] Inst Peruano Orientac Psicol, Lima, Peru; [Zafra-Tanaka, Jessica Hanae] Univ Cient, Escuela Med, Lima, Peru; [Huarcaya-Victoria, Jeff] Univ Privada San Juan Bautista Filial Ica, Escuela Profes Med Humana, Ica, Peru; [Huarcaya-Victoria, Jeff] Hosp Nacl Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen, Dept Psiquiatria, Unidad Psiquiatria Enlace, EsSalud, Lima, Peru; [Villarreal-Zegarra, David] Univ Privada Norbert Wiener, South Amer Ctr Educ & Res Publ Hlth, Lima, Peru",,Education Medical; Education Nursing; Health personnel; Community Mental Health Centers,,Education Medical;Education Nursing;Health personnel;Community Mental Health Centers,davidvillarreal@ipops.pe,,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,,,BMC,,,,36859351,English,HUM RESOUR HEALTH,Article,WoS,Health Care Sciences & Services; Business & Economics,WOS:000941129600002,2-s2.0-85149428151,Peru,ipops.pe,Inst Peruano Orientac Psicol;Univ Cient;Univ Privada San Juan Bautista Filial Ica;Hosp Nacl Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen;Univ Privada Norbert Wiener,"Inst Peruano Orientac Psicol, Peru;Univ Cient, Peru;Univ Privada San Juan Bautista Filial Ica, Peru;Hosp Nacl Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen, Peru;Univ Privada Norbert Wiener, Peru","Garcia-Serna, Jackeline; Almeida-Huanca, Guillermo; Huarcaya-Victoria, Jeff; Vilela-Estrada, Ana Lucia; Zafra-Tanaka, Jessica Hanae; Villarreal-Zegarra, David",,
Is in caws,No,"Sequence-based gene expression data are used to interpret results from functional genomic and proteomics studies. Although more than 300 000 bovine-expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are available in public databases, a more thorough and directed sampling of the expressed genome is needed to identify new transcripts and improve assembly and annotation of existing transcript sequences. Accordingly, we examined the utility of constructing cDNA libraries synthesized by arbitrarily primed RT-PCR of mRNA from tissues not well represented in the publicly available bovine EST database. A total of 33 cDNA libraries were constructed from healthy and infected mammary gland tissues of Brazilian Gir and Holstein cattle. This series of libraries was used to generate 6481 open reading frame-expressed sequence tags (ORESTES) that assembled into 1798 unique sequence elements of which, 1157 did not significantly match sequence assemblies available in the Bos taurus gene index. However, a total of 264 of these 1157 sequence elements aligned with mouse and human expressed sequences demonstrating that ORESTES is an effective resource for discovery of novel expressed sequences in cattle. Furthermore, comparison of the alignment position of bovine ORESTES-derived sequence elements to human gene reference sequences suggested that the priming events for cDNA synthesis more often occurred at the central portion of a transcript, which may have contributed to the relatively high rate of novel sequence discovery.",Characterization of open reading frame-expressed sequence tags generated from Bos indicus and B-taurus mammary gland cDNA libraries,"da Mota, A.F., Sonstegard, T.S., Van Tassell, C.P., Shade, L.L., Matukumalli, L.K., Wood, D.L., Capuco, A.V., Brito, M.A.P., Connor, E.E., Martinez, M.L., Coutinho, L.L.",2004,ANIMAL GENETICS,35,3,,213,219,7,5,10.1111/j.1365-2052.2004.01139.x,,"ARS, USDA, Bovine Funct Genom Lab, Beltsville Agr Res Inst BARC E, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; EMBRAPA, Gado Leite, Natl Dairy Cattle Res Ctr, Bairro Dom Bosco, Juiz de Fora, MG, Brazil; Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, Dept Zootecnia, Lab Anim Biotechnol, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; George Mason Univ, SCS, Manassas, VA USA",,bovine transcriptome; expressed sequence tags; mammary gland,,bovine transcriptome;expressed sequence tags;mammary gland,tads@anri.barc.usda.gov,,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,WILEY,0268-9146,,,15147393,English,ANIM GENET,Article,WoS,Agriculture; Genetics & Heredity,WOS:000221488300008,2-s2.0-2942594005,United States;Brazil,anri.barc.usda.gov,USDA;Gado Leite;ESALQ;SCS,"USDA, United States;Gado Leite, Brazil;ESALQ, Brazil;SCS, United States","da Mota, AF; Sonstegard, TS; Van Tassell, CP; Shade, LL; Matukumalli, LK; Wood, DL; Capuco, AV; Brito, MAP; Connor, EE; Martinez, ML; Coutinho, LL",,
global open source satellite-based . No so health related,No,"The detection of coastal vulnerability to erosion is crucial for decision-making regarding the economy, ecology, health, security, among other issues. Most of the studies gather a large data set about physical and anthropogenic interfer-ence's on the vulnerability of coastal erosion regions around the world. However, for developing nations like Brazil, with extensive shoreline, it is challenging to develop and maintain an in situ infrastructure to offer a systematical scientific data set. In this context, several methods like Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) for monitoring the dynamic behavior of coastal systems require in situ collected data. Therefore, this contribution explores the use of global open source satellite-based indicators to assess coastal vulnerability to erosion at a regional level adopting an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, the data set covers many spheres of the environ-ment like biophysical and social factors, adopting the Pernambuco State's coast, Brazil, as a case study. The results showed the direct relationship between a high level of urbanization and low vegetation with the high coastal vulnera-bility to erosion. PC1 revealed built-up and surface temperature vary inversely to the soil organic carbon and vegetation cover along about 20 km (approximate to 10% of the shoreline extension). The hotspots were in the urban cluster (Paulista, Olinda, Recife, and Jaboatao dos Guararapes), combined with high shoreline change around -2 m/yr. PC2 showed the natural action of wind on wave heights combined with sediment removal and the backshore settlement along 10 km of extension (approximate to 5.5% of the shoreline), with the highly vulnerable sites concentrated in Itamaraca Island and C. S. Agostinho. This approach benefits from the multi-satellite and multi-resolution data sets integration to unravel the statistical influence of each variable able to guide stakeholders.",Characterizing global satellite-based indicators for coastal vulnerability to erosion management as exemplified by a regional level analysis from Northeast Brazil,"Queiroz, H.A.D., Goncalves, R.M., Mishra, M.",2022,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,817,,152849,,,13,1,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152849,,"[de Araujo Queiroz, Heithor Alexandre] Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Baiano IF Baiano, Guanambi, BA, Brazil; [de Araujo Queiroz, Heithor Alexandre; Goncalves, Rodrigo Mikosz] Fed Univ Pernambuco UFPE, Dept Cartog Engn, Geodet Sci & Technol Geoinformat Post Grad Progra, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Mishra, Manoranjan] Berhampur Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management & Geoinformat, Ganjam, Odisha, India",,Coastal vulnerability to erosion; Global indicator; Remotely sensed data set; PCA; Coastal vulnerability index,RISK-ASSESSMENT; SANDY BEACHES; SEA-LEVEL; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; VEGETATION COVER; SOIL-EROSION; INPUT DATA; NDVI; MODEL; INDEX,Coastal vulnerability to erosion;Global indicator;Remotely sensed data set;PCA;Coastal vulnerability index;RISK-ASSESSMENT;SANDY BEACHES;SEA-LEVEL;SPATIAL-RESOLUTION;VEGETATION COVER;SOIL-EROSION;INPUT DATA;NDVI;MODEL;INDEX,rodrigo.mikosz@ufpe.br,,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ELSEVIER,0048-9697,,,35016934,English,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Article,WoS,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000793348100005,2-s2.0-85122952307,Brazil;India,ufpe.br,Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Baiano IF Baiano;Fed Univ Pernambuco UFPE;Berhampur Univ,"Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Baiano IF Baiano, Brazil;Fed Univ Pernambuco UFPE, Brazil;Berhampur Univ, India","de Araujo Queiroz, Heithor Alexandre; Goncalves, Rodrigo Mikosz; Mishra, Manoranjan",,
In USA,No,"There have been many calls for improved detection of zoonoses; research has not yet characterized zoonotic disease detection in the United States, in humans or animals. This research reviewed ""who detects"" zoonotic disease outbreaks and ""how fast"" they are detected. Definitions were operationalized based on existing literature and current practice. An outbreak database was created from publicly available records: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports and ProMed-Mail. Univariate and bivariate statistics-including chi-square tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Dunn's method were used for analysis. From an n = 101, results showed that laboratories (human health) detected 32.7% (n = 33) of the outbreaks; physicians/clinicians (human health) detected 18.8% (n = 19). The median time to was 13 days; mean was 31.7 (range = 0-492). There was a relationship between the type of the entity (laboratory, practitioner, or state agency) and how fast the outbreak was detected; state agencies were slower in detection. There was also a significant relationship between how fast an outbreak was detected and whether the outbreak occurred in multiple regions. This research provides important empirical evidence regarding U.S. zoonotic disease outbreak detection, highlighting the difficulty in rapid detection of multi-state outbreaks and the need for rapid, sensitive diagnostic testing and astute practitioners. © 2014 King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences.",Characterizing zoonotic disease detection in the United States: Who detects zoonotic disease outbreaks & how fast are they detected?,Allen H.A.,2015,Journal of Infection and Public Health,8,2,,194,201,,10,10.1016/j.jiph.2014.09.009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84933673747&doi=10.1016%2fj.jiph.2014.09.009&partnerID=40&md5=ad63d1ace7ca8ff6b285bac6c4e0c00f,"The George Washington University, 805 21st St NW, Suite 601, Washington, DC, United States; The Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University, 2160 College of Veterinary Medicine, Ames, IA, United States","Allen, H.A., The George Washington University, 805 21st St NW, Suite 601, Washington, DC, United States, The Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University, 2160 College of Veterinary Medicine, Ames, IA, United States",Detection; Disease outbreaks; Public health; Zoonoses,anaplasmosis; animal model; anthrax; Article; avian influenza; bivariate analysis; blastomycosis; bovine spongiform encephalopathy; bovine tuberculosis; brucellosis; campylobacteriosis; chi square test; coccidioidomycosis; controlled study; Creutzfeldt Jakob disease; Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever; cryptococcosis; data base; diagnostic test; Dunn method; Eastern equine encephalitis; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; ehrlichiosis; empirical research; epidemic; Escherichia coli infection; glanders; Hantavirus infection; health care policy; histoplasmosis; human; influenza A; Japanese encephalitis; Kruskal Wallis test; laboratory test; Lassa fever; leishmaniasis; leptospirosis; Lyme disease; major clinical study; malaria; Marburg hemorrhagic fever; monkeypox; morbidity; mortality; Newcastle disease; nonhuman; ornithosis; physician; plague; priority journal; public health; Q fever; rabies; Rift Valley fever; Rocky Mountain spotted fever; salmonellosis; sensitivity analysis; St. Louis encephalitis; statistical analysis; trichinosis; tularemia; United States; univariate analysis; Venezuelan equine encephalitis; West Nile fever; Western equine encephalitis; zoonosis; animal; epidemic; sentinel surveillance; time; Zoonoses; Animals; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Sentinel Surveillance; Time Factors; United States; Zoonoses,Detection;Disease outbreaks;Public health;Zoonoses;anaplasmosis;animal model;anthrax;Article;avian influenza;bivariate analysis;blastomycosis;bovine spongiform encephalopathy;bovine tuberculosis;brucellosis;campylobacteriosis;chi square test;coccidioidomycosis;controlled study;Creutzfeldt Jakob disease;Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever;cryptococcosis;data base;diagnostic test;Dunn method;Eastern equine encephalitis;Ebola hemorrhagic fever;ehrlichiosis;empirical research;epidemic;Escherichia coli infection;glanders;Hantavirus infection;health care policy;histoplasmosis;human;influenza A;Japanese encephalitis;Kruskal Wallis test;laboratory test;Lassa fever;leishmaniasis;leptospirosis;Lyme disease;major clinical study;malaria;Marburg hemorrhagic fever;monkeypox;morbidity;mortality;Newcastle disease;nonhuman;ornithosis;physician;plague;priority journal;Q fever;rabies;Rift Valley fever;Rocky Mountain spotted fever;salmonellosis;sensitivity analysis;St. Louis encephalitis;statistical analysis;trichinosis;tularemia;United States;univariate analysis;Venezuelan equine encephalitis;West Nile fever;Western equine encephalitis;zoonosis;animal;sentinel surveillance;time;Animals;Humans;Time Factors,"Allen, H.A.; The Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University, 2160 College of Veterinary MedicineUnited States",,,,,,Elsevier Ltd,18760341,,,25488822,English,J.

"Internationally registered trials recruiting patients in Argentina were found through clincialtrials.gov and the International Clinical Trial Registration Platform (ICTRP) and compared with publically available clinical trials registered through the National Administration of Drugs, Foods, and Medical Devices (ANMAT)",Yes,"Objective: To review and analyze the regulatory framework of clinical trial registration, use of existing tools (publicly accessible national/international registration databases), and users' perspectives to identify possible barriers to registration compliance by sponsors and researchers in Argentina. Methods: Internationally registered trials recruiting patients in Argentina were found through clincialtrials.gov and the International Clinical Trial Registration Platform (ICTRP) and compared with publically available clinical trials registered through the National Administration of Drugs, Foods, and Medical Devices (ANMAT). A questionnaire addressing hypothesized attitudinal, knowledge-related, idiomatic, technical, economic, and regulatory barriers that could discourage or impede registration of clinical trials was developed, and semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with a purposively selected sample of researchers (investigators, sponsors, and monitors) in Argentina. Results: A response rate of 74.3% (n = 29) was achieved, and 27 interviews were ultimately used for analysis. Results suggested that the high proportion of foreign-sponsored or multinational trials (64.8% of all protocols approved by ANMAT from 1994-2006) may contribute to a communication gap between locally based investigators and foreign-based administrative officials. A lack of knowledge about available international registration tools and limited awareness of the importance of registration were also identified as limiting factors for local investigators and sponsors. Conclusions: To increase compliance and promote clinical trial registration in Argentina, national health authorities, sponsors, and local investigators could take the following steps: implement a grassroots educational campaign to improve clinical trial regulation, support local investigator-sponsor-initiated clinical trials, and/or encourage local and regional scientific journal compliance with standards from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) and/or the World Association of Medical Editors (WAME).","Clinical trial regulation in Argentina: Overview and analysis of regulatory framework, use of existing tools, and researchers' perspectives to identify potential barriers","White L., Ortiz Z., Cuervo L.G., Reveiz L.",2011,Revista Panamericana de Salud Publica/Pan American Journal of Public Health,30,5,,445,452,,8,10.1590/S1020-49892011001100007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84856029038&doi=10.1590%2fS1020-49892011001100007&partnerID=40&md5=71326b2dfc62ef328779ada55f49b95e,"University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States; Research and Training, Instituto de Investigaciónes Epidemiológicas, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Public Policies and Research for Health, Health Systems Based on Primary Health Care (HSS), Pan American Health Organization, Washington, DC, United States","White, L., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States; Ortiz, Z., Research and Training, Instituto de Investigaciónes Epidemiológicas, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Cuervo, L.G., Public Policies and Research for Health, Health Systems Based on Primary Health Care (HSS), Pan American Health Organization, Washington, DC, United States; Reveiz, L., Public Policies and Research for Health, Health Systems Based on Primary Health Care (HSS), Pan American Health Organization, Washington, DC, United States",Argentina; Clinical trials as topic; Publication bias; Registries,administrative system; attitudinal survey; compliance; educational development; financial provision; international cooperation; international organization; medicine; questionnaire survey; regulatory framework; research program; Argentina,Argentina;Clinical trials as topic;Publication bias;Registries;administrative system;attitudinal survey;compliance;educational development;financial provision;international cooperation;international organization;medicine;questionnaire survey;regulatory framework;research program,"White, L.; University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States; email: law2yd@virginia.edu",,,,,,Pan American Health Organization,10204989,,RPSPF,,English,Rev.

The focus is not south america,No,"Introduction Clinical trials are the back bone for evidence-based practice (EBP) and recently EBP has been considered the best source of treatment strategies available. Clinical trial registries serve as databases of clinical trials. As regards to dentistry in specific data on the number of clinical trials and their quality is lacking. Hence, the present study was envisaged. Method Clinical trials registered in WHO-ICTRP (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/AdvSearch.aspx) in dental specialties were considered. The details assessed from the collected trials include: Type of sponsors; Health condition; Recruitment status; Study design; randomization, method of randomization and allocation concealment; Single or multi-centric; Retrospective or prospective registration; and Publication status in case of completed studies. Results A total of 197 trials were identified. Maximum trials were from United States (n = 30) and United Kingdom (n = 38). Seventy six trials were registered in Clinical Trials.gov, 54 from International Standards of Reporting Clinical Trials, 13 each from Australia and New Zealand Trial Register and Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials, 10 from German Clinical Trial Registry, eight each from Brazilian Clinical Trial Registry and Nederland's Trial Register, seven from Japan Clinical Trial Registry, six from Clinical Trial Registry of India and two from Hong Kong Clinical Trial Registry. A total of 78.7% studies were investigator-initiated and 64% were completed while 3% were terminated. Nearly four-fifths of the registered trials (81.7%) were interventional studies of which randomized were the large majority (94.4%) with 63.2% being open label, 20.4% using single blinding technique and 16.4% were doubled blinded. Conclusion The number, methodology and the characteristics of clinical trials in dentistry have been noted to be poor especially in terms of being conducted multi-centrically, employing blinding and the method for randomization and allocation concealment. More emphasis has to be laid down on the quality of trials being conducted in order to provide justice in the name of EBP. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Clinical Trials in Dentistry: A Cross-sectional Analysis of World Health Organization-International Clinical Trial Registry Platform,"Sivaramakrishnan G., Sridharan K.",2016,Journal of Evidence-Based Dental Practice,16,2,,90,95,,2,10.1016/j.jebdp.2016.03.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991063297&doi=10.1016%2fj.jebdp.2016.03.002&partnerID=40&md5=d477792638c75982ebdb31cd7fda8bef,"Department of Oral Health, College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Fiji National University, Hoodless House, Brown StreetSuva, Fiji; Department of Pharmacology, Fiji National University, Extension StreetSuva, Fiji","Sivaramakrishnan, G., Department of Oral Health, College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Fiji National University, Hoodless House, Brown StreetSuva, Fiji; Sridharan, K., Department of Pharmacology, Fiji National University, Extension StreetSuva, Fiji",CAM; Dental research; Evidence based dentistry,Australia and New Zealand; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dental research; dentistry; evidence based practice center; Hong Kong; human; India; intervention study; Japan; justice; publication; randomization; randomized controlled trial; register; single blind procedure; study design; tooth; United Kingdom; United States; world health organization; Australia; Brazil; clinical trial (topic); cross-sectional study; evidence based dentistry; Iran; methodology; New Zealand; prospective study; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; Australia; Brazil; Clinical Trials as Topic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Evidence-Based Dentistry; Hong Kong; Humans; India; Iran; Japan; New Zealand; Prospective Studies; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Registries; Research Design; Retrospective Studies; United Kingdom,CAM;Dental research;Evidence based dentistry;Australia and New Zealand;clinical article;clinical trial;controlled clinical trial;controlled study;cross-sectional study;dentistry;evidence based practice center;Hong Kong;human;India;intervention study;Japan;justice;publication;randomization;randomized controlled trial;register;single blind procedure;study design;tooth;United Kingdom;United States;world health organization;Australia;Brazil;clinical trial (topic);Iran;methodology;New Zealand;prospective study;randomized controlled trial (topic);retrospective study;Clinical Trials as Topic;Cross-Sectional Studies;Evidence-Based Dentistry;Humans;Prospective Studies;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Registries;Research Design;Retrospective Studies,"Sivaramakrishnan, G.; Department of Oral Health, Hoodless House, Brown Street, Fiji",,,,,,Mosby Inc.,15323382,,,27449835,English,J.

Review,No,"The present manuscript discussed some relevant aspects related to private sponsored clinical trials in dentistry. For decades, the academy has been the major responsible for research in Brazil. Distant from the trade sector, academic research has not always provided clear benefits to society. A key aspect of making benefits clearer is the process of scientific knowledge transference to decision-makers, which is, in fact, the ground of evidence-based dentistry. Although private sponsoring of clinical research seems to be part of the research progress of the business rates, investment in Brazil is lower than those observed in other countries. It is particularly important to understand that instead of creating its own rules, dentistry imported the highquality standards originally designed for pharmaceutical studies. Therefore, it is critical to understand the original rules and how dental items are classified by regulatory agencies. In fact, knowledge about international and local regulation is a basic assumption in industry-sponsored research. Despite globalization, the identification of industry-sponsored studies through open access databases is still very hard and time-demanding. A common concern when conducting industry-sponsored trials is study biases. Fortunately, many relevant organizations, academic and industry groups, have been working seriously against that. Finally, for less experienced researchers, many aspects related to industry-sponsored studies-such as confidentiality, authorship, budget-are deeply discussed until a final version of the trial agreement can be written and signed, protecting all sides. In short, the scenario should be improved, but it already represents a nice opportunity for dental research. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Hematologia e Hemoterapia.",Clinical trials sponsored by industry and other private organizations,"Cortelli S.C., Costa F.O., Lousana G., Quintairos P.C.R., Francisconi-Dos-Rios L.F., Cortelli J.R.",2020,Brazilian Oral Research,34,,77,,,,0,10.1590/1807-3107BOR-2020.VOL34.0077,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089408364&doi=10.1590%2f1807-3107BOR-2020.VOL34.0077&partnerID=40&md5=d323c48ac7ef12d1bab6a96bedb5a4b3,"Universidade de Taubaté-Unitau, Office of Graduate Studies and Scientific Affairs, Taubaté, SP, Brazil; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais-UFMG, School of Dentistry, Periodontics Department, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; Invitare Clinical Research, São Paulo, SP, Brazil; Universidade de São Paulo-USP, School of Dentistry, Department of Operative Dentistry, São Paulo, SP, Brazil","Cortelli, S.C., Universidade de Taubaté-Unitau, Office of Graduate Studies and Scientific Affairs, Taubaté, SP, Brazil; Costa, F.O., Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais-UFMG, School of Dentistry, Periodontics Department, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; Lousana, G., Invitare Clinical Research, São Paulo, SP, Brazil; Quintairos, P.C.R., Universidade de Taubaté-Unitau, Office of Graduate Studies and Scientific Affairs, Taubaté, SP, Brazil; Francisconi-Dos-Rios, L.F., Universidade de São Paulo-USP, School of Dentistry, Department of Operative Dentistry, São Paulo, SP, Brazil; Cortelli, J.R., Universidade de Taubaté-Unitau, Office of Graduate Studies and Scientific Affairs, Taubaté, SP, Brazil",Clinical trial; Industry; Private sector; Provider-Sponsored organizations; Support of research,article; Brazil; budget; clinical research; confidentiality; dental research; dentistry; health care delivery; human; investment; private sector; transference; writing; clinical trial (topic); industry; Brazil; Clinical Trials as Topic; Industry,Clinical trial;Industry;Private sector;Provider-Sponsored organizations;Support of research;article;Brazil;budget;clinical research;confidentiality;dental research;dentistry;health care delivery;human;investment;transference;writing;clinical trial (topic);Clinical Trials as Topic,"Cortelli, S.C.; Universidade de Taubaté-Unitau, Brazil; email: cavalcacortelli@uol.com.br",,,,,,Sociedade Brasileira de Hematologia e Hemoterapia,18068324,,,32785487,English,Braz.

"study using the Integrated Social Protection Information System database from the Colombian Ministry of Health, the unique official database in the country",Yes,"Objectives: This study aims to describe the incidence of ocular involvement in patients with toxoplasmo-sis and describe the sociodemographic characteristics by age, sex, and region in Colombia, based on the National Health Registry of data between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using the Integrated Social Protection Information Sys-tem database from the Colombian Ministry of Health, the unique official database in the country. We used the International Classification of Diseases for all codes of toxoplasmosis with a specific filter for ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) from 2015 to 2019 to estimate the incidence and the demographic status of the disease in Colombia.Results: During the 5 years of study, the crude unadjusted incidence of OT was 42.02 (Confidence In-terval 30.29-56.19) cases in 1,0 0 0 patients with toxoplasmosis per year, showing a significant increase of incidence when comparing the year 2019 to the year 2015. There was a predominance of female patients (58% of the cases). The distribution by age shows an increase in cases of the disease in subjects aged 15 to 49 years (65.2%). The geographic analysis showed a higher proportion of cases in the Andean region, followed by the Pacific and the Atlantic regions.Conclusion: This is the first study that determines the epidemiological characteristics of OT based on a National Health database in Colombia, showing a public health problem and evidencing the neediness of solidifying preventive and screening strategies in the Colombian population.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Is in ColUmbia XD,No,"Background: COVID-19 has threatened the health of tens of millions of people all over the world. Massive research efforts have been made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilization of clinical data can accelerate these research efforts to combat the pandemic since important characteristics of the patients are often found by examining the clinical data. Publicly accessible clinical data on COVID-19, however, remain limited despite the immediate need. Objective: To provide shareable clinical data to catalyze COVID-19 research, we present Columbia Open Health Data for COVID-19 Research (COHD-COVID), a publicly accessible database providing clinical concept prevalence, clinical concept co-occurrence, and clinical symptom prevalence for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. COHD-COVID also provides data on hospitalized patients with influenza and general hospitalized patients as comparator cohorts. Methods: The data used in COHD-COVID were obtained from NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center’s electronic health records database. Condition, drug, and procedure concepts were obtained from the visits of identified patients from the cohorts. Rare concepts were excluded, and the true concept counts were perturbed using Poisson randomization to protect patient privacy. Concept prevalence, concept prevalence ratio, concept co-occurrence, and symptom prevalence were calculated using the obtained concepts. Results: Concept prevalence and concept prevalence ratio analyses showed the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 cohorts, confirming the well-known characteristics of COVID-19 (eg, acute lower respiratory tract infection and cough). The concepts related to the well-known characteristics of COVID-19 recorded high prevalence and high prevalence ratio in the COVID-19 cohort compared to the hospitalized influenza cohort and general hospitalized cohort. Concept co-occurrence analyses showed potential associations between specific concepts. In case of acute lower respiratory tract infection in the COVID-19 cohort, a high co-occurrence ratio was obtained with COVID-19–related concepts and commonly used drugs (eg, disease due to coronavirus and acetaminophen). Symptom prevalence analysis indicated symptom-level characteristics of the cohorts and confirmed that well-known symptoms of COVID-19 (eg, fever, cough, and dyspnea) showed higher prevalence than the hospitalized influenza cohort and the general hospitalized cohort. Conclusions: We present COHD-COVID, a publicly accessible database providing useful clinical data for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, hospitalized patients with influenza, and general hospitalized patients. We expect COHD-COVID to provide researchers and clinicians quantitative measures of COVID-19–related clinical features to better understand and combat the pandemic. ©Junghwan Lee, Jae Hyun Kim, Cong Liu, George Hripcsak, Karthik Natarajan, Casey Ta, Chunhua Weng.",Columbia open health data for COVID-19 research: Database analysis,"Lee J., Kim J.H., Liu C., Hripcsak G., Natarajan K., Ta C., Weng C.",2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,23,9,e31122,,,,1,10.2196/31122,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116514223&doi=10.2196%2f31122&partnerID=40&md5=d3a9dfbabab1e480f223250e4df85e17,"Columbia University, New York, NY, United States","Lee, J., Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Kim, J.H., Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Liu, C., Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Hripcsak, G., Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Natarajan, K., Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Ta, C., Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Weng, C., Columbia University, New York, NY, United States",Access; Cohort; COVID-19; Data; Data science; Database; Electronic health record; Open data; Prevalence; Research; Symptom,"ceftriaxone; enoxaparin; glucose; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; insulin lispro; paracetamol; potassium chloride; sennoside; sodium chloride; acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; acute kidney failure; adult; Article; clinical feature; clinical research; cohort analysis; Colombia; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; data analysis; dyspnea; essential hypertension; female; fever; health data; hospital patient; human; hypoxemia; influenza; lower respiratory tract infection; major clinical study; male; pandemic; prevalence; prevalence ratio; quantitative analysis; respiratory tract disease; symptomatology; virus pneumonia; factual database; influenza; COVID-19; Databases, Factual; Humans; Influenza, Human; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","Access;Cohort;COVID-19;Data;Data science;Database;Electronic health record;Open data;Prevalence;Research;Symptom;ceftriaxone;enoxaparin;glucose;heparin;hydroxychloroquine;insulin lispro;paracetamol;potassium chloride;sennoside;sodium chloride;acute hypoxemic respiratory failure;acute kidney failure;adult;Article;clinical feature;clinical research;cohort analysis;Colombia;coronavirus disease 2019;coughing;data analysis;dyspnea;essential hypertension;female;fever;health data;hospital patient;human;hypoxemia;influenza;lower respiratory tract infection;major clinical study;male;pandemic;prevalence ratio;quantitative analysis;respiratory tract disease;symptomatology;virus pneumonia;factual database;Databases, Factual;Humans;Influenza, Human;Pandemics;SARS-CoV-2","Weng, C.; Columbia University Ph-20, 622 W 168, United States; email: cw2384@cumc.columbia.edu",,,,,,JMIR Publications Inc.,14388871,,,34543225,English,J.

Review,No,"Objective. To identify the evidence regarding the co-management of tuberculosis and diabetes available in the literature for the Latin-American context. Method. An integrative literature review was performed in the LILACS, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. The search strategy employed the terms “tuberculosis”, “diabetes mellitus,” and “integrated management.” Open access articles reporting studies performed in Latin America, published from 2011 to 2017 in English, Spanish or Portuguese were included. The following information was collected: authors, design, sample, main results, country of study, and year of publication. The studies were also classified according to level of evidence. Results. Twenty studies were included, 60% of which had low level of evidence (level IV). According to these studies, patients with diabetes are at increased risk for tuberculosis, especially those with poor glycemic control. In addition, tuberculosis-diabetes patients have delayed sputum conversion and higher probability of treatment failure and death. The prevalence of tuberculosis-diabetes comorbidity is higher in males. Information about tuberculosis and diabetes is poorly recorded or absent in medical charts or electronic files. The management of tuberculosis-diabetes comorbidity is associated with high cost. The multidisciplinary health care team plays a crucial role in the prevention and promotion of health at all levels of care. Conclusion. Bidirectional screening of tuberculosis-diabetes may facilitate the control of these disorders, especially in developing countries and endemic tuberculosis areas. © 2018 Pan American Health Organization.

"They created an open survey, but not an open dataset",No,"Background Measurement of the global burden of disease with disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) requires disability weights that quantify health losses for all non-fatal consequences of disease and injury. There has been extensive debate about a range of conceptual and methodological issues concerning the definition and measurement of these weights. Our primary objective was a comprehensive re-estimation of disability weights for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 through a large-scale empirical investigation in which judgments about health losses associated with many causes of disease and injury were elicited from the general public in diverse communities through a new, standardised approach. Methods We surveyed respondents in two ways: household surveys of adults aged 18 years or older (face-to-face interviews in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Peru, and Tanzania; telephone interviews in the USA) between Oct 28, 2009, and June 23, 2010; and an open-access web-based survey between July 26, 2010, and May 16, 2011. The surveys used paired comparison questions, in which respondents considered two hypothetical individuals with different, randomly selected health states and indicated which person they regarded as healthier. The web survey added questions about population health equivalence, which compared the overall health benefits of different life-saving or disease-prevention programmes. We analysed paired comparison responses with probit regression analysis on all 220 unique states in the study. We used results from the population health equivalence responses to anchor the results from the paired comparisons on the disability weight scale from 0 (implying no loss of health) to 1 (implying a health loss equivalent to death). Additionally, we compared new disability weights with those used in WHO's most recent update of the Global Burden of Disease Study for 2004. Findings 13 902 individuals participated in household surveys and 16 328 in the web survey. Analysis of paired comparison responses indicated a high degree of consistency across surveys: correlations between individual survey results and results from analysis of the pooled dataset were 0.9 or higher in all surveys except in Bangladesh (r=0.75). Most of the 220 disability weights were located on the mild end of the severity scale, with 58 (26%) having weights below 0.05. Five (11%) states had weights below 0.01, such as mild anaemia, mild hearing or vision loss, and secondary infertility. The health states with the highest disability weights were acute schizophrenia (0.76) and severe multiple sclerosis (0.71). We identified a broad pattern of agreement between the old and new weights (r=0.70), particularly in the moderate-to-severe range. However, in the mild range below 0.2, many states had significantly lower weights in our study than previously. Interpretation This study represents the most extensive empirical effort as yet to measure disability weights. By contrast with the popular hypothesis that disability assessments vary widely across samples with different cultural environments, we have reported strong evidence of highly consistent results.",Common values in assessing health outcomes from disease and injury: disability weights measurement study for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010,"Salomon, J.A., Vos, T., Hogan, D.R., Gagnon, M., Naghavi, M., Mokdad, A., Begum, N., Shah, R., Karyana, M., Kosen, S., Farje, M.R., Moncada, G., Dutta, A., Sazawal, S., Dyer, A., Seiler, J., Aboyans, V., Baker, L., Baxter, A., Benjamin, E.J., Bhalla, K., Bin Abdulhak, A., Blyth, F., Bourne, R., Braithwaite, T., Brooks, P., Brugha, T.S., Bryan-Hancock, C., Buchbinder, R., Burney, P., Calabria, B., Chen, H.L., Chugh, S.S., Cooley, R., Criqui, M.H., Cross, M., Dabhadkar, K.C., Dahodwala, N., Davis, A., Degenhardt, L., Diaz-Torne, C., Dorsey, E.R., Driscoll, T., Edmond, K., Elbaz, A., Ezzati, M., Feigin, V., Ferri, C.P., Flaxman, A.D., Flood, L., Fransen, M., Fuse, K., Gabbe, B.J., Gillum, R.F., Haagsma, J., Harrison, J.E., Havmoeller, R., Hay, R.J., Hel-Baqui, A., Hoek, H.W., Hoffman, H., Hogeland, E., Hoy, D., Jarvis, D., Karthikeyan, G., Knowlton, L.M., Lathlean, T., Leasher, J.L., Lim, S.S., Lipshultz, S.E., Lopez, A.D., Lozano, R., Lyons, R., Malekzadeh, R., Marcenes, W., March, L., Margolis, D.J., McGill, N., McGrath, J., Mensah, G.A., Meyer, A.C., Michaud, C., Moran, A., Mori, R., Murdoch, M.E., Naldi, L., Newton, C.R., Norman, R., Omer, S.B., Osborne, R., Pearce, N., Perez-Ruiz, F., Perico, N., Pesudovs, K., Phillips, D., Pourmalek, F., Prince, M., Rehm, J.T., Remuzzi, G., Richardson, K., Room, R., Saha, S., Sampson, U., Sanchez-Riera, L., Segui-Gomez, M., Shahraz, S., Shibuya, K., Singh, D., Sliwa, K., Smith, E., Soerjomataram, I., Steiner, T., Stolk, W.A., Stovner, L.J., Sudfeld, C., Taylor, H.R., Tleyjeh, I.M., van der Werf, M.J., Watson, W.L., Weatherall, D.J., Weintraub, R., Weisskopf, M.G., Whiteford, H., Wilkinson, J.D., Woolf, A.D., Zheng, Z.J., Murray, C.J.L.",2012,LANCET,380,9859,,2129,2143,15,933,10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61680-8,,"[Salomon, Joshua A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Knowlton, Lisa Marie] Harvard Univ, Harvard Humanitarian Initiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Vos, Theo; Lopez, Alan D.; Norman, Rosana] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Baxter, Amanda; Saha, Sukanta; Whiteford, Harvey] Univ Queensland, Queensland Ctr Mental Hlth Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [McGrath, John] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Naghavi, Mohsen; Mokdad, Ali; Baker, Lesley; Cooley, Rebecca; Flaxman, Abraham D.; Lim, Stephen S.; Lozano, Rafael; Phillips, David; Murray, Christopher J.

Review,No,"Abstract This study discusses the reorganization of the Community Health Workers (CHWs) work process as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, considering its importance as a link between the community and the health services in the field of basic care. The literature review co-mes from the following databases: Virtual Health Library, Scientific Electronic Library Online, and the Brazilian Scientific Publications Portal databases in open access and document review of te-chnical and normative notes from the Municipal Health Secretariats in Brazil. The analysis was based on the premises of Primary Health Care and on the axes of the CHW work, especially cultural competence and community orientation, aiming to discuss the changes introduced in this work regarding the following aspects: 1) health teams support, 2) use of telehealth, and 3) health edu-cation. This study concluded that the Covid-19 pandemic demanded reorganization of the work process and assistance flows in the field of basic care. In order for the CHW to continue developing their activities it is necessary to guarantee decent working conditions, training and continuing edu-cation, including the concern about the possible discontinuity of other care needed to ensure the population health care in the territory. © 2020, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

Review,No,"The Coronavirus pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has significantly impacted human health and the economy, especially in countries struggling with financial resources for medical testing and treatment, such as Brazil’s case, the third most affected country by the pandemic. In this scenario, machine learning techniques have been heavily employed to analyze different types of medical data, and aid decision making, offering a low-cost alternative. Due to the urgency to fight the pandemic, a massive amount of works are applying machine learning approaches to clinical data, including complete blood count (CBC) tests, which are among the most widely available medical tests. In this work, we review the most employed machine learning classifiers for CBC data, together with popular sampling methods to deal with the class imbalance. Additionally, we describe and critically analyze three publicly available Brazilian COVID-19 CBC datasets and evaluate the performance of eight classifiers and five sampling techniques on the selected datasets. Our work provides a panorama of which classifier and sampling methods provide the best results for different relevant metrics and discuss their impact on future analyses. The metrics and algorithms are introduced in a way to aid newcomers to the field. Finally, the panorama discussed here can significantly benefit the comparison of the results of new ML algorithms. © Copyright 2021 Dorn et al.",Comparison of machine learning techniques to handle imbalanced COVID-19 CBC datasets,"Dorn M., Grisci B.I., Narloch P.H., Feltes B.C., Avila E., Kahmann A., Alho C.S.",2021,PeerJ Computer Science,7,,,1,34,,3,10.7717/peerj-cs.670,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116509693&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj-cs.670&partnerID=40&md5=67e1e48d314dbfea2cbf86de624715de,"Institute of Informatics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; Center of Biotechnology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; Forensic Science, National Institute of Science and Technology, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; Department of Genetics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; School of Health and Life Sciences, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; Institute of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, Federal University of Rio Grande, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil","Dorn, M., Institute of Informatics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, Center of Biotechnology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, Forensic Science, National Institute of Science and Technology, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; Grisci, B.I., Institute of Informatics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; Narloch, P.H., Institute of Informatics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; Feltes, B.C., Institute of Informatics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, Department of Genetics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; Avila, E., Forensic Science, National Institute of Science and Technology, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, School of Health and Life Sciences, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; Kahmann, A., Institute of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, Federal University of Rio Grande, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; Alho, C.S., Forensic Science, National Institute of Science and Technology, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, School of Health and Life Sciences, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Covid; Data mining; Hemogram; Imbalanced datasets; Machine learning,Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision making; Diseases; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; SARS; Complete blood counts; Coronaviruses; Covid; Financial resources; Hemogram; Human health; Imbalanced dataset; Machine learning techniques; Medical data; Sampling method; Coronavirus,Covid;Data mining;Hemogram;Imbalanced datasets;Machine learning;Classification (of information);Decision making;Diseases;Learning algorithms;SARS;Complete blood counts;Coronaviruses;Financial resources;Human health;Imbalanced dataset;Machine learning techniques;Medical data;Sampling method;Coronavirus,"Dorn, M.; Institute of Informatics, Brazil; email: mdorn@inf.ufrgs.br",,,,,,PeerJ Inc.,23765992,,,,English,PeerJ Comput.

database from the Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (DATASUS),Yes,"Acute appendicitis is the leading cause of abdominal emergency surgery worldwide and appendectomy continues to be the definitive treatment of choice. This cost-effectiveness analysis evaluates laparoscopic versus open appendectomies performed in public health services in the state of Bahia (Brazil). We conducted a retrospective observational study using the database from the Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (DATASUS). Available data on appendectomies between 2008 and 2019 were included, and we evaluated the temporal trend of hospital admissions, procedure-related mortality rates, length of stay, and costs. Statistical analysis was performed using the R-software (R Foundation, v.4.0.3) and the BioEstat software (IMDS, v. 5.3), considering p<0.05 as significant. During 2008-2019, 53,024 appendectomies were performed in the public health services in Bahia, of which 94.9% were open surgeries. The open technique was associated with a higher mortality rate (4.9/1,000 procedures; p<0.05) and a higher risk of death (RR=4.5; p<0.05) compared to laparoscopy (1.1/1,000 procedures). Laparoscopic appendectomy (median of 2.7 days) had a shorter length of stay compared to laparotomy (median of 4.15 days) (p<0.05). There was no difference in the medians of costs nor hospital services, per procedure (p=0.08 and p=0.08, respectively). Laparoscopic professional median costs were higher by US$ 1.39 (p<0.05). Minimally invasive surgery for appendicitis is a safe and efficacious procedure in Brazilian public health care services, as it provides advantages over the open method (including lower procedure-related mortality rate and earlier discharges), and it did not imply higher expenses for public service budgets in the state of Bahia. © 2021, Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes.

Review,No,"Working in coal mines, despite all achievements of modern science and technology, still remains among the most dangerous occupations to the health. The review of researches about the chromosomal damage in coal miners was performed. We searched information in the following databases - PubMed, http://www.sciencedirect.com and in the electronic library http://elibrary.ru with the use of the search strategy adopted in the Cochrane Collaboration. Inclusion criteria were: 1) randomized, controlled original researches; 2) researches performed in 1993-2016 where coal miners were the object of the study; 3) articles described chromosomal aberrations (CAs), micronuclei (MN), sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), DNA comets as biomarkers of the exposure. Exclusion criteria were other methods of the assessment of DNA damage; lack of data on the type of mines or coal mines/open-cast mines (uranium, tin, etc.); lack of access to the full text in Russian or English. As a result of the search 12 articles met selection criteria and showed a chromosomal damage in miners were selected. The results of researches performed in different countries (Russia, Turkey, Brazil, Colombia, Netherlands, Peru and India) demonstrate the increased frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in employees of coal mining industry. Damages are accumulated in cells of different types (buccal epithelium and lymphocytes) and can be detected by methods of the assessment of CAs, SCE, MN and DNA comet assay that indicating the complex basis of genotoxicants. The results of the analysis of the relationship between the cytogenetic markers, age and length of service are contradictory. The formation of occupational pulmonary diseases is accompanied by an additional induction of cytogenetic damage. In general, the analysis confirmed the high genotoxic risk of working conditions in underground as well as open-cast miners. © 2017 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

They created their own database that updates every month.Data reconciliation rules based on expert knowledge were defined and applied to the heterogeneous data provided by the existing malaria surveillance systems of both countries,Yes,"Background: Cross-border malaria is a significant obstacle to achieving malaria control and elimination worldwide. Objective: This study aimed to build a cross-border surveillance system that can make comparable and qualified data available to all parties involved in malaria control between French Guiana and Brazil. Methods: Data reconciliation rules based on expert knowledge were defined and applied to the heterogeneous data provided by the existing malaria surveillance systems of both countries. Visualization dashboards were designed to facilitate progressive data exploration, analysis, and interpretation. Dedicated advanced open source and robust software solutions were chosen to facilitate solution sharing and reuse. Results: A database gathering the harmonized data on cross-border malaria epidemiology is updated monthly with new individual malaria cases from both countries. Online dashboards permit a progressive and user-friendly visualization of raw data and epidemiological indicators, in the form of time series, maps, and data quality indexes. The monitoring system was shown to be able to identify changes in time series that are related to control actions, as well as differentiated changes according to space and to population subgroups. Conclusions: This cross-border monitoring tool could help produce new scientific evidence on cross-border malaria dynamics, implementing cross-border cooperation for malaria control and elimination, and can be quickly adapted to other cross-border contexts. ©Raphael Saldanha, Émilie Mosnier, Christovam Barcellos, Aurel Carbunar, Christophe Charron, Jean-Christophe Desconnets, Basma Guarmit, Margarete Do Socorro Mendonça Gomes, Théophile Mandon, Anapaula Martins Mendes, Paulo César Peiter, Lise Musset, Alice Sanna, Benoît Van Gastel, Emmanuel Roux.

"Just talks about temperature, I don't know if is so related with health",No,"The occurrence of very high temperatures (hot extremes) is often linked with negative impacts in human health, natural ecosystems and the economy (e.g., energy, water supply and agriculture). Studies have invariably shown that the intensity and frequency of hot extremes will increase in the future thus increasing their associated risks. While much progress has been made in quantifying and understanding hot temperature extremes and their future changes, there are still open questions. This paper focusses on the sources of hot extremes and their changes by applying a simple and unambiguous methodology that describes daily hot extremes as the superposition of four well known physical terms that include information on the annual mean temperature, the amplitude of the annual cycle, the diurnal temperature range and the local temperature anomaly on the day of the extreme. The methodology was applied to 30-year daily temperature records from 6 observation-based datasets and 31 atmosphere-ocean global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The comparison between observed and simulated hot extremes shows a remarkably consistent picture where most CMIP5 models overestimate the term describing the local temperature extreme anomaly over most regions of the globe regardless of the observed dataset considered. Simultaneously, CMIP5 models show a systematic cold bias in the annual mean temperature and in the diurnal temperature range terms leading to substantial error compensation over some regions. This prompted us to define a new error estimator as the sum of errors in individual terms that appears to be much more effective at characterising model's performance compared to the traditional bias estimator. The assessment of future changes in hot extremes shows that changes are dominated by changes in annual mean temperatures with varying contributions from the other terms that strongly depend on the specific region being considered. Western Europe appears as a hot spot for extreme temperature changes (increases of (similar to)8 degrees C by the end of the century) due to significant contributions from all decomposition terms including the summer mean anomaly, the diurnal temperature range and the daily extreme anomaly. Tropical South America also appears as a hot spot for extreme temperature changes (increases of (similar to)7 degrees C) largely due to an increase in the daily extreme anomaly term (explaining about 30% of the full change) making this region one of the most sensitive regions in the world in terms of hot extremes. The analysis reveals that the separation of future changes according to terms describing mean, variability and tails is very sensitive to the specific way the mean component is defined including assumptions about stationarity.",Contribution of mean climate to hot temperature extremes for present and future climates,"Di Luca, A., de Elia, R., Bador, M., Argueso, D.",2020,WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES,28,,100255,,,16,19,10.1016/j.wace.2020.100255,,"[Di Luca, Alejandro; Bador, Margot] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [de Elia, Ramon] Serv Meteorol Nacl, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Argueso, Daniel] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Phys, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",,Future changes; Climate extremes; Model evaluation; Temperature decomposition; Extreme anomaly; Stationarity,HEAT WAVES; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; RECORD-BREAKING; CMIP5; INDEXES; MODEL; AMPLIFICATION; AUSTRALIA; WEATHER; IMPACT,Future changes;Climate extremes;Model evaluation;Temperature decomposition;Extreme anomaly;Stationarity;HEAT WAVES;PRECIPITATION EXTREMES;RECORD-BREAKING;CMIP5;INDEXES;MODEL;AMPLIFICATION;AUSTRALIA;WEATHER;IMPACT,a.diluca@unsw.edu.au,,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ELSEVIER,2212-0947,,,,English,WEATHER CLIM EXTREME,Article,WoS,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000535923400008,2-s2.0-85081888974,Australia;Argentina;Spain,unsw.edu.au,Univ New South Wales;Serv Meteorol Nacl;Univ Balearic Isl,"Univ New South Wales, Australia;Serv Meteorol Nacl, Argentina;Univ Balearic Isl, Spain","Di Luca, Alejandro; de Elia, Ramon; Bador, Margot; Argueso, Daniel",,
"publicly available material obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian Ministry of Health's data processing system",Yes,"Background: Brazil is an upper middle-income country in South America with the world's sixth largest population. Despite great advances in health-care services and cardiac surgical care in both its public and private health systems, little is known on the volume, outcomes, and trends of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in Brazil's public health system. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of CABG on the public health system from January 2008 to December 2017 through the database DATASUS. Methods: This study is based on publicly available material obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian Ministry of Health's data processing system, on numbers of surgical procedures, death rates, length of stay, and costs. Only isolated CABG procedures were included in our study. We used the TabNet software from the DATASUS website to generate reports. The chi(2) test was used to compare death rates. A p < .05 was considered statistically significant. Results: We identified 226,697 CABG procedures performed from January 2008 to December 2017. The overall in-hospital mortality over the 10-year period was 5.7%. We observed statistically significant differences in death rates between the five Brazilian macro-regions. Death rates by state ranged from 2.6% to 13.1%. The national average mortality rate remained stable over the course of time. Conclusion: Over 10 years, a high volume of CABG was performed in the Brazilian Public Health System, with significant differences in mortality, number of procedures, and distribution of surgeries by region.

costs were obtained in official government databases,Yes,"Objectives: Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the gold standard for the surgical treatment of localized prostate cancer, presenting better results than radiotherapy especially for high-risk patients. Although it has clinical and technical benefits compared with open and laparoscopic techniques, the robotic-assisted RP is not publicly funded in Brazil. The objective of this study was to calculate the cost-effectiveness of the robotic-assisted RP from the Brazilian public system perspective. Methods: A state transition model was built to simulate the life of a patient undergoing RP. A total of 3 arms were compared: robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open surgeries. The assumed time horizon was 20 years; discounts were applied to both costs and health outcomes. Events and transition probabilities were obtained in the literature, and costs were obtained in official government databases. The results were reported as incremental cost-utility ratios. Results: Robotic-assisted surgery was found to be costlier but more effective than both open and laparoscopic techniques, resulting in Brazilian reals 4518 per quality-adjusted life-year and Brazilian reals 3631 per quality-adjusted life-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, respectively. Conclusions: This study gives relevant inputs for decision making regarding the inclusion of robotic-assisted RP in the Brazilian public formularies. The study demonstrates that the technology is cost-effective even when considering willingness-to-pay thresholds lower than the traditionally used ones. © 2021 ISPOR—The professional society for health economics and outcomes research",Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer From the Brazilian Public System Perspective,"Faria E.F., Rosim R.P., de Matos Nogueira E., Tobias-Machado M.",2022,Value in Health Regional Issues,29,,,60,65,,1,10.1016/j.vhri.2021.06.009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119376916&doi=10.1016%2fj.vhri.2021.06.009&partnerID=40&md5=e44275be514b3195be18510ed843a72a,"Department of Urology, Hospital Felicio Rocho, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; ValueConnected, São Paulo, Brazil; ICAVC – Cancer Institute Dr. Arnaldo, São Paulo, Brazil; Department of Urology, ABC Medical School, São Paulo, Brazil","Faria, E.F., Department of Urology, Hospital Felicio Rocho, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Rosim, R.P., ValueConnected, São Paulo, Brazil; de Matos Nogueira, E., ValueConnected, São Paulo, Brazil; Tobias-Machado, M., ICAVC – Cancer Institute Dr. Arnaldo, São Paulo, Brazil, Department of Urology, ABC Medical School, São Paulo, Brazil",cost-effectiveness analysis; Da Vinci Surgical System; prostate cancer; radical prostatectomy; robotic-assisted surgery,aged; Article; Brazil; cancer surgery; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; human; intermethod comparison; laparoscopic surgery; life; male; open surgery; prostate cancer; quality adjusted life year; robot-assisted prostatectomy; very elderly; adverse event; cost benefit analysis; procedures; prostate tumor; prostatectomy; robot assisted surgery; Brazil; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Male; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Robotic Surgical Procedures,cost-effectiveness analysis;Da Vinci Surgical System;prostate cancer;radical prostatectomy;robotic-assisted surgery;aged;Article;Brazil;cancer surgery;clinical effectiveness;clinical outcome;cohort analysis;cost effectiveness analysis;cost utility analysis;human;intermethod comparison;laparoscopic surgery;life;male;open surgery;quality adjusted life year;robot-assisted prostatectomy;very elderly;adverse event;cost benefit analysis;procedures;prostate tumor;prostatectomy;robot assisted surgery;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Humans;Prostatic Neoplasms;Robotic Surgical Procedures,"de Matos Nogueira, E.; ValueConnected, Brazil; email: enogueira@valueconnected.com",,,,,,Elsevier Inc.,22121099,,,34801887,English,Value Health Reg.

"I don't know if this is open:  ""A retrospective cohort study was performed using administrative databases""",No,"Introduction: The Brazilian Public Health System offers free-of-charge drug treatment for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) to all Brazilian citizens. We report here the first population-based cohort study on patients with AS in Brazil. The aim of this study was to evaluate the costs of the tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) blockers and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that were used in the treatments of patients with AS in Brazil between March 2010 and September 2013. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed using administrative databases. All patients with a diagnosis of AS who were aged 18 years or older and had been dispensed anti-TNF or DMARDs were included in the analysis. The cost analysis was carried out from the health system perspective, and the results were described as median monthly cost per capita and the annual cost over the study period. Results: A search of the databases identified 1251 patients with AS who were treated during the study period, of whom 63.3% were male; the median age was 41 years. During the study period, 78.0% of patients initiated treatment with anti-TNF drugs and 22.0% with DMARDs. The median monthly cost per capita was US$ 1650 for anti-TNF therapy and US$ 25 for treatment with DMARDs. Among the anti-TNF drugs, therapy with etanercept was associated with the lowest cost per patient, followed by adalimumab and infliximab. No difference in monthly cost was observed in relation to gender and age. Conclusion: The cost per patient of treating AS in this study cohort was lower with etanercept than with adalimumab and infliximab.

topics on tweets and identify their diffusion between different datasets,Yes,"Fact-checking verifies a multitude of claims and remains a promising solution to fight fake news. The spread of rumors, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories online is evident in times of crisis, when fake news ramped up across platforms, increasing fear and confusion among the population as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. This article explores fact-checking initiatives in Latin America, using an original Markov-based computational method to cluster topics on tweets and identify their diffusion between different datasets. Drawing on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods, including time-series analysis, network analysis and in-depth close reading, our article proposes an in-depth tracing of COVID-related false information across the region, comparing if there is a pattern of behavior through the countries. We rely on the open Twitter application programming interface connection to gather data from public accounts of the six major fact-checking agencies in Latin America, namely Argentina (Chequeado), Brazil (Agência Lupa), Chile (Mala Espina Check), Colombia (Colombia Check from Consejo de Redacciín), Mexico (El Sabueso from Animal Polótico) and Venezuela (Efecto Cocuyo). In total, these profiles account for 102,379 tweets that were collected between January and July 2020. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of online information dissemination beyond the national level and demonstrates how politics intertwine with the health crisis in this period. Our method is capable of clustering topics in a period of overabundance of information, as we fight not only a pandemic but also an infodemic, evidentiating opportunities to understand and slow the spread of false information. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",COVID-19 fake news diffusion across Latin America,"Ceron W., Gruszynski Sanseverino G., de-Lima-Santos M.F., Quiles M.G.",2021,Social Network Analysis and Mining,11,1,47,,,,21,10.1007/s13278-021-00753-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106274858&doi=10.1007%2fs13278-021-00753-z&partnerID=40&md5=52d409e380d16dbe8b35a98ee4ff9204,"Federal University of Sao Paulo, Av.

Globally, over 314.019.135 confirmed cases and 5.507.370 deaths have been recorded at 12 January 2022, based on the Dashboard updated by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The continuous rise in the number of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic patients has developed efficient and accessible models for prediction using Open Source Libraries and Cloud Services. This paper proposes different machine-learning algorithms to analyse the COVID-19 OpenData Resources from Mexico and Brazil, which represent the two major populations, economics and affected by disease countries in Latin America. This model uses only the COVID-19 patient's geographical, social conditions, economics conditions, clinical risk factors, symptom reports, and demographic data to predict recovery and death. The model of Mexico has an accuracy of 93% and the perceived mean of recall and the precision (F1 Score) of 0.79 on the dataset used. On the other hand, the model of Brazil has an accuracy of 69% and F1 score of 0.75 on the dataset studied. The result considers data from patients under the age of 0 and 120 years.

open data sets that are publicly available on the websites of the health ministries of the respective countries,Yes,"Objective. The aim of this study is to describe the mortality among older adults in the first wave of COVID-19 in Colombia and Mexico. Methods. This is an observational, prospective study on data obtained from open data sets that are publicly available on the websites of the health ministries of the respective countries. COVID-19 cases, age, sex, date to mortality, and mortality itself were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regressions. Results. Data on 1 779 877 individuals were analyzed, 58.2% from Mexico, with a higher frequency of men for both countries, and 11.7% were older adults. Survival curves show a continuous increase in mortality for Mexico, with higher rates for older adults, while for Colombia the mortality was observed up to 50 days of the follow-up. Finally, hazard ratios were higher for older adults in both countries. Colombia implemented a rigid curfew for older adults, and the effect on mortality is clear from the survival curves.

Study based on an administrative database (DATASUS) records,Yes,"Background This is an exploratory analysis of potential variables associated with open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery hospitalization resource use pattern. Methods Cross-sectional study based on an administrative database (DATASUS) records. Inclusion criteria were adult patients undergoing RYGB between Jan/2008 and Jun/2011. Dependent variables were length of stay (LoS) and ICU need. Independent variables were: gender, age, region, hospital volume, surgery at certified center of excellence (CoE) by the Surgical Review Corporation (SRC), teaching hospital, and year of hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate analysis (logistic regression for ICU need and linear regression for length of stay) were performed. Results Data from 13,069 surgeries were analyzed. In crude analysis, hospital volume was the most impactful variable associated with log-transformed LoS (1.312 +/- 0.302 high volume vs. 1.670 +/- 0.581 low volume, p < 0.001), whereas for ICU need it was certified CoE (odds ratio (OR), 0.016; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.010-0.026). After adjustment by logistic regression, certified CoE remained as the strongest predictor of ICU need (OR, 0.011; 95 % CI, 0.007-0.018), followed by hospital volume (OR, 3.096; 95 % CI, 2.861-3.350). Age group, male gender, and teaching hospital were also significantly associated (p < 0.001). For log-transformed LoS, final model includes hospital volume (coefficient, -0.223; 95 % CI, -0.250 to -0.196) and teaching hospital (coefficient, 0.375; 95 % CI, 0.351-0.398). Region of Brazil was not associated with any of the outcomes. Conclusions High-volume hospital was the strongest predictor for shorter LoS, whereas SRC certification was the strongest predictor of lower ICU need.

"Is an oper survey, not an open dataset",No,"Objective Because of its invasive nature, debated effect on patient outcome, and the development of alternative hemodynamic monitoring technologies, the intraoperative use of the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) has significantly decreased. The authors conducted a survey of the members of the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (SCA) to assess current use of the PAC and alternative hemodynamic monitoring technologies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Design A survey study. Setting Hospitals in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South America. Participants SCA members in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South America. Interventions The survey was e-mailed by the SCA to roughly 6,000 of its members. Measurements and Main Results The survey was left open for 30 days. Respondents accessed the survey via a secured web-based database. A total of 854 questionnaires were completed. A total of 705 (82.6%) were from North American members. Four hundred twelve of the respondents (48.1%) worked in a private practice setting, while 350 (40.9%) were from an academic practice. A majority of the respondents (57.9%) were from hospitals that performed more than 400 cardiac surgeries a year, a subset of which (29.6%) did more than 800 cases annually. For cases using cardiopulmonary bypass, 583 (68.2%) of the respondents used a PAC more than 75% of the time, while 30 (3.5%) did not use the PAC at all. Ninety-four percent of respondents used transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as part of the intraoperative monitoring. When not using a PAC, FloTrac/Vigileo was the alternative cardiac monitoring modality in 15.2% of the responses. Similar trends in monitor preferences were seen in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and minimally invasive/robotic heart surgery. Conclusions The results of this study suggested that a majority of the respondents still prefer to use the PAC for most cardiac surgeries. Subgroup analysis of the data revealed that geographical location, type of practice, and surgeon support played a significant role in the decision to use a PAC. Although most respondents prefer to use TEE as a complimentary tool, TEE also remains the most popular supplemental/alternative hemodynamic monitoring technology. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Current use of the pulmonary artery catheter in cardiac surgery: A survey study,"Judge O., Ji F., Fleming N., Liu H.",2015,Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia,29,1,,69,75,,57,10.1053/j.jvca.2014.07.016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84921510712&doi=10.1053%2fj.jvca.2014.07.016&partnerID=40&md5=51fcb236da8f6d058b59b82b1ee0f11f,"Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, United States; Department of Anesthesiology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China","Judge, O., Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, United States; Ji, F., Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, United States, Department of Anesthesiology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China; Fleming, N., Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, United States; Liu, H., Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, United States",cardiac surgery; hemodynamic monitoring; pulmonary artery catheter,"Article; Asia; Australia; cardiac surgeon; cardiopulmonary bypass; cardiovascular monitoring device; clinical assessment; controlled study; coronary artery bypass graft; e-mail; Europe; fiberoptic oximeter catheter; health survey; heart surgery; hemodynamic monitoring; human; major clinical study; medical society; minimally invasive surgery; multicenter study; New Zealand; North America; North American; off pump coronary surgery; patient monitoring; priority journal; private practice; public hospital; pulmonary artery catheter; questionnaire; robotic heart surgery; robotic surgical procedure; society; Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologist; South America; surgical patient; transesophageal echocardiography; trend study; university hospital; web browser; devices; echography; heart surgery; information processing; procedures; pulmonary artery; pulmonary artery catheterization; surgery; utilization; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Catheterization, Swan-Ganz; Data Collection; Humans; Pulmonary Artery","cardiac surgery;hemodynamic monitoring;pulmonary artery catheter;Article;Asia;Australia;cardiac surgeon;cardiopulmonary bypass;cardiovascular monitoring device;clinical assessment;controlled study;coronary artery bypass graft;e-mail;Europe;fiberoptic oximeter catheter;health survey;heart surgery;human;major clinical study;medical society;minimally invasive surgery;multicenter study;New Zealand;North America;North American;off pump coronary surgery;patient monitoring;priority journal;private practice;public hospital;questionnaire;robotic heart surgery;robotic surgical procedure;society;Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologist;South America;surgical patient;transesophageal echocardiography;trend study;university hospital;web browser;devices;echography;information processing;procedures;pulmonary artery;pulmonary artery catheterization;surgery;utilization;Cardiac Surgical Procedures;Catheterization, Swan-Ganz;Data Collection;Humans","Liu, H.; Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, United States; email: hualiu@ucdavis.edu",,,,,,W.B.

Review,No,"Introduction The incidence of cutaneous melanoma has increased worldwide over the years, and an incidence of 3 cases per 100,000 men and women is estimated in Chile. Though most of the patients are diagnosed at an early stage of the disease and have a good prognosis, advanced melanoma has poor survival results. For the treatment of melanoma, the combination of dabrafenib plus tra-metinib has been demonstrated to improve the outcome versus dabrafenib alone, but only indi-rect evidence is available for its efficacy and safety compared with immunotherapy, like nivolumab. The aim of this study is to review the available evidence to report results of efficacy and safety of dabrafenib plus trametinib in comparison with nivolumab in metastatic melanoma.Methods We searched in Epistemonikos, the largest database of systematic reviews in health, which is maintained by screening multiple information sources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, among others. We extracted data from the systematic reviews selected, reanalyzed data of primary studies, and generated a summary of the findings table using the GRADE approach.Results and conclusions We identified five systematic reviews, including seven studies overall that included one interven-tion of our interest, of which all were randomized trials. We only found indirect evidence com-paring dabrafenib plus trametinib versus nivolumab that came from Network Meta-Analyses. We concluded that it is not possible to decide if dabrafenib plus trametinib is a better strategy for advanced melanoma treatment than nivolumab because the certainty of the evidence is very low for efficacy and safety outcomes.",Dabrafenib plus trametinib versus nivolumab for advanced melanoma,"Lahoz, D., Reyes, F., Quirland, C.",2023,MEDWAVE,23,1,e2666,,,9,0,10.5867/medwave.2023.01.2666,,"[Lahoz, Daniela; Quirland, Camila] Fdn Arturo Lopez Perez, Dept Invest Canc, Unidad Evaluac Tecnol Sanit, Inst Oncol, Santiago, Chile; [Reyes, Felipe] Fdn Arturo Lopez Perez, Dept Oncol Med, Inst Oncol, Santiago, Chile",,Dabrafenib; trametinib; nivolumab; advanced melanoma; Epistemonikos; GRADE,QUALITY-OF-LIFE; METASTATIC MELANOMA; OPEN-LABEL; PHASE-III; NETWORK METAANALYSIS; MEK INHIBITION; CHECKMATE 037; COMBINED BRAF; SURVIVAL OS; MONOTHERAPY,Dabrafenib;trametinib;nivolumab;advanced melanoma;Epistemonikos;GRADE;QUALITY-OF-LIFE;METASTATIC MELANOMA;OPEN-LABEL;PHASE-III;NETWORK METAANALYSIS;MEK INHIBITION;CHECKMATE 037;COMBINED BRAF;SURVIVAL OS;MONOTHERAPY,daniela.lahoz@falp.org,,"VILLASECA 21 OFIC 702, SANTIAGO DE CHILE, 00000, CHILE",,,,MEDWAVE ESTUDIOS LTD,0717-6384,,,,English,MEDWAVE,Article,WoS,General & Internal Medicine,WOS:000954895600003,,Chile,falp.org,Fdn Arturo Lopez Perez,"Fdn Arturo Lopez Perez, Chile","Lahoz, Daniela; Reyes, Felipe; Quirland, Camila",,
They generated an oper dataset!! :),Yes,"Understanding the fine scale spatial distribution of births and pregnancies is crucial for informing planning decisions related to public health. This is especially important in lower income countries where infectious disease is a major concern for pregnant women and new-borns, as highlighted by the recent Zika virus epidemic. Despite this, the spatial detail of basic data on the numbers and distribution of births and pregnancies is often of a coarse resolution and difficult to obtain, with no co-ordination between countries and organisations to create one consistent set of subnational estimates.

The data mining software was WEKA (open source). The data mining conducts a database search and provides rules to be analyzed to transform the data into useful information. After mining, 4,230 rules were selected: teenage pregnancy plus birth weight < 2,500g, or post-term birth plus teenage mother with a previous child or intercurrent conditions increase the risk of neonatal death. The results highlight the need for greater attention to teenage mothers, newborns with birth weight < 2,500g, post-term neonates, and infants of mothers with intercurrent conditions, thus corroborating other studies.",Data mining and characteristics of infant mortality,"Vianna, R.C.X.F., Moro, C.M.C.D., Moyses, S.J., Carvalho, D., Nievola, J.C.",2010,CADERNOS DE SAUDE PUBLICA,26,3,,535,542,8,12,10.1590/S0102-311X2010000300011,,"[Xavier Ferreira Vianna, Rossana Cristina] Secretaria Estado Saude Parana, BR-80230140 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Xavier Ferreira Vianna, Rossana Cristina; Cabral de Barra Moro, Claudia Maria; Moyses, Samuel Jorge; Carvalho, Deborah; Nievola, Julio Cesar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Programa Posgrad Tecnol Saude, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Moyses, Samuel Jorge] Secretaria Municipal Saude Curitiba, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Carvalho, Deborah] Univ Tuiuti, Inst Paranaense Desenvolvimento Econ & Social, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",,Database; Infant Mortality; Information Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Epidemiologic Surveillance,BRAZIL; FETAL,Database;Infant Mortality;Information Systems;Artificial Intelligence;Epidemiologic Surveillance;BRAZIL;FETAL,rossanacxfv@yahoo.com.br,,"RUA LEOPOLDO BUHOES 1480, RIO DE JANIERO, RJ 210410210, BRAZIL",,,,CADERNOS SAUDE PUBLICA,0102-311X,,,20464072,Portuguese,CAD SAUDE PUBLICA,Article,WoS,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",WOS:000277561100011,,Brazil,yahoo.com.br,Secretaria Estado Saude Parana;Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana;Secretaria Municipal Saude Curitiba;Univ Tuiuti,"Secretaria Estado Saude Parana, Brazil;Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Brazil;Secretaria Municipal Saude Curitiba, Brazil;Univ Tuiuti, Brazil","Xavier Ferreira Vianna, Rossana Cristina; Cabral de Barra Moro, Claudia Maria; Moyses, Samuel Jorge; Carvalho, Deborah; Nievola, Julio Cesar",,

Between 2012 and 2021, the number of deceased and injured motorcyclists among all road users was 50%, with an annual average of 3140 fatal victims and 20,800 injured victims. Bogota, Cali, and Medellin were the cities with the most accidents. In Bogota in 2017, the deaths of motorcyclists on the roads were around 32% of the road actors. This data article presents the dataset used to analyze and predict the severity of motorcyclist road accidents in Bogota in the article entitled ""Extraction of decision rules using genetic algorithms and simulated annealing for prediction of severity of traffic accidents by motorcyclists"" [1] . The data set was consolidated from the registration of 175,245 traffic accidents and the report of 337,828 road actors involved in crashes in Bogota between January 2013 and February 2018. The data was compiled, processed, and enriched with additional information about infrastructure and weather conditions. The data corresponds to 35,693 motorcyclist traffic accidents, represented by 28 variables, and classified into five categories: road actors, motorcyclists and individuals involved, weather conditions and timing, road conditions and location and characteristics of the accident. The data on motorcyclist traffic accidents opens up a scenario to deepen and compare road safety in Latin America, where studies on vulnerable road users are limited. According to severity, the data on motorcycle traffic accidents recorded 28% with material damage, 69% with injured and 3% with fatal victims. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

They are mapping and publishing the public databases of Drug Utilization in Brazil,Yes,"Background: In Brazil, studies that map electronic healthcare databases in order to assess their suitability for use in pharmacoepidemiologic research are lacking. We aimed to identify, catalogue, and characterize Brazilian data sources for Drug Utilization Research (DUR).Methods: The present study is part of the project entitled, ""Publicly Available Data Sources for Drug Utilization Research in Latin American (LatAm) Countries."" A network of Brazilian health experts was assembled to map secondary administrative data from healthcare organizations that might provide information related to medication use. A multi-phase approach including internet search of institutional government websites, traditional bibliographic databases, and experts' input was used for mapping the data sources. The reviewers searched, screened and selected the data sources independently; disagreements were resolved by consensus. Data sources were grouped into the following categories: 1) automated databases; 2) Electronic Medical Records (EMR); 3) national surveys or datasets; 4) adverse event reporting systems; and 5) others. Each data source was characterized by accessibility, geographic granularity, setting, type of data (aggregate or individual-level), and years of coverage. We also searched for publications related to each data source.Results: A total of 62 data sources were identified and screened; 38 met the eligibility criteria for inclusion and were fully characterized. We grouped 23 (60%) as automated databases, four (11%) as adverse event reporting systems, four (11%) as EMRs, three (8%) as national surveys or datasets, and four (11%) as other types. Eighteen (47%) were classified as publicly and conveniently accessible online; providing information at national level. Most of them offered more than 5 years of comprehensive data coverage, and presented data at both the individual and aggregated levels. No information about population coverage was found. Drug coding is not uniform; each data source has its own coding system, depending on the purpose of the data. At least one scientific publication was found for each publicly available data source.Conclusions: There are several types of data sources for DUR in Brazil, but a uniform system for drug classification and data quality evaluation does not exist.

They are mapping and publishing the public databases of Drug Utilization in Argentina,Yes,"In order to compile an inventory of national data sources for drug utilization research (DUR) in Argentina and to verify publicly available data sources, we performed a cross-sectional study that sought to identify national and provincial databases of drug use. In July 2020, we searched the websites of government institutions, carried out a systematic query of bibliographic databases for ""drug utilization research"" conducted in Argentina, and conducted a survey with local experts. Data collected included: the institution responsible for the database, population covered, accessibility, source of the data, healthcare setting, geographic information, and whether data were individual or aggregated. Descriptive analyses were then performed. We identified 31 data sources for DUR; only one was publicly and conveniently accessible. Five published aggregated data and provide more detailed access by formal request. Only seven sources (23%) reported national data, and most (n=29) included only data from the public healthcare sector. Although data sources for DUR have been found in Argentina, limited access by researchers and policymakers is still an significant obstacle.

I don't think is realted with heathcare,No,"Remote sensing is an invaluable tool to objectively illustrate the rapid decline in habitat extents worldwide. The many operational Earth Observation platforms provide options for the generation of land cover maps, each with unique characteristics and considerable semantic differences in the definition of classes. As a result, differences in baseline estimates are inevitable. Here we compare forest cover and surface water estimates over four time periods spanning three decades (1989-2018) for similar to 1.3 million km(2) encompassing the Xingu River Basin, Brazil, from published, freely accessible remotely sensed land cover classifications. While all showed a decrease in forest extent over time, the total deforested area reported by each ranged widely for all time periods. The greatest differences ranged from 9% to 17% (116,958 to 219,778 km(2)) deforestation of the total area for year 2000 and 2014-2018 time period, respectively. We also show the high sensitivity of forest fragmentation metrics (entropy and foreground area density) to data quality and spatial resolution, with cloud cover and sensor artefacts resulting in errors. Surface water classifications must be chosen carefully because sources differ greatly in location and mapped area of surface water. After operationalization of the Belo Monte dam complex, the large reservoirs are notably absent from several of the classifications illustrating land cover. Freshwater ecosystem health is influenced by the land cover surrounding water bodies (e.g., riparian zones). Understanding differences between the many remotely sensed baselines is fundamentally important to avoid information misuse, and to objectively choose the most appropriate classification for ecological studies, conservation, or policy making. The differences between the classifications examined here are not a failure of the technology, but due to different interpretations of 'forest cover' and characteristics of the input data (e.g., spatial resolution). Our findings demonstrate the importance of transparency in the generation of remotely sensed classifications and the need for users to familiarize themselves with the characteristics and limitations of each data set.",Deciphering the many maps of the Xingu River Basin - an assessment of land cover classifications at multiple scales,"Kalacska, M., Arroyo-Mora, J.P., Lucanus, O., Sousa, L., Pereira, T., Vieira, T.",2020,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA,166,1,,,,55,2,,,"[Kalacska, Margaret; Lucanus, Oliver] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Appl Remote Sensing Lab, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Arroyo-Mora, J.

At later stages, it is impossible to cure. However, if the early symptoms of cancer are identified using diagnostic methods, there is a possibility of treatment and gradual cure. In order to aid in the diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas, the application of Artificial Intelligence was viewed as a solution. Initially, various machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Twin Support Vector Machines and RadSTM-ER were used, yielding encouraging results. However, the arduous process of feature extraction and manual feature selection resulted in researchers turning towards deep learning methods. This research work uses ultrasound images of the pancreas obtained from an open sourced database by the gastroenterology unit of National University of Colombia. The implementation was carried out using transfer learning on Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Networks (DenseNets). DenseNet201 using pretrained weights of ImageNet was fine-tuned on 26469 pancreatic ultrasound images consisting of three categories: cancer, healthy and pancreatitis. Additionally, cross validation on 2940 images yielded an accuracy of 99.87 %. Apart from this, 9804 images of the same distribution were used to test the performance. The DenseNet201 model was able to yield an accuracy of 99.877 %, a sensitivity of 0.9987, a specificity of 0.99931 and a positive prediction value of 0.99877, with only 12 out of 9804 misclassified examples. The ability of deep transfer learning on DenseNet201 to generalize exceedingly well encourages its beta testing on real time data and subsequent deployment. © 2021 IEEE.",Deep Transfer Learning for Pancreatic Cancer Detection,"Baldota S., Sharma S., Malathy C.",2021,"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies, ICCCNT 2021",,,,,,,1,10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9580000,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126196577&doi=10.1109%2fICCCNT51525.2021.9580000&partnerID=40&md5=d5cb97056537b3ac9397647544e5110a,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur603203, India","Baldota, S., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur603203, India; Sharma, S., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur603203, India; Malathy, C., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur603203, India",Deep Learning; DenseNets; Fine tuning; Pancreatic Cancer; Transfer Learning,Convolutional neural networks; Curing; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Support vector machines; Ultrasonic applications; Cancer detection; Causes of death; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Densely connected convolutional neural network; Fine tuning; Late stage; Pancreatic cancers; Transfer learning; Ultrasound images; Diseases,Deep Learning;DenseNets;Fine tuning;Pancreatic Cancer;Transfer Learning;Convolutional neural networks;Curing;Feature extraction;Learning algorithms;Support vector machines;Ultrasonic applications;Cancer detection;Causes of death;Convolutional neural network;Densely connected convolutional neural network;Late stage;Pancreatic cancers;Ultrasound images;Diseases,,,,"12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies, ICCCNT 2021",,6 July 2021 through 8 July 2021,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781728185958,,,English,"Int.

"Is about a MOOC, not data",No,"Introduction: Planetary health (PH) has emerged as a leading field for raising awareness, debating, and finding solutions for the health impacts of human-caused disruptions to Earth's natural systems. PH education addresses essential questions of how humanity inhabits Earth, and how humans affect, and are affected by, natural systems. A pilot massive open online course (MOOC) in PH was created in Brazil in 2020. This MOOC capitalized on the global online pivot, to make the course accessible to a broader audience. This study describes the process of course creation and development and assesses the impact evaluation data and student outcomes of the PH MOOC.Methods: The PH MOOC pilot was launched in Brazilian Portuguese, using the TelessaudeRS-UFRGS platform on 4/27/2020 and concluded on 7/19/2020 with a total load of 80 h. It was composed of 8 content modules, pre and post-test, 10 topics in a forum discussion, and an optional action plan. This study analyzes the course database, profile of participants, answers to questionnaires, forum interaction, and action plans submitted.Results: Two thousand seven hundred seventy-seven participants enrolled in the course, of which 1,237 (44.54%) gave informed consent for this study. Of the 1,237 participants who agreed to participate in the research, 614 (49.8%) completed the course, and 569 (92.67%) were accredited by TelessaudeRS-UFRGS. The majority of the participants were concerned with climate change, trained in the health area, and worked in primary health care in places that lacked ongoing sustainability programs. Two hundred forty-one action plans were submitted, major topics identified were food and nutrition, infectious diseases, and garbage and recycling.Discussion: The use of the PH lens and open perspective of the course centered the need to communicate planetary health topics to individuals. The local plans reflected the motto of ""think global and act local."" Brazil presents a context of an unprecedented social, political, and environmental crisis, with massive deforestation, extensive fires, and biomass burning altering the biomes, on top of an ongoing necropolitical infodemic and COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of these multiple challenges, this MOOC offers a timely resource for health professionals and communities, encouraging them to address planetary challenges as fundamental health determinants.",Development and Assessment of a Brazilian Pilot Massive Open Online Course in Planetary Health Education: An Innovative Model for Primary Care Professionals and Community Training,"Floss, M., Ilgenfritz, C.A.V., Rodrigues, Y.E., Dilda, A.C., Correa, A.P.B., de Melo, D.A.C., Barros, E.F., Guzman, C.A.F., Devlin, E., Saldiva, P.H.N., Khoo, S.M., Goncalves, M.R.",2021,FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,9,,663783,,,14,6,10.3389/fpubh.2021.663783,,"[Floss, Mayara] Univ Sao Paulo, Programa Posgrad Patol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Vieira Ilgenfritz, Carlos Augusto; Claudia Dilda, Anna; Azevedo Conte de Melo, Diego] Grp Hosp Conceicao, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Ylana Elias; Borngraeber Correa, Ana Paula; Goncalves, Marcelo Rodrigues] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, TelessaudeRS UFRGS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Falceto Barros, Enrique] World Org Family Doctors WONCA Working Party Envi, Santa Maria Herval, RS, Brazil; [Faerron Guzman, Carlos Alberto] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Planetary Hlth Alliance, Boston, MA USA; [Devlin, Erin] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Saldiva, Paulo Hilario Nascimento] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Adv Studies, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Khoo, Su-Ming] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Polit Sci & Sociol, Galway, Ireland; [Khoo, Su-Ming] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Ryan Inst, Galway, Ireland",,Latin America; climate change; primary healthcare (PHC); community training; massive open online course (MOOC); planetary health,,Latin America;climate change;primary healthcare (PHC);community training;massive open online course (MOOC);planetary health,mfloss@usp.br,,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,,,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,,,,34976906,English,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Article,WoS,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",WOS:000738282000001,2-s2.0-85121972596,Brazil;United States;Ireland,usp.br,Univ Sao Paulo;Grp Hosp Conceicao;Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul;World Org Family Doctors WONCA Working Party Envi;Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth;Oregon State Univ;Natl Univ Ireland Galway,"Univ Sao Paulo, Brazil;Grp Hosp Conceicao, Brazil;Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil;World Org Family Doctors WONCA Working Party Envi, Brazil;Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, United States;Oregon State Univ, United States;Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Ireland","Floss, Mayara; Vieira Ilgenfritz, Carlos Augusto; Rodrigues, Ylana Elias; Claudia Dilda, Anna; Borngraeber Correa, Ana Paula; Azevedo Conte de Melo, Diego; Falceto Barros, Enrique; Faerron Guzman, Carlos Alberto; Devlin, Erin; Saldiva, Paulo Hilario Nascimento; Khoo, Su-Ming; Goncalves, Marcelo Rodrigues",,
I think is not open data,No,"Background: Despite its relatively low incidence of associated diseases, Human T-cell Leukemia Virus-1 (HTLV-1) infection was reported to carry a significant risk of mortality in several endemic areas. HTLV-1-associated diseases, adult T-cell leukemia /lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraperesis (HAM/TSP), as well as frequent coinfections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Strongyloides stercoralis were associated to increased morbidity and mortality of HTLV-1 infection. Objective: To determine the mortality rate and its associated variables from an open cohort started in July 1997 at the HTLV Clinic, Emilio Ribas Institute (IIER), a major infectious disease hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Since inception up to September 2018, we admitted 727 HTLV-1-infected individuals, with a rate of 30-50 new admissions per year. All patient data, including clinical and laboratory data, were regularly updated throughout the 21-year period, using a dedicated REDCap database. The Ethical Board of IIER approved the protocol. Results: During 21 years of clinical care to people living with HTLV-1 in the Sao Paulo region, we recruited 479 asymptomatic HTLV-1-infected individuals and 248 HAM/TSP patients, of which 632 remained under active follow-up. During a total of 3800 person-years of follow-up (maximum follow-up 21.5 years, mean follow-up 6.0 years), 27 individuals died (median age of 51.5 years), of which 12 were asymptomatic, one ATLL patient and 14 HAM/TSP patients. HAM/TSP diagnosis (but neither age nor gender) was a significant predictor of increased mortality by univariate and multivariate (hazard ratio (HR) 5.03, 95% CI [1.96-12.91], p = 0.001) Cox regression models. Coinfection with HIV/HCV was an independent predictor of increased mortality (HR 15.08; 95% CI [5.50-41.32]; p < 0.001), with AIDS-related infections as a more frequent cause of death in asymptomatics (6/13; p = 0.033). HIV/HCV-negative fatal HAM/TSP cases were all female, with urinary tract infection and decubitus ulcer-associated sepsis as the main cause of death (8/14, p = 0.002). Conclusions: All-cause mortality among people living with HTLV-1 in Sao Paulo differs between asymptomatic (2.9%) and HAM/TSP patients (7.3%), independent of age and gender. We observe a dichotomy in fatal cases, with HAM/TSP and HIV/HCV coinfection as independent risk factors for death. Our findings reveal an urgent need for public health actions, as the major causes of death, infections secondary to decubitus ulcers, and immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related infections, can be targeted by preventive measures.","Dichotomy in Fatal Outcomes in a Large Cohort of People Living with HTLV-1 in Sao Paulo, Brazil","Marcusso, R.M.N., Van Weyenbergh, J., de Moura, J.V.L., Dahy, F.E., Matos, A.D.B., Haziot, M.E.J., Vidal, J.E., Fonseca, L.A.M., Smid, J., Assone, T., Casseb, J., de Oliveira, A.C.P.",2020,PATHOGENS,9,1,25,,,10,8,10.3390/pathogens9010025,,"[Marcusso, Rosa Maria N.; Luisi de Moura, Joao Victor; Dahy, Flavia Esper; Haziot, Michel E.

Review,No,"Background: Biomedical research and publications provide evidence-based information about the extent and burden of health-related problems of a country and help to formulate strategic and operational plans to tackle the problems. Purpose: To determine the biomedical publication rates of CARICOM full member countries. Methods: Biomedical publications of full member CARICOM countries were retrieved using PubMed (1990-2015) and SCImago Journal & Country Rank (1996-2015) databases. CARICOM countries having >50 publications in the PubMed (1990-2015) database were subject to further analysis, whereby publications of each country were adjusted by total population (million population), gross domestic product (billion-dollar), and Internet usage rate (hundred thousand population). Results: Total publications by all countries were 7281 and 8378 in PubMed and SCImago Journal & Country Rank, respectively. Jamaica produced highest number of publications (PubMed: 3928 (53.9%); SCImago Journal & Country Rank: 2850 (34.0%)). In both databases, Grenada had the highest research publications when adjusted with per million population (4721 and 10,633), per billion gross domestic product (803 and 1651), and per hundred thousand Internet users (1487 and 3387). Trend analysis revealed Jamaica produced the highest number of additional PubMed listed publications each year, averaging 4.8/year, followed by Trinidad and Tobago (4.4). According to SCImago Journal & Country Rank, Jamaica also had the highest number of citations (42,311) and h-index (76), followed by Trinidad and Tobago (29,152 and 71). Barbados had the highest number of citations per document (24.9), followed by Haiti (18.4). The publication rates determined by PubMed and SCImago Journal & Country Rank databases were significantly correlated (p < 0.001). Most publications (68% SCImago Journal & Country Rank and 85% PubMed) can be attributed to authors affiliated with Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad. Conclusion: Publication and citation rates varied markedly between CARICOM countries and were in general low. Most publications could be attributed to researchers affiliated with The University of the West Indies.

Multiple publicly available data sources,Yes,"Background: This study analyzed several political determinants of increased private-sector management in Brazilian health care. In Brazil, the poor depend almost exclusively on the public Unified Health System (the SUS), which remains severely underfunded. Given the overhead costs associated with privately contracted health services, increased private management is one driver of higher expenditures in the system. Although left parties campaign most vocally in support of greater public control of the SUS, the extent to which their stated positions translate into health care policy remains untested. Methods: Drawing on multiple publicly available data sources, we used linear regression to analyze how political party-in-power and existing private sector health care contracting affect the share of privately managed health care services and outsourcing in municipalities. Data from two election periods - 2004 to 2008 and 2008 to 2012 - were analyzed. Results: Our findings showed that although private sector contracting varies greatly across municipalities, this variation is not systematically associated with political party in power. This suggests that electoral politics plays a relatively minor role in municipal-level health care administration. Existing levels of private sector management appear to have a greater effect on the public-private makeup of the Brazilian healthcare system, suggesting a strong role of path dependence in the evolution of Brazilian health care delivery. Conclusion: Despite campaign rhetoric asserting distinct positions on privatization in the SUS, factors other than political party in power have a greater effect on private-sector health system management at the municipal-level in Brazil. Given the limited effect of elections on this issue, strengthening participatory bodies such as municipal health councils may better enfranchise citizens in the fundamental debate over public and private roles in the health care sector. © 2017 The Author(s).",Do elections matter for private-sector healthcare management in Brazil?

"The data were obtained from DATASUS, a Brazilian government's open-access public health database",Yes,"Introduction: The Brazilian childhood National Immunization Program (NIP) introduced live and attenuated varicella vaccination in a single dose, combined as tetraviral vaccine, at 15 months of age in the whole country, during September to December of 2013. The aim of this study was to report trends in incidence of childhood hospital admissions related to varicella and zoster in Brazil from 2003 to 2016, including the first three years after vaccine introduction. Methods: The number and incidence of hospital admission in patients aged less than 20 years in Brazilian public health system with an admission diagnosis of varicella and zoster from 2003 to 2016 were analyzed and pre (2003-2013) and post-vaccination periods (2014-2016) were compared. The data were obtained from DATASUS, a Brazilian government's open-access public health database system, and analyzed adjusting for secular trend and seasonality if a statistically significant change was found. Results: During the study period, 69,791 admissions due to varicella and herpes zoster occurred in the children younger than 20 years. After adjusting for seasonality, the incidence of hospitalizations decreased from 27.33 to 14.33 per 100000 per year, which corresponds to a reduction of 47.6% (95% confidence interval 18.19-77.04%, p < 0.001) in the vaccinated age group (1-4 years) in 2014-2016 compared to pre-vaccination period. The changes were not significant in the unvaccinated age groups. Conclusion: The hospitalizations due to varicella and herpes zoster were decreased by half early after the introduction of a single dose of tetraviral vaccine in NIP in the vaccinated children. Further studies may assess duration and intensity of this effect, as well as the indirect effect in the unvaccinated age groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This is not in humans,No,"Alphavirus infection associated encephalitis is an emerging infectious disease with a high impact on public health in Latin America. Objective: To study the eco-epidemiology of alphaviruses in bats of departments of Cordoba and Sucre, Colombia. Methodology: A prospective descriptive cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sampling, in 12 localities of Cordoba and Sucre was carried out. Using mist nets capture of the specimens was carried out. The size of the sample was 286 bats, each specimen captured was taxonomically classified. The bats were immobilized with anesthetic and analgesic treatment according to the ethics committee of the University of Cordoba, morphometric measurements and blood samples were taken, later they were necropsied in the field to obtain a collection of tissues which were preserved in liquid N-2 - 190 degrees C. The averages of the climatic conditions of the sampling sites were extracted from the WorldClim database (http://www.worldclim.org/). The open source software QGIS (Quantum GIS Development Team.2015) was used to map and visualize bioclimatic regions of Cordoba. We used descriptive and retrospective information about the equine population and reports of foci of equine encephalitis. Results: In Cordoba and Sucre, 286 bats were captured and 23 species were classified, Artibeus and Phyllostomus discolor were the most frequent captured genus. The geographic ranges of the captured species were variable, some had a wide distribution and others were restricted to some areas. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus RNA was detected in Artibeus planirostris and Sturnira lilium (2/286 = 0.70%) from Cordoba Colombia. The univariate descriptive analysis showed no significant association for any of the analyzed variables climatic.

Results The mean total GHSI score of the 159 countries in 2021 was (41. 19±13. 41), with a minimum of 16. 10 (Yemen) and a maximum of 75.90 (The United States). As of 31 December 2021, the crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 in 159 countries was 0. 02 (0. 01, 0. 03), with a minimum <0. 01 (Bhutan) and a maximum of 0. 20 (Yemen). The total number of confirmed cases per million population was 50 844.42 (5 807. 88, 101 572.70), with a minimum of 22.26 (Republic of Vanuatu) and a maximum of 251 608. 38 (Slovakia). The total number of deaths per million population was 590. 71 (105. 66,1533. 20), with a minimum of 3. 10 (Burundi) and a maximum of 6 075. 95 (Peru). Multiple linear regression analysis results showed that the Detect score of GHS1 was negatively correlated with the total confirmed cases per million population (fi =-0. 34, P =0. 038) and the total deaths per million population (fi = -0.42, P = 0. 025); the Norms score of GHS1 was negatively correlated with the total confirmed cases per million population (fi = -0. 49, P = 0. 041), and the Health score of GHS1 was positively correlated with the total deaths per million population (fi =0.65, P = 0.003). Risk score of GHS1 was inversely correlated with case fatality rate(fi = -0. 91, P = 0. 044). Conclusion The GHS 1ndex has limited value in assessing a country’s capacity to respond to the COV1D-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, it has potential value in others. © 2022, Publication Centre of Anhui Medical University.

Review,No,"Since 1999, Brazil has undertaken annual influenza vaccine campaigns, free of charge, targeting the elderly population, health professionals, and immune-deficient patients. We conducted a systematic review of literature in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative. We used the keywords influenza, vaccine, Brazil and effectiveness to search the main databases. Thirty-one studies matched our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Influenza vaccine coverage among the elderly is high, though not as high as suggested by the official figures. Estimates on effectiveness are scarce. The majority come from ecological studies that show a modest reduction in mortality and hospital admissions due to influenza-related causes. Such reduction is not evident in the North and Northeastern states of Brazil, a finding that is probably related to the different seasonal pattern of influenza in equatorial and tropical regions. Brazilian epidemiologists still owe society better-designed studies addressing the effectiveness of influenza vaccine campaigns.","Effectiveness of the brazilian influenza vaccination policy, a systematic review [Efetividade da polĩtica brasileira de vacinação contra influenza, uma revisão sistemática]","Luna E.J.A., Gattas V.L.",2010,Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo,52,4,,175,181,,14,10.1590/S0036-46652010000400002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77957978258&doi=10.1590%2fS0036-46652010000400002&partnerID=40&md5=44b99c25a1387ca9cfc691ecc2fd3843,"Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil; Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, SP, Brazil","Luna, E.J.A., Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil; Gattás, V.L., Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, SP, Brazil",Brazil; Effectiveness; Influenza; Vaccines,"influenza vaccine; article; Brazil; clinical effectiveness; disease surveillance; drug efficacy; elderly care; health care policy; health program; hospital admission; human; influenza; influenza vaccination; mass immunization; mortality; outcome assessment; risk reduction; seasonal variation; systematic review; treatment planning; Aged; Brazil; Health Policy; Humans; Immunization Programs; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","Brazil;Effectiveness;Influenza;Vaccines;influenza vaccine;article;clinical effectiveness;disease surveillance;drug efficacy;elderly care;health care policy;health program;hospital admission;human;influenza vaccination;mass immunization;mortality;outcome assessment;risk reduction;seasonal variation;systematic review;treatment planning;Aged;Health Policy;Humans;Immunization Programs;Influenza Vaccines;Influenza, Human;Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","Luna, E.

"several publicly available sources in Brazil,",Yes,"Background COVID-19 spread rapidly in Brazil despite the country's well established health and social protection systems. Understanding the relationships between health-system preparedness, responses to COVID-19, and the pattern of spread of the epidemic is particularly important in a country marked by wide inequalities in socioeconomic characteristics (eg, housing and employment status) and other health risks (age structure and burden of chronic disease). Methods From several publicly available sources in Brazil, we obtained data on health risk factors for severe COVID-19 (proportion of the population with chronic disease and proportion aged >= 60 years), socioeconomic vulnerability (proportions of the population with housing vulnerability or without formal work), health-system capacity (numbers of intensive care unit beds and physicians), coverage of health and social assistance, deaths from COVID-19, and state-level responses of government in terms of physical distancing policies. We also obtained data on the proportion of the population staying at home, based on locational data, as a measure of physical distancing adherence. We developed a socioeconomic vulnerability index (SVI) based on household characteristics and the Human Development Index. Data were analysed at the state and municipal levels. Descriptive statistics and correlations between state-level indicators were used to characterise the relationship between the availability of health-care resources and socioeconomic characteristics and the spread of the epidemic and the response of governments and populations in terms of new investments, legislation, and physical distancing. We used linear regressions on a municipality-by-month dataset from February to October, 2020, to characterise the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths and response to the epidemic across municipalities. Findings The initial spread of COVID-19 was mostly affected by patterns of socioeconomic vulnerability as measured by the SVI rather than population age structure and prevalence of health risk factors. The states with a high (greater than median) SVI were able to expand hospital capacity, to enact stringent COVID-19-related legislation, and to increase physical distancing adherence in the population, although not sufficiently to prevent higher COVID-19 mortality during the initial phase of the epidemic compared with states with a low SVI. Death rates accelerated until June, 2020, particularly in municipalities with the highest socioeconomic vulnerability. Throughout the following months, however, differences in policy response converged in municipalities with lower and higher SVIs, while physical distancing remained relatively higher and death rates became relatively lower in the municipalities with the highest SVIs compared with those with lower SVIs. Interpretation In Brazil, existing socioeconomic inequalities, rather than age, health status, and other risk factors for COVID-19, have affected the course of the epidemic, with a disproportionate adverse burden on states and municipalities with high socioeconomic vulnerability. Local government responses and population behaviour in the states and municipalities with higher socioeconomic vulnerability have helped to contain the effects of the epidemic. Targeted policies and actions are needed to protect those with the greatest socioeconomic vulnerability. This experience could be relevant in other low-income and middle-income countries where socioeconomic vulnerability varies greatly.Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Daily time-series data on SARS-CoV-2 infections were sourced from the health authorities of the three countries at the smallest available administrative level,Yes,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused societal disruption globally, and South America has been hit harder than other lower-income regions. This study modeled the effects of six weather variables on district-level SARS-CoV-2 reproduction numbers (Rt) in three contiguous countries of tropical Andean South America (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru), adjusting for environmental, policy, healthcare infrastructural and other factors. Methods: Daily time-series data on SARS-CoV-2 infections were sourced from the health authorities of the three countries at the smallest available administrative level. Rt values were calculated and merged by date and unit ID with variables from a unified COVID-19 dataset and other publicly available sources for May–December, 2020. Generalized additive models were fitted. Findings: Relative humidity and solar radiation were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 Rt. Days with radiation above 1000 kJ/m2 saw a 1.3% reduction in Rt, and those with humidity above 50% recorded a 0.9% reduction in Rt. Transmission was highest in densely populated districts, and lowest in districts with poor healthcare access and on days with lowest population mobility. Wind speed, temperature, region, aggregate government policy response, and population age structure had little impact. The fully adjusted model explained 4.3% of Rt variance. Interpretation: Dry atmospheric conditions of low humidity increase district-level SARS-CoV-2 reproduction numbers, while higher levels of solar radiation decrease district-level SARS-CoV-2 reproduction numbers — effects that are comparable in magnitude to population factors like lockdown compliance. Weather monitoring could be incorporated into disease surveillance and early warning systems in conjunction with more established risk indicators and surveillance measures.

"From publicly available datasets, we extracted data on patients assigned an ECSC-related ICD-10 code and on the country's emergency facilities from 2015-2019",Yes,"Background: The benefits of treatment for many conditions are time dependent. The burden of these emergency care sensitive conditions (ECSCs) is especially high in low- and middle-income countries. Our objective was to analyze geospatial trends in ECSCs and characterize regional disparities in access to emergency care in Brazil. Methods: From publicly available datasets, we extracted data on patients assigned an ECSC-related ICD-10 code and on the country's emergency facilities from 2015-2019. Using ArcGIS, OpenStreetMap, and WorldPop, we created catchment areas corresponding to 180 minutes of driving distance from each hospital. We then used ArcGIS to characterize space-time trends in ECSC admissions and to complete an Origin-Destination analysis to determine the path from household to closest hospital. Findings: There were 1362 municipalities flagged as “hot spots,” areas with a high volume of ECSCs. Of those, 69.7% were more than 180 minutes (171 km) from the closest emergency facility. These municipalities were primarily located in the states of Minas Gerais, Bahia, Espiríto Santo, Tocantins, and Amapá. In the North region, only 69.1% of the population resided within 180 minutes of an emergency hospital. Interpretations: Significant geographical barriers to accessing emergency care exist in certain areas of Brazil, especially in peri-urban areas and the North region. One limitation of this approach is that geolocation was not possible in some areas and thus we are likely underestimating the burden of inadequate access. Subsequent work should evaluate ECSC mortality data.

Review,No,"BACKGROUND: Faced with a pandemic, all healthcare actions need to reflect best practices, in order to avoid high transmissibility, complications and even hospitalizations. For hospital environments, the products recommended and authorized by regulatory institutions for environmental cleaning and disinfection need to be highly effective. OBJECTIVE: To identify, systematically evaluate and summarize the best available scientific evidence on environmental cleaning to prevent COVID-19 infection. DESIGN AND SETTING: A systematic review of studies analyzing cleaning products that inactivate corona-virus, conducted within the evidence-based health program of a federal university in São Paulo (SP), Brazil. METHODS: A systematic search of the relevant literature was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Co-chrane Library, CINAHL and LILACS databases, for articles published up to May 27, 2020, relating to studies evaluating cleaning products that inactivate coronavirus in the environment. RESULTS: Seven studies were selected. These analyzed use of 70% alcohol, detergent, detergent containing iodine, household bleach, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, glutaraldehyde, ultraviolet irradiation and plasma air purifier. The effectiveness of treating sewage with sodium hypochlo-rite and chlorine dioxide was also evaluated. CONCLUSION: Disinfection of environments, especially those in ordinary use, such as bathrooms, needs to be done constantly. Viral inactivation was achieved using chlorine-based disinfectants, alcohol, deter-gents, glutaraldehyde, iodine-containing detergents, hydrogen peroxide compounds and household bleaches.

"Data from procedures performed between 2008 and 2019 were extracted from the national public database (Departamento de Informatica do Sistema Unico de Saude, or DATASUS) using web scraping techniques",Yes,"Introduction: Although endovascular correction is a promising perspective, the gold-standard treatment for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurisms and type-B dissections with visceral involvement remains open surgery, particularly due to its well- established long-term durability. This study aims to describe and evaluate public data from patients treated for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurism in the Brazilian public health system in a 12-year interval. Methods: Data from procedures performed between 2008 and 2019 were extracted from the national public database (Departamento de Informatica do Sistema Unico de Saude, or DATASUS) using web scraping techniques. Procedures were evaluated regarding the yearly frequency of elective or urgency surgeries, in-hospital mortality, and governmental costs. All tests were done with a level of significance P<0.05. Results:A total of 812 procedures were analyzed. Of all surgeries,67.98% were elective cases. There were 328 in-hospital deaths (mortality of 40.39%). In-hospital mortality was lower in elective procedures (26.92%) than in urgency procedures (46.74%) (P=0.008). Total governmental expenditure was $3.127.051,56 - an average of $3.774,22 for elective surgery and $3.791,93 for emergency surgery (P=0.999). Conclusion: The proportion of urgency procedures is higher than that recommended by international literature.

This study aimed to describe rates of carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed between 2008 and 2019 in the country through web scraping of publicly available databases,Yes,"Background: Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide, with carotid atherosclerosis accounting for 10–20% of cases. In Brazil, the Public Health System provides care for roughly two-thirds of the population. No studies, however, have analysed large–scale results of carotid bifurcation surgery in Brazil. Methods: This study aimed to describe rates of carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed between 2008 and 2019 in the country through web scraping of publicly available databases. Results: Between 2008 and 2019, 37,424 carotid bifurcation revascularization procedures were performed, of which 22,578 were CAS (60.34%) and 14,846 (39.66%) were CEA. There were 620 in-hospital deaths (1.66%), 336 after CAS (1.48%) and 284 after CEA (1.92%) (P = 0.032). Governmental reimbursement was US$ 77,216,298.85 (79.31% of all reimbursement) for CAS procedures and US$ 20,143,009.63 (20.69%) for CEA procedures. The average cost per procedure for CAS (US$ 3,062.98) was higher than that for CEA (US$ 1,430.33) (P = 0.008). Conclusions: In Brazil, the frequency of CAS largely surpassed that of CEA. In-hospital mortality rates of CAS were significantly lower than those of CEA, although both had mortality rates within the acceptable rates as dictated by literature. The cost of CAS, however, was significantly higher. This is a pioneering analysis of carotid artery disease management in Brazil that provides, for the first time, preliminary insight into the fact that the low adoption of CEA in the country is in opposition to countries where utilization rates are higher for CEA than for CAS. © 2021","Epidemiological Analysis of 37,424 Carotid Artery Stenosis Intervention Procedures During 11 Years in the Public Health System in Brazil: Stenting has Been More Common Than Endarterectomy","Wolosker N., Portugal M.F.C., da Silva M.F.A., Massaud R., Amaro E., Jr, Jerussalmy C., Teivelis M.P.",2021,Annals of Vascular Surgery,76,,,269,275,,1,10.1016/j.avsg.2021.05.011,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110452308&doi=10.1016%2fj.avsg.2021.05.011&partnerID=40&md5=205703f9f4919a4c98e92d3010da386c,"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil; Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo – USP, São Paulo, Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil","Wolosker, N., Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo – USP, São Paulo, Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil; Portugal, M.F.C., Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil; da Silva, M.F.A., Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil; Massaud, R., Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil; Amaro, E., Jr, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil; Jerussalmy, C., Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil; Teivelis, M.P., Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil",Angioplasty; Carotid Stenosis; Endarterectomy; Revascularization,"Article; Brazil; carotid artery bifurcation; carotid artery obstruction; carotid artery stenting; carotid endarterectomy; comparative study; controlled study; human; in-hospital mortality; major clinical study; mortality rate; public health; reimbursement; revascularization; adverse event; Brazil; carotid artery obstruction; carotid endarterectomy; clinical practice; cost benefit analysis; cost control; diagnostic imaging; economics; endovascular surgery; epidemiology; hospital cost; hospital mortality; mortality; public health; public health systems research; retrospective study; stent; time factor; treatment outcome; Brazil; Carotid Stenosis; Cost Savings; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Endarterectomy, Carotid; Endovascular Procedures; Hospital Costs; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Public Health; Public Health Systems Research; Retrospective Studies; Stents; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","Angioplasty;Carotid Stenosis;Endarterectomy;Revascularization;Article;Brazil;carotid artery bifurcation;carotid artery obstruction;carotid artery stenting;carotid endarterectomy;comparative study;controlled study;human;in-hospital mortality;major clinical study;mortality rate;public health;reimbursement;adverse event;clinical practice;cost benefit analysis;cost control;diagnostic imaging;economics;endovascular surgery;epidemiology;hospital cost;hospital mortality;mortality;public health systems research;retrospective study;stent;time factor;treatment outcome;Cost Savings;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Endarterectomy, Carotid;Endovascular Procedures;Hospital Costs;Humans;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Retrospective Studies;Stents;Time Factors","Portugal, M.F.C.; Avenida Albert Einstein, 627, bloco A1, sala 422, Morumbi, Brazil; email: mafe.portugal@gmail.com",,,,,,Elsevier Inc.,8905096,,AVSUE,34175419,English,Ann.

Public data from procedures performed between 2008 and 2019 were extracted using web scraping techniques,Yes,"Objective: Despite the development of endovascular procedures, open repair remains the gold standard for the treatment of aortic thoracoabdominal aneurysms and some type B dissections, with well-established good outcomes and long-term durability at high-volume centers. The present study described and analyzed public data from patients treated in the public system in a 12-year interval, in a city where more than 5 million inhabitants depend on the Public Health System. Methods: Public data from procedures performed between 2008 and 2019 were extracted using web scraping techniques. The variables available in the database include sex, age, elective or emergency hospital admission, number of surgeries, in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and information on reimbursement values. Results: A total of 556 procedures were analyzed. Of these, 60.79% patients were men, and 41.18% were 65 years of age or older. Approximately 60% had a residential address registered in the municipality. Of all surgeries, 65.83% were elective cases. There were 178 in-hospital deaths (mortality of 32%). In the elective context, there were 98 deaths 26.78% versus 80 deaths (42.10%) in the emergency context (p=0.174). Mortality was lower in the hospitals that performed more surgeries. A total of USD 3,038,753.92 was paid, an average of USD 5,406.95 for elective surgery and USD 5,074.76 for emergency surgery (p=0.536).

This study aimed to describe rates of carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed between 2008 and 2017 in the city of São Paulo through web scraping of publicly available databases,Yes,"Background: Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide with approximately 5.7 million cases/year, and carotid atherosclerosis accounts for 10 to 20% of cases. Methods: In Brazil, the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde [SUS]) is a tax-funded public health care system that provides care for roughly half the population. São Paulo is the eighth largest city in the world with an estimated population of over 12 million people, of whom more than 5 million rely solely on SUS. This study aimed to describe rates of carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed between 2008 and 2017 in the city of São Paulo through web scraping of publicly available databases. Results: Three thousand seven hundred and four carotid revascularization procedures were performed between 2008 and 2017, of which 2,432 were CAS (65.7%). Rates of CAS ranged from 59.9% in 2016 to 86% in 2011. There were 57 in-hospital deaths (1.54%), 34 after CAS (1.4%; 34/2,432) and 23 after CEA (1.81%; 23/1,272) (P = 0.562). SUS reimbursements were US $7,862,017.09 (81.44% of all reimbursements) for 2,432 CAS procedures and US $1,792,324.06 (18.56%) for 1,272 CEA procedures. Average SUS reimbursement for CAS (US $3,232.73) was more than double than that for CEA (US $1,409.05). Conclusions: In a city whose population exceeds that of some European countries, costs of CAS and CEA to the public health care system totaled more than US$ 9 million over 10 years. Epidemiologically, CAS was performed more commonly than CEA with no difference in in-hospital mortality between CAS and CEA, but reimbursements were 2.29 times higher for CAS. The low adoption of CEA in São Paulo is in contrast to countries where utilization rates are higher for CEA than for CAS. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Epidemiological Analysis of Carotid Artery Stenosis Intervention during 10 years in the Public Health System in the Largest City in Brazil: Stenting Has Been More Common than Endarterectomy,"Stabellini N., Wolosker N., Leiderman D.B.D., da Silva M.F.A., Nogueira W.A., Amaro E., Jr., Teivelis M.P.",2020,Annals of Vascular Surgery,66,,,378,384,,7,10.1016/j.avsg.2019.12.040,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078990200&doi=10.1016%2fj.avsg.2019.12.040&partnerID=40&md5=2e8fe7ae99da9f3b15b7c65f40266a2a,"Faculdade Israelita de Ciências da Saúde Albert Einstein (FICSAE), Hospital Israelita -Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil","Stabellini, N., Faculdade Israelita de Ciências da Saúde Albert Einstein (FICSAE), Hospital Israelita -Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; Wolosker, N., Faculdade Israelita de Ciências da Saúde Albert Einstein (FICSAE), Hospital Israelita -Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil; Leiderman, D.B.D., Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil; da Silva, M.F.A., Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil; Nogueira, W.A., Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil; Amaro, E., Jr., Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil; Teivelis, M.P., Faculdade Israelita de Ciências da Saúde Albert Einstein (FICSAE), Hospital Israelita -Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil",,"aged; Article; Brazil; carotid artery obstruction; carotid artery stenting; carotid atherosclerosis; carotid endarterectomy; cerebrovascular accident; comparative study; female; hospital mortality; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; priority journal; public health service; reimbursement; retrospective study; revascularization; adverse event; carotid artery obstruction; carotid endarterectomy; devices; endovascular surgery; epidemiology; factual database; hospital cost; mortality; public health; risk factor; stent; time factor; treatment outcome; Brazil; Carotid Stenosis; Databases, Factual; Endarterectomy, Carotid; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Hospital Costs; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Male; Public Health; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stents; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","aged;Article;Brazil;carotid artery obstruction;carotid artery stenting;carotid atherosclerosis;carotid endarterectomy;cerebrovascular accident;comparative study;female;hospital mortality;human;intermethod comparison;major clinical study;male;priority journal;public health service;reimbursement;retrospective study;revascularization;adverse event;devices;endovascular surgery;epidemiology;factual database;hospital cost;mortality;public health;risk factor;stent;time factor;treatment outcome;Carotid Stenosis;Databases, Factual;Endarterectomy, Carotid;Endovascular Procedures;Hospital Costs;Humans;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Stents;Time Factors","da Silva, M.F.A.; Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, Avenue Albert Einstein, Brazil; email: marcelo.fiorelli96@gmail.com",,,,,,Elsevier Inc.,8905096,,AVSUE,31931132,English,Ann.

" The following public health system data were extracted and analyzed: age, technique, number of surgeries, mortality during hospitalization, length of stay in the establishment (days), and amounts paid by the public network",Yes,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the public data of hysterectomies performed in the only health system in the city of Sao Paulo between 2008 and 2018. METHODS: The following public health system data were extracted and analyzed: age, technique, number of surgeries, mortality during hospitalization, length of stay in the establishment (days), and amounts paid by the public network. RESULTS: A total of 20,119 procedures were analyzed. The most prevalent procedure was total hysterectomy (43.2%), followed by vaginal hysterectomy (26.7%), subtotal hysterectomy (24.3%), and laparoscopic hysterectomy (5.8%). Early discharge (hospital stay of up to 1 day) was more prevalent in cases of vaginal hysterectomy (39%). We observed a marked downward trend in the number of total hysterectomies. Total hysterectomy was the most expensive procedure; no significant difference was noted in the cost of vaginal versus laparoscopic hysterectomy. We noticed a trend of rising costs over the years. The most frequent hospital admission code was that of leiomyoma of the uterus in cases of total, subtotal, and laparoscopic hysterectomy. CONCLUSION: Despite the decrease in the number of hysterectomies over the 11-year study period in Sao Paulo, it remains in high demand mainly for the treatment of uterine leiomyomatosis. Laparoscopic hysterectomy has been gaining ground and showed a slightly upward trend with a shorter hospital stay.

The study was conducted with analysis of data available on the Brazilian Health Ministry’s database platform,Yes,"Background: Worldwide, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a disorder with high morbidity, affecting more than 200 million people. Objectives: Our objective was to analyze surgical treatment for PAD provided on the Brazilian Public Healthcare System over 12 years using publicly available data. Methods: The study was conducted with analysis of data available on the Brazilian Health Ministry’s database platform, assessing distributions of procedures and techniques over the years and their associated mortality and costs. Results: A total of 129,424 procedures were analyzed (performed either for claudication or critical ischemia, proportion unknown). The vast majority of procedures were endovascular (65.49%) and this disproportion exhibited a rising trend (p<0.001). There were 3,306 in-hospital deaths (mortality of 2.55%), with lower mortality in the endovascular group (1.2% vs. 5.0%, p=0.008). The overall governmental expenditure on these procedures was U$ 238,010,096.51, and endovascular procedures were on average significantly more expensive than open surgery (U$ 1,932.27 vs. U$ 1,517.32; p=0.016).

Public and open data referring to all surgeries to treat chronic venous disease between 2008 and 2019 were extracted from the Brazilian Ministry of Health database,Yes,"Background: Varicose vein surgeries are the most commonly performed vascular procedure to treat the most prevalent vascular disease, chronic venous disease. However, nationwide studies on the epidemiology of varicose vein surgeries are scarce, none in developing countries. Therefore, we designed this study to assess the total number of varicose vein surgeries performed between 2008 and 2019 in the Public Health System, which exclusively insures more than 160 million Brazilians, their trends, costs and mortality rates. Methods: Public and open data referring to all surgeries to treat chronic venous disease between 2008 and 2019 were extracted from the Brazilian Ministry of Health database. Results: A total of 869,220 surgeries were performed to treat chronic venous disease in Brazilian public hospitals and outpatient clinics, with an average rate of 4.5 surgeries per 10,000 inhabitants per year. Starting in 2015, we observed a slight non-significant downward trend in the total number of procedures. The total amount reimbursed by the government was US$ 232,775,518.11. A total of 49 deaths were reported after varicose vein surgery, corresponding to a mortality rate of 0.0056%. Conclusions: A total of 869,220 surgeries were performed to treat chronic venous disease over twelve years, with an overall rate of 4.52 procedures per 10,000 population per year.

Review,No,"Accidents by venomous animals are discussed under the historical perspective of state actions. Considered as neglected diseases, they cause social and economic losses in the working age population from rural areas of poor countries, as few of them have public health policies for adequate prophylaxis and treatment; in fact, the largest life losses occur in Africa and Asia. The 46 world producers of antivenin do not meet the global needs, making access to treatment difficult, even in countries with own production. Notification systems lead to inaccurate surveillance surveys and antivenin needs. Despite mandatory notification, Brazil lacks robust databases with full open access in order to allow the timely distribution of antivenin for quality care of these patients. Progress has been made in diagnostic testing, but its application in poor areas is not feasible due to high costs. Improvements in quality antivenin production through good laboratory practices and manufacturing minimize unsatisfactory results of treatments carried out with products of dubious origin. Antivenin development using biotechnology and well-designed clinical trials are key for the treatment of envenoming by agents phylogenetically related from different regions (continental or universal antivenins). International partnerships are fundamental, besides regulatory stocks, similarly to those adopted for vaccines, to supply world demand. The qualification of antivenin will certainly minimize treatment mistakes. Government support to research is a driving force and the most efficient tool for preserving life and avoiding social security surcharges, particularly in developing countries. © 2018, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

"Public and open data on in-hospital mortality due to pulmonary embolism and on rates of inferior vena cava filters placement, its associated diagnosis, and in-hospital mortality in Brazilian public hospitals",No,"Objectives: The primary objective was to study the totality of inferior vena cava filter placements and their temporal and geographic distribution in the Brazilian Public Health System, which insures more than 160 million Brazilians. The secondary objective was to analyze in-hospital mortality after filter placement and deaths due to pulmonary embolism. Methods: Public and open data on in-hospital mortality due to pulmonary embolism and on rates of inferior vena cava filters placement, its associated diagnosis, and in-hospital mortality in Brazilian public hospitals between January 2008 and December 2019 were extracted from Ministry of Health databases. Results: A total of 9108 inferior vena cava filters were placed, 98.18% of which was therapeutic. We observed a significant increase in the use of these devices over the years, from 508 inferior vena cava filters placed in 2008 to 965 in 2019. In-hospital mortality rate in patients who received inferior vena cava filters was 6.21%, stable over time, and 96.64% of causes of these causes were attributed to venous thromboembolism. The in-hospital mortality rate due to pulmonary embolism, regardless of the placement of vena cava filters, has increased significantly. Conclusion: We observed a low but increasing rate of inferior vena cava filter placements in Brazil between 2008 and 2019, most indications were therapeutic. Our findings were heterogeneous across Brazilian regions and contrasted to those observed in the USA, which is likely due to cultural and socioeconomic factors. © The Author(s) 2023.",Epidemiology of the use of inferior vena cava filters in Brazil between 2008 and 2019,"Louzada A.C.S., Diamante Leiderman D.B., Alexandrino da Silva M.F., Cassino Portugal M.F., Carlos de Campos Guerra J., Teivelis M.P., Wolosker N.",2023,Vascular,,,,,,,0,10.1177/17085381231164923,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150905159&doi=10.1177%2f17085381231164923&partnerID=40&md5=f40bb8e210a979e38c0192ecf829444e,"Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; Department of Hematology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; Faculdade Israelita de Ciências da Saúde Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; University of Sao Paulo Medical School, São Paulo, Brazil","Louzada, A.C.S., Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; Diamante Leiderman, D.B., Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; Alexandrino da Silva, M.F., Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; Cassino Portugal, M.F., Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; Carlos de Campos Guerra, J., Department of Hematology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; Teivelis, M.P., Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, Faculdade Israelita de Ciências da Saúde Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; Wolosker, N., Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, Faculdade Israelita de Ciências da Saúde Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, São Paulo, Brazil",big data; deep venous thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; thrombosis; venous thromboembolism,,big data;deep venous thrombosis;pulmonary embolism;thrombosis;venous thromboembolism,"Louzada, A.C.S.; Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Brazil; email: acl604@mail.harvard.edu",,,,,,SAGE Publications Ltd,17085381,,VASCB,36943392,English,Vascular,Article,Scopus,,2-s2.0-85150905159,,Brazil,mail.harvard.edu,,,"Louzada A.C.S., Diamante Leiderman D.B., Alexandrino da Silva M.F., Cassino Portugal M.F., Carlos de Campos Guerra J., Teivelis M.P., Wolosker N.",,
"A new database, the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia Genomic Database (BPGD) was constructed and is now publicly accessible",No,"Background Brazil is exceptionally abundant in medicinal plant resources and has a rich ethnopharmacological history. Brazilian Pharmacopoeia (BP) acts as a national standard that regulates drug quality and has six published editions. Recent genomic approaches have led to a resurgence of interest in herbal drugs. The genomic data of plants has been used for pharmaceutical applications, protecting natural resources, and efficiently regulating the market. However, there are few genomic databases specifically for medicinal plants, and the establishment of a database that focuses on the herbs contained in the BP is urgently required. Methods The medicinal plant species included in each edition of the BP were analyzed to understand the evolution of the Brazilian herbal drugs. The data of 82 plants in the BP were collected and categorized into four sections: DNA barcodes, super-barcodes, genomes, and sequencing data. A typical web server architecture pattern was used to build the database and website. Furthermore, the cp-Gs of the Aloe genus in the database were analyzed as an illustration. Results A new database, the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia Genomic Database (BPGD) was constructed and is now publicly accessible. A BLAST server for species identification and sequence searching with the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), the intergenic region (psbA-trnH), and the chloroplast genome (cp-G) of Brazilian medicinal plants was also embedded in the BPGD. The database has 753 ITS2 of 76 species, 553 psbA-trnH and 190 genomes (whole genome and chloroplast genome) of 57 species. In addition, it contains 37 genome sequence data sets of 24 species and 616 transcriptome sequence data sets of 34 species and also includes 187 cp-Gs representing 57 medicinal species in the BP. Analyses of the six cp-Gs of three Aloe species identified the variable regions in the cp-Gs. These can be used to identify species and understand the intraspecific relationships. Conclusions This study presents the first genomic database of medicinal plants listed in the latest BP. It serves as an efficient platform to obtain and analyze genomic data, accelerate studies regarding Brazilian medicinal plants and facilitate the rational development on their market regulation.",Establishing a genomic database for the medicinal plants in the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia,"Zhou, G.R., Liao, B.S., Li, Q.S., Xu, J., Chen, S.L.",2021,CHINESE MEDICINE,16,1,71,,,10,4,10.1186/s13020-021-00484-5,,"[Zhou, Guan-Ru] Hubei Univ Chinese Med, Inst Pharm, Wuhan 430000, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Guan-Ru; Liao, Bao-Sheng; Li, Qiu-Shi; Xu, Jiang; Chen, Shi-Lin] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Inst Chinese Mat Med, Beijing 100700, Peoples R China",,Genome; Medicinal plants; Brazilian Pharmacopoeia; DNA barcodes; Chloroplast genome; Herbgenomics,NATURAL-PRODUCTS; 1ST EDITION; PHYTOTHERAPY; DRUG; HEALTH,Genome;Medicinal plants;Brazilian Pharmacopoeia;DNA barcodes;Chloroplast genome;Herbgenomics;NATURAL-PRODUCTS;1ST EDITION;PHYTOTHERAPY;DRUG;HEALTH,jxu@icmm.ac.cn; slchen@icmm.ac.cn,,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,,,BMC,1749-8546,,,34353338,English,CHIN MED-UK,Article,WoS,Integrative & Complementary Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,WOS:000681751000001,,China,icmm.ac.cn,Hubei Univ Chinese Med;China Acad Chinese Med Sci,"Hubei Univ Chinese Med, China;China Acad Chinese Med Sci, China","Zhou, Guan-Ru; Liao, Bao-Sheng; Li, Qiu-Shi; Xu, Jiang; Chen, Shi-Lin",,

"we extracted data from National Health Accounts, the WHO-UNICEF Joint Reporting Forms, comprehensive multi-year plans, databases from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's 2019",No,"Background Childhood immunisation is one of the most cost-effective health interventions. However, despite its known value, global access to vaccines remains far from complete. Although supply-side constraints lead to inadequate vaccine coverage in many health systems, there is no comprehensive analysis of the funding for immunisation. We aimed to fill this gap by generating estimates of funding for immunisation disaggregated by the source of funding and the type of activities in order to highlight the funding landscape for immunisation and inform policy making. Methods For this financial modelling study, we estimated annual spending on immunisations for 135 low-income and middle-income countries (as determined by the World Bank) from 2000 to 2017, with a focus on government, donor, and out-of-pocket spending, and disaggregated spending for vaccines and delivery costs, and routine schedules and supplementary campaigns. To generate these estimates, we extracted data from National Health Accounts, the WHO-UNICEF Joint Reporting Forms, comprehensive multi-year plans, databases from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's 2019 development assistance for health database. We estimated total spending on immunisation by aggregating the government, donor, prepaid private, and household spending estimates. Findings Between 2000 and 2017, funding for immunisation totalled US$112.4 billion (95% uncertainty interval 108.5-118.5). Aggregated across all low-income and middle-income countries, government spending consistently remained the largest source of funding, providing between 60.0% (57.7-61.9) and 79.3% (73.8-81.4) of total immunisation spending each year (corresponding to between $2.5 billion [2.3-2.8] and $6.4 billion [6.0-7.0] each year). Across income groups, immunisation spending per surviving infant was similar in low-income and lower-middle-income countries and territories, with average spending of $40 (38-42) in low-income countries and $42 (39-46) in lower-middle-income countries, in 2017. In low-income countries and territories, development assistance made up the largest share of total immunisation spending (69.4% [64.6-72.0]; $630.2 million) in 2017. Across the 135 countries, we observed higher vaccine coverage and increased government spending on immunisation over time, although in some countries, predominantly in Latin America and the Caribbean and in sub-Saharan Africa, vaccine coverage decreased over time, while spending increased. Interpretation These estimates highlight the progress over the past two decades in increasing spending on immunisation. However, many challenges still remain and will require dedication and commitment to ensure that the progress made in the previous decade is sustained and advanced in the next decade for the Immunization Agenda 2030.

cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using data from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informacao de Vigilancia Epidemiologica da Gripe) dataset to characterise the COVID-19,Yes,"Background Brazil ranks second worldwide in total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Understanding the possible socioeconomic and ethnic health inequities is particularly important given the diverse population and fragile political and economic situation. We aimed to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and assess variations in mortality according to region, ethnicity, comorbidities, and symptoms. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using data from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informacao de Vigilancia Epidemiologica da Gripe) dataset to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. In the study, we included hospitalised patients who had a positive RT-PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who had ethnicity information in the dataset. Ethnicity of participants was classified according to the five categories used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics: Branco (White), Preto (Black), Amarelo (East Asian), Indigeno (Indigenous), or Pardo (mixed ethnicity). We assessed regional variations in patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital by state and by two socioeconomically grouped regions (north and central-south). We used mixed-effects Cox regression survival analysis to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation. Findings Of 99 557 patients in the SIVEP-Gripe dataset, we included 11 321 patients in our study. 9278 (82 center dot 0%) of these patients were from the central-south region, and 2043 (18 center dot 0%) were from the north region. Compared with White Brazilians, Pardo and Black Brazilians with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1 center dot 45, 95% CI 1 center dot 33-1 center dot 58 for Pardo Brazilians; 1 center dot 32, 1 center dot 15-1 center dot 52 for Black Brazilians). Pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age) for death. Comorbidities were more common in Brazilians admitted to hospital in the north region than in the central-south, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups. States in the north had higher HRs compared with those of the central-south, except for Rio de Janeiro, which had a much higher HR than that of the other central-south states. Interpretation We found evidence of two distinct but associated effects: increased mortality in the north region (regional effect) and in the Pardo and Black populations (ethnicity effect). We speculate that the regional effect is driven by increasing comorbidity burden in regions with lower levels of socioeconomic development. The ethnicity effect might be related to differences in susceptibility to COVID-19 and access to health care (including intensive care) across ethnicities. Our analysis supports an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect Pardo and Black Brazilians, as well as the population of poorer states, from their higher risk of dying of COVID-19.

Data is not open,No,"Purpose Heavy metals are especially dangerous because of their persistence and toxicity. Soil behaves as a sink of heavy metals by aerial deposition of particles emitted by different human activities. The aims of this work were to identify the levels and sources of heavy metal and trace elements in agricultural and residential areas in Argentina and to evaluate the enrichment of total and HCl-extracted heavy metals. Materials and methods Ninety-four topsoil samples were collected in Cordoba, Argentina (0-10 cm). The majority of the samples were subject to agricultural practices. The possible metal pollution sources were a cement plant and an industrial waste incinerator, a former open-cast uranium mine, petrochemical, and mechanical and metallurgical industries among others. The elements As, Ba, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Eu, Fe, Hf, K, La, Lu, Na, Nd, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Ta, Tb, Th, U, Yb, and Zn were measured by neutron activation analysis, and Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were partially extracted by 0.5-M HCl and measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Several nonparametric statistics were performed to the dataset in order to accomplish the objectives of the study. Results and discussion The mean total Ba concentration exceeded soil quality guidelines for residential areas, with the maximum total As and Co concentrations surpassing the agricultural and residential limits stated in national and international legislations. The elements As and Ba were found to be controlled by parent factors, whereas Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were controlled by both anthropogenic and pedogenic factors. A cement plant was the main source of Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn, whereas lanthanides, Fe, K, U, and also Zn were associated with a former open-cast operation uranium mine. A correlation analysis showed that soil organic matter and pH had strong associations with 0.5-M HCl-extracted Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Conclusions Fe-normalized enrichment factors calculated for 0.5-M HCl-extracted heavy metals are potentially significant for characterizing the element bioavailability, the anthropogenic contamination, and the anomaly assessment. According to soil quality guidelines for environmental health, the human and wildlife populations in Cordoba Province might be experiencing toxic As, Ba, Co, Cr, Ta, U, and Zn effects.

Methods We conducted an interrupted time series analysis with a segmented regression model to analyze if changes in the state's guidelines improved RT-PCR testing outcomes in Brazil's most affluent and largest state, Sao Paulo. Anonymized daily data on the RT-PCR tests conducted in public laboratories belonging to the state-wide network from March 1, 2020 to June 5, 2021 were extracted from the Sao Paulo State open-source database, while the data on the genomic sequences were obtained from GISAID. We then aggregated these data for the 17 regional health departments in the state to evaluate regional-level outcomes. Results The public health system restricted RT-PCR testing to hospitalized cases in the first months. Testing was expanded to permit symptomatic testing of non-hospitalized persons only in July 2020, but a statistically significant increase in surveillance efforts was not observed. Case definition was expanded to allow case confirmation based on clinical, laboratory and image data criteria other than an RT-PCR test without increasing the testing effort for asymptomatic suspicious cases in September 2020. There was an increase in the mean volume of testing in each RHD, but the test positivity rate increased due to insufficient testing expansion. Results also show an uneven improvement in testing outcomes following these changes across the state's regional health departments. Conclusions Evidence suggests that lower RT-PCR testing and genomic surveillance efforts are associated with areas characterized by a higher population concentration and a greater population reliance on the public health system. Our results highlight the need to structure health surveillance and information systems for disease control and prevention in emergency settings considering local demographics and vulnerabilities. In high prevalence settings, efforts at identifying and including vulnerable populations in routine and enhanced surveillance programs during COVID-19 must be significantly improved.","Evaluation of the effectiveness of surveillance policies to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Sao Paulo, Brazil","Barberia, L.G., Moreira, N.D., Kemp, B., Veras, M.A.D.M., Zamudio, M., Rosa, I.S.C., Carvalho, R.D., Sousa, T.C.M.",2022,GLOBAL HEALTH RESEARCH AND POLICY,7,1,27,,,16,0,10.1186/s41256-022-00260-4,,"[Barberia, Lorena G.; Moreira, Natalia de P.; Zamudio, Marcela; Costa Rosa, Isabel Seelaender; Sousa, Tatiane C.

publicly available secondary data?,Yes,"Objective: To use publicly available secondary data to assess the impact of Brazil's Family Health Program on state level infant mortality rates (IMR) during the 1990s. Design: Longitudinal ecological analysis using panel data from secondary sources. Analyses controlled for state level measures of access to clean water and sanitation, average income, women's literacy and fertility, physicians and nurses per 10 000 population, and hospital beds per 1000 population. Additional analyses controlled for immunisation coverage and tested interactions between Family Health Program and proportionate mortality from diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections. Setting: 13 years (1990-2002) of data from 27 Brazilian states. Main results: From 1990 to 2002 IMR declined from 49.7 to 28.9 per 1000 live births. During the same period average Family Health Program coverage increased from 0% to 36%. A 10% increase in Family Health Program coverage was associated with a 4.5% decrease in IMR, controlling for all other health determinants (p<0.01). Access to clean water and hospital beds per 1000 were negatively associated with IMR, while female illiteracy, fertility rates, and mean income were positively associated with IMR. Examination of interactions between Family Health Program coverage and diarrhoea deaths suggests the programme may reduce IMR at least partly through reductions in diarrhoea deaths. Interactions with deaths from acute respiratory infections were ambiguous. Conclusions: The Family Health Program is associated with reduced IMR, suggesting it is an important, although not unique, contributor to declining infant mortality in Brazil. Existing secondary datasets provide an important tool for evaluation of the effectiveness of health services in Brazil.","Evaluation of the impact of the Family Health Program on infant mortality in Brazil, 1990-2002","Macinko J., Guanais F.C., Marinho De Souza M.D.F.",2006,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,60,1,,13,19,,246,10.1136/jech.2005.038323,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29744457721&doi=10.1136%2fjech.2005.038323&partnerID=40&md5=91f3732cf13c556df3e14cfdf1b6a4cb,"Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, New York University, 35 West 4th Street, New York, NY 10012-1172, United States; Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, New York University, New York, NY, United States; Robert F Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, New York University, New York, NY, United States; Faculty of Medicine, University of Sào Paulo, Brazil; University of Cuiabá, Brazil; Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Ministry of Health of Brazil, Brazil","Macinko, J., Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, New York University, 35 West 4th Street, New York, NY 10012-1172, United States, Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, New York University, New York, NY, United States; Guanais, F.C., Robert F Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, New York University, New York, NY, United States; Marinho De Souza, M.D.F., Faculty of Medicine, University of Sào Paulo, Brazil, University of Cuiabá, Brazil, Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Ministry of Health of Brazil, Brazil",,"health monitoring; health services; infant mortality; mortality risk; article; Brazil; data analysis; diarrhea; ecology; family health; female fertility; health care access; health care distribution; health program; human; immunization; income; infant; infant mortality; longitudinal study; reading; respiratory tract infection; sanitation; Brazil; Child Health Services; Child, Preschool; Delivery of Health Care; Developing Countries; Family Health; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Pregnancy; Program Evaluation; Risk Factors; Brazil; South America","health monitoring;health services;infant mortality;mortality risk;article;Brazil;data analysis;diarrhea;ecology;family health;female fertility;health care access;health care distribution;health program;human;immunization;income;infant;longitudinal study;reading;respiratory tract infection;sanitation;Child Health Services;Child, Preschool;Delivery of Health Care;Developing Countries;Female;Health Promotion;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Logistic Models;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Pregnancy;Program Evaluation;Risk Factors;South America","Macinko, J.; Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, 35 West 4th Street, New York, NY 10012-1172, United States; email: james.macinko@nyu.edu",,,,,,,0143005X,,JECHD,16361449,English,J.

Methods: a cross-sectional study using secondary data, considered seven variables of five dimensions in the health system (population’s health conditions, health system coverage, financing, human resources and SUS production) analyzed from a survey of 438 Brazilian regions and adopted factor analysis and cluster models, conditioned by variables, such as: socioeconomic development, offering and service complexity and which resulted in a grouping of five strata. Results: mapping and scheduling based on ISR in health regions in Brazil and a detailed analysis of different indicators that compose them. The regions that showed better performance are in the Southeast, South and Midwest. Conclusions: This article sums efforts of other authors to extend the evaluation studies in health systems in a regional level. In addition, it is expected that the researches broaden their scope and implement the discussions about the process of regionalization in order to provide health policies, a universalized access and care comprehensiveness. © 2017, Instituto Materno Infantil Professor Fernando Figueira.

Review,No,"Objective: To map the evidence on vocal intervention in people over 18 years old. Methods: A literature search was conducted using the following electronic databases: Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS), LIVIVO, Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, SpeechBITE, and Web of Science. Gray literature was also used as an information source through searches on Google Scholar, Open Grey, ProQuest Dissertation and Thesis, and the Brazilian digital library of theses and dissertations. Systematic reviews (SR) with a population of individuals over 18 years old were included. The included reviews addressed speech-language pathology interventions in the vocal area with reports of their respective outcome. The methodological quality of the included systematic reviews was analyzed using the AMSTAR II tool. Quantitative analysis was performed by frequency distribution, and qualitative research was analyzed through narrative synthesis. Results: A total of 2,443 references were retrieved, among which 20 studies met the inclusion criteria. The included studies had critically low quality, lacking the use of population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) components. Among the included SRs, 40% were made in Brazil, 45% were published in the Journal of Voice, and 75% analyzed dysphonic patients. The most frequent intervention was voice therapy (direct therapy associated with indirect therapy approaches). Positive results were observed in most of the outcomes for all studies. Conclusion: Voice therapy was described as inducing positive effects for voice rehabilitation. However, due to the critically low quality of studies, the literature did not enable us to understand the best results for each intervention. Well-designed studies are necessary to clarify the relationship between the intervention goal and how the intervention was evaluated. © 2023 The Voice Foundation",Evidence on Vocal Interventions in Adults: A Scoping Review,"Ribeiro V.V., Nascimento W., da Silva R.C., Goncalves F.M., Santos R.S., Behlau M., de Araujo C.M., Taveira K.V.M.",2023,Journal of Voice,,,,,,,0,10.1016/j.jvoice.2023.03.005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158100065&doi=10.1016%2fj.jvoice.2023.03.005&partnerID=40&md5=47ed9df869484812d1cd734ce0eba47b,"Speech-language Pathology Course, Universidade de Brasília, Brasília, Distrito Federal, Brazil; Associated Postgraduate Program in Speech-Language Pathology, Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Paraíba, João Pessoa, Brazil; Gastrointestinal Physiology Laboratory, Department of Surgery, Hospital de Mataró, Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona, Mataró, Spain; Speech-language Pathology Departament, Universidade Federal de Sergipe, Sergipe, Lagarto, Brazil; Postgraduate Program in Communication Disorders, Universidade Tuiuti do Paraná, Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil; Postgraduate Program in Communication Disorders, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Department of Morphology- Center of Biosciences, Associated Postgraduate Program in Speech-Language Pathology, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Note, Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil","Ribeiro, V.V., Speech-language Pathology Course, Universidade de Brasília, Brasília, Distrito Federal, Brazil, Associated Postgraduate Program in Speech-Language Pathology, Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Paraíba, João Pessoa, Brazil; Nascimento, W., Gastrointestinal Physiology Laboratory, Department of Surgery, Hospital de Mataró, Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona, Mataró, Spain; da Silva, R.C., Speech-language Pathology Departament, Universidade Federal de Sergipe, Sergipe, Lagarto, Brazil; Gonçalves, F.M., Postgraduate Program in Communication Disorders, Universidade Tuiuti do Paraná, Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil; Santos, R.S., Postgraduate Program in Communication Disorders, Universidade Tuiuti do Paraná, Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil; Behlau, M., Postgraduate Program in Communication Disorders, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; de Araujo, C.M., Postgraduate Program in Communication Disorders, Universidade Tuiuti do Paraná, Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil; Taveira, K.V.M., Department of Morphology- Center of Biosciences, Associated Postgraduate Program in Speech-Language Pathology, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Note, Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil",Voice therapy—Voice training—Systematic review—Voice—Voice disorders,,Voice therapy—Voice training—Systematic review—Voice—Voice disorders,"Ribeiro, V.V.; Speech-language Pathology Course, Campus Universitário, Centro Metropolitano, Ceilândia Sul, Brazil; email: fgavanessavr@gmail.com",,,,,,Elsevier Inc.,8921997,,JOVOE,,English,J.

Review,No,"Background: Bibliometric studies are used to analyse and map scientific areas, and study the sci-entific output and impact of institutes and countries. Objectives: Describe the thematic structure and evolution of the field of physical therapy inter-ventions using articles indexed in Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). Also, identify and compare the main producers (countries, institutions) over time (research output, citation impact). Methods: Eligible articles were those indexed in PEDro (1986-2017) and matched to Web of Sci-ence. VOSviewer software, bibliometric text mining, and visualisation techniques were used to evaluate the thematic structure of the included articles. We collected data about authors' coun-try and institutional affiliation, and calculated bibliometric indicators (production, citation impact). Results: A total of 29 090 articles were analysed. Eight topics were identified: ""neurological rehabilitation""; ""methods""; ""exercise for prevention and rehabilitation of lifestyle diseases""; ""assessment and treatment of musculoskeletal pain""; ""physical activity"", ""health promotion and behaviour change""; ""respiratory physical therapy""; ""hospital, primary care and health eco-nomics""; ""cancer and complementary therapies"". The most productive countries were United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. The most impactful countries were United States, France, Finland, and Canada. The most productive institutions were University of Sydney, VU University of Amsterdam, University of Queensland, and University of Toronto. Conclusions: The thematic structure of physical therapy interventions has evolved over time with ""neurological rehabilitation"", ""methods"", ""exercise related to lifestyle diseases"", and ""physical activity"" becoming increasingly important. Main producers of this research were tradi-tionally located in North America and Europe but now include countries like China and Brazil. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

This is not in latinamerica,No,"The leaf-mining moth, Stomphastis thraustica (Meyrick, 1908) was imported to Australia as a potential biological control agent of an exotic weed, bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypiifolia), from Peru. The insect colony has been maintained in the quarantine facility for over eight years but recently, significant mortality was observed in the culture. The larvae demonstrated swollen intersegments with a fragile integument. The infected larvae are cloudy muted green or yellowish whereas a healthy late instar larva is a vivid green. They slowly dehydrate and eventually die, at which point the larval body becomes rubbery and turns to black. We used next generation sequencing to identify the cause of mortality in the insects. Total RNA was extracted from 20 larvae in two cohorts, one with and one without apparent symptoms of disease, for deep sequencing on NovaSeq platform after eukaryote ribosomal RNA depletion. We identified several non-insect sequences belonging to viruses, bacteria, and fungi, but none of those showed significant abundance or enrichment in the infected dataset. The sequences related to a unicellular yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and they were among the highly expressed non-insect contigs; more than 5% of reads in both libraries mapped to the genome of this opportunistic microorganism.

They are not mentioning the dataset used,No,"Objectives Despite the enormous advances in the field, most evidence about functional ability trajectories in old age comes from studies conducted in developed and high-income countries. This research aims to build on these previous advances to examine functional ability trajectories in Chile. Method Drawing on a robust, publicly available 15-year panel data set (2004-2018), and using sequence analysis, we examine functional ability trajectories types among 4 age groups (people aged 46-50, 51-55, 56-60, and 61-64 at baseline). Then, we analyze trajectories' dynamics looking at intraindividual health-declining and health-recovery transitions between functional ability statuses, within each trajectory type. Finally, we assess how multiple baseline individual characteristics predict the likelihood of following a functional ability trajectory type, using multinomial regression models. Results Across all age groups, an important fraction (between 26% and 50%) reports stable healthy trajectories, and between 10% and 20% follow equivocal-declining trajectories (i.e., exhibiting both health-declining and health-recovery intraindividual transitions), suggesting that age might not be the main source of heterogeneity in functional ability trajectories. Overall, women, lower educated people, nonworking individuals, and people with a higher burden of chronic conditions at baseline are more prevalent among health-declining trajectory types; however, these results are not constant across the age groups analyzed. Discussion This nationally focused study reinforces the feasibility and usefulness of an in-depth analysis of functional ability trajectories in old age. The study findings can be crucial to define different prevention strategies according to the functional ability path that an individual might follow, especially in countries like Chile that currently navigate the challenges of population aging.",Extending the Analysis of Functional Ability Trajectories to Unexplored National Contexts: The Case of Chile,"Madero-Cabib, I., Dintrans, P.V., Salas, J.B.",2022,JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES,77,7,,1280,1293,14,4,10.1093/geronb/gbab116,,"[Madero-Cabib, Ignacio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Santiago, Chile; [Madero-Cabib, Ignacio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Salud Publ, Santiago, Chile; [Madero-Cabib, Ignacio] Millennium Nucleus Study Life Course & Vulnerabil, Santiago, Chile; [Villalobos Dintrans, Pablo] Univ Santiago, Fac Ciencias Med, Programa Ctr Salud Publ, Santiago, Chile; [Browne Salas, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Med, Div Med Interna, Secc Geriatria, Santiago, Chile",,Chile; Disability; Functional ability; Life course; Trajectory,OLDER-ADULTS; DISABILITY TRAJECTORIES; LIFE; LIMITATIONS; HISTORY; MEXICO; AGE,Chile;Disability;Functional ability;Life course;Trajectory;OLDER-ADULTS;DISABILITY TRAJECTORIES;LIFE;LIMITATIONS;HISTORY;MEXICO;AGE,pvillalobos.d@gmail.com,,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",,,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,1079-5014,,,34181007,English,J GERONTOL B-PSYCHOL,Article,WoS,Geriatrics & Gerontology; Psychology,WOS:000755887800001,2-s2.0-85129610006,Chile,gmail.com,Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile;Millennium Nucleus Study Life Course & Vulnerabil;Univ Santiago,"Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Chile;Millennium Nucleus Study Life Course & Vulnerabil, Chile;Univ Santiago, Chile","Madero-Cabib, Ignacio; Villalobos Dintrans, Pablo; Browne Salas, Jorge",,
"Two (N=2) benchmark datasets from the database of the Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University in Brazil",Yes,"Modern developments in the state-of-the-art open-source activation functions for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have broadened the selection of benchmark activations for Deep Learning (DL)-aided classification. Nevertheless, achieving discrimination of non-linear input image data in CNN is still not straightforward and it is unclear how such novel activation functions can have translational applications with tangible impact. hyper-sinh, made freely available in TensorFlow and Keras, was demonstrated as a benchmark activation function on five (N=5) datasets in its ground-breaking paper. Measuring the value from deploying this activation in a specific application is pivotal to supply the required evidence of its performance on real-life supervised DL-based image classification tasks. In this study, a CNN was for the first time combined with hyper-sinh to aid early detection of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) from discriminating pathophysiological patterns extracted from spiral drawings. Thus, the hyper-sinh activation was deployed tomaximise the separability of the input features from spiral drawings via automated pattern recognition. We demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of hyper-sinh-CNN to aid early diagnosis of PD, evaluated against other gold standard activation functions, including the recent Quantum ReLU (QReLU) and the modified Quantum ReLU (m-QReLU) that solved the ‘dying ReLU’ problem for the first time in the literature of DL. Two (N=2) benchmark datasets from the database of the Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University in Brazil, scaled to be in 28 by 28 pixels as the MNIST benchmark data, were used to discriminate between input image patterns of 158 subjects (53 healthy controls and 105 patients with PD) from spirals drawn on graphics tablets. Overtraining was avoided via early stopping and the models were developed and tested in TensorFlow and Keras (Python 3.6). The supervised model (hyper-sinh-CNN) could detect early Parkinson’s Disease with 81% and 91% classification accuracy from the two datasets respectively (F1-scores: 73% and 91% correspondingly). Furthermore, the model achieved high sensitivity (81% and 91%). Thus, this study validates the application of hyper-sinh to aid real-life supervised DL-based image classification, in particular early diagnosis of PD from spiral drawings. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

This is in US,No,"Background After claiming nearly five hundred thousand lives globally, the COVID-19 pandemic is showing no signs of slowing down. While the UK, USA, Brazil and parts of Asia are bracing themselves for the second wave-or the extension of the first wave-it is imperative to identify the primary social, economic, environmental, demographic, ethnic, cultural and health factors contributing towards COVID-19 infection and mortality numbers to facilitate mitigation and control measures. Methods We process several open-access datasets on US states to create an integrated dataset of potential factors leading to the pandemic spread. We then apply several supervised machine learning approaches to reach a consensus as well as rank the key factors. We carry out regression analysis to pinpoint the key pre-lockdown factors that affect post-lockdown infection and mortality, informing future lockdown-related policy making. Findings Population density, testing numbers and airport traffic emerge as the most discriminatory factors, followed by higher age groups (above 40 and specifically 60+). Post-lockdown infected and death rates are highly influenced by their pre-lockdown counterparts, followed by population density and airport traffic. While healthcare index seems uncorrelated with mortality rate, principal component analysis on the key features show two groups: states (1) forming early epicenters and (2) experiencing strong second wave or peaking late in rate of infection and death. Finally, a small case study on New York City shows that days-to-peak for infection of neighboring boroughs correlate better with inter-zone mobility than the inter-zone distance. Interpretation States forming the early hotspots are regions with high airport or road traffic resulting in human interaction. US states with high population density and testing tend to exhibit consistently high infected and death numbers. Mortality rate seems to be driven by individual physiology, preexisting condition, age etc., rather than gender, healthcare facility or ethnic predisposition. Finally, policymaking on the timing of lockdowns should primarily consider the pre-lockdown infected numbers along with population density and airport traffic.",Factors affecting COVID-19 infected and death rates inform lockdown-related policymaking,"Roy, S., Ghosh, P.",2020,PLOS ONE,15,10,e0241165,,,18,58,10.1371/journal.pone.0241165,,"[Roy, Satyaki] Univ N Carolina, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Ghosh, Preetam] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Richmond, VA USA",,,,,satyakir@unc.edu,,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",,,,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,1932-6203,,,33095811,English,PLOS ONE,Article,WoS,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000586649400001,2-s2.0-85094611965,United States,unc.edu,Univ N Carolina;Virginia Commonwealth Univ,"Univ N Carolina, United States;Virginia Commonwealth Univ, United States","Roy, Satyaki; Ghosh, Preetam",,
Twenty years (2000-2020) of sanitation coverage data were extracted from the JMP database and visualized,No,"An equitable sanitation coverage promotes sustainability, economic prosperity, and public health protection. This study examined factors affecting sanitation coverage and the potential of selected countries across three income levels (Low-Income, Lower-Middle, and Upper-Middle Income Countries) to meet Sustainable Development Goal 6.2 by developing a Sanitation Coverage Index (SCI). Nine developing countries were selected based on the following sets of criteria: income level, population, and geographical region. Twenty years (2000-2020) of sanitation coverage data were extracted from the JMP database and visualized. The SCI was developed using the service level criteria and examined the local drivers of poor sanitation coverage. Findings show that all countries studied made good progress and have commendable current status, except Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Nigeria. Nigeria has the highest open defecation coverage and may not meet the 2030 target. The SCI result shows that Turkey, Ukraine, and China have excellent coverage (scoring: 44, 43, and 40). Brazil, Bangladesh, and DPR Korea have satisfactory performances (36, 31, and 31), while Nigeria, Rwanda, and Ethiopia recorded unsatisfactory progress (28, 27, and 16). The strongest factors influencing poor coverage include population, high socioeconomic inequalities, and socio-political challenges.

This is not an open db,No,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the level of access to physical rehabilitation for survivors of traffic accidents and the associated factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study performed in Natal, Northeastern Brazil, through a telephone survey of 155 victims of traffic accidents admitted to an emergency hospital between January and August of 2013, with a diagnosis of fracture, traumatic brain injury or amputation. Participants were identified in the database of the reference hospital for care of traffic accident victims. We calculated point estimates and confidence interval (95%CI) for the frequency of subjects who had access, in addition to multivariate analysis (logistic regression) between access (dependent variable) and sociodemographic, clinical, and assistance variables. RESULTS: Among the 155 respondents, the majority were adolescents and adults between 15–29 years of age (47.7%), men (82.6%), education up to high school (92.3%), income of up to two minimum wages (78.0%) and bikers (75.5%). Although 85.8% of traffic accident survivors reported the need for physical rehabilitation, there was little access (51.6%; 95%CI 43.7–59.4) and a delay to start the physical rehabilitation (average = 67 days). We classified factors associated with access to physical rehabilitation as: (i) unmodifiable individuals in the short term – family income greater than two minimum wages (OR = 3.7), informal worker (OR = 0.11) or unemployed (OR = 0.15) and possession of a private health care plan (OR = 0.07); and (ii) assistance modifiable by service management – written referral for physical rehabilitation (OR = 27.5) and perceived need of physical rehabilitation (OR = 10). CONCLUSIONS: This study found a low and slow access to physical rehabilitation for individuals potentially in need. The associated factors were the organizational processes of health care (health information and referral) and social determinants (income, occupation and private health care plan) cpy:This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided that the original author and source are credited © 2017,Revista de Saúde Publica.All Rights Reserved.",Factors Associated With Access To Physical Rehabilitation For Victims Of Traffic Accidents,"de Meneses Sousa K., de Oliveira W.I.F., Alves E.A., da Silva Gama Z.A.",2017,Revista de Saude Publica,51,,54,,,,3,10.1590/S1518-8787.2017051006429,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029667839&doi=10.1590%2fS1518-8787.2017051006429&partnerID=40&md5=559761eb771b724216370ca91010a2c2,"Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Saúde Coletiva, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, RN, Brazil; Instituto Federal de Educacao, Ciencia e Tecnologia do Rio Grande do Norte, Sao Paulo do Potengi, RN, Brazil; Curso de Medicina, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, RN, Brazil; Departamento de Saúde Coletiva, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, RN, Brazil","de Meneses Sousa, K., Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Saúde Coletiva, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, RN, Brazil; de Oliveira, W.I.F., Instituto Federal de Educacao, Ciencia e Tecnologia do Rio Grande do Norte, Sao Paulo do Potengi, RN, Brazil; Alves, E.A., Curso de Medicina, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, RN, Brazil; da Silva Gama, Z.A., Departamento de Saúde Coletiva, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, RN, Brazil",Accidents; Health services accessibility; Quality of health care; Rehabilitation services; Traffic,"adolescent; adult; aged; amputation; Article; Brazil; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dependent variable; emergency ward; female; health care planning; health service; human; logistic regression analysis; male; middle aged; observational study; rehabilitation center; school child; sociodemographics; telephone interview; traffic accident; traumatic brain injury; unemployment; very elderly; victim; young adult; age distribution; health care delivery; physiotherapy; private sector; public sector; questionnaire; sex ratio; socioeconomics; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; time factor; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brazil; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Physical Therapy Modalities; Private Sector; Public Sector; Sex Distribution; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Young Adult","Accidents;Health services accessibility;Quality of health care;Rehabilitation services;Traffic;adolescent;adult;aged;amputation;Article;Brazil;child;controlled study;cross-sectional study;dependent variable;emergency ward;female;health care planning;health service;human;logistic regression analysis;male;middle aged;observational study;rehabilitation center;school child;sociodemographics;telephone interview;traffic accident;traumatic brain injury;unemployment;very elderly;victim;young adult;age distribution;health care delivery;physiotherapy;private sector;public sector;questionnaire;sex ratio;socioeconomics;statistical model;statistics and numerical data;time factor;Accidents, Traffic;Aged, 80 and over;Cross-Sectional Studies;Humans;Logistic Models;Physical Therapy Modalities;Sex Distribution;Socioeconomic Factors;Surveys and Questionnaires;Time Factors","de Meneses Sousa, K.; Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Saúde Coletiva, Brazil; email: kelienny@gmail.com",,,,,,Universidade de Sao Paulo.

Is not a health db,No,"This study is focused on the identification of the faecal virome of healthy chickens raised in high-density, export-driven poultry farms in Brazil. Following high-throughput sequencing, a total of 7743 de novo-assembled contigs were constructed and compared with known nucleotide/amino acid sequences from the GenBank database. Analyses with BLASTx revealed that 279 contigs (4 %) were related to sequences of eukaryotic viruses. Viral genome sequences (total or partial) indicative of members of recognized viral families, including Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae and Reoviridae, were identified, some of those representing novel genotypes. In addition, a range of circular replication-associated protein encoding DNA viruses were also identified. The characterization of the faecal virome of healthy chickens described here not only provides a description of the viruses encountered in such niche but should also represent a baseline for future studies comparing viral populations in healthy and diseased chicken flocks. Moreover, it may also be relevant for human health, since chickens represent a significant proportion of the animal protein consumed worldwide.","Faecal virome of healthy chickens reveals a large diversity of the eukaryote viral community, including novel circular ssDNA viruses","Lima, D.A., Cibulski, S.P., Finkler, F., Teixeira, T.F., Varela, A.P.M., Cerva, C., Loiko, M.R., Scheffer, C.M., dos Santos, H.F., Mayer, F.Q., Roehe, P.M.",2017,JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY,98,4,,690,703,14,45,10.1099/jgv.0.000711,,"[Lima, Diane A.; Finkler, Fabrine; Teixeira, Thais F.; Varela, Ana Paula M.; Cerva, Cristine; Loiko, Marcia R.; Scheffer, Camila M.; dos Santos, Helton F.; Mayer, Fabiana Q.; Roehe, Paulo M.] FEPAGRO Saude Anim, IPVDF, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Lima, Diane A.; Finkler, Fabrine; Teixeira, Thais F.; Varela, Ana Paula M.; Cerva, Cristine; Loiko, Marcia R.; Scheffer, Camila M.; dos Santos, Helton F.; Roehe, Paulo M.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, ICBS, Dept Microbiol Imunol & Parasitol, Lab Virol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Cibulski, Samuel P.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Fac Vet, Lab Virol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",,fecal; virome; broilers; high-throughput sequencing,AVIAN GYROVIRUS 2; COMPLETE GENOME SEQUENCE; STRANDED-DNA VIRUS; OPEN READING FRAME; ANEMIA VIRUS; GENETIC-CHARACTERIZATION; METAGENOMIC ANALYSES; STOOL SAMPLES; IDENTIFICATION; FAMILY,fecal;virome;broilers;high-throughput sequencing;AVIAN GYROVIRUS 2;COMPLETE GENOME SEQUENCE;STRANDED-DNA VIRUS;OPEN READING FRAME;ANEMIA VIRUS;GENETIC-CHARACTERIZATION;METAGENOMIC ANALYSES;STOOL SAMPLES;IDENTIFICATION;FAMILY,diane.lima@yahoo.com.br,,"14-16 MEREDITH ST, LONDON, ENGLAND",,,,MICROBIOLOGY SOC,0022-1317,,,28100302,English,J GEN VIROL,Article,WoS,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Virology,WOS:000401905000020,,Brazil,yahoo.com.br,FEPAGRO Saude Anim;Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul,"FEPAGRO Saude Anim, Brazil;Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Lima, Diane A.; Cibulski, Samuel P.; Finkler, Fabrine; Teixeira, Thais F.; Varela, Ana Paula M.; Cerva, Cristine; Loiko, Marcia R.; Scheffer, Camila M.; dos Santos, Helton F.; Mayer, Fabiana Q.; Roehe, Paulo M.",,
Data from Colombia were extracted from the 2013 and 2014 administrative Databases of the Contributory Regime (DCR) of the Social Security System in Health (SSSH) of Colombia,Yes,"BACKGROUND: Major disparities in complications and mortality after appendectomy between countries with different income levels have not been well characterized, as comparative studies at patient level between countries are scant. This study aimed to investigate variations in postoperative complications, mortality, and failure to rescue after appendectomy between a high-income country and a low-to-middle-income country. METHODS: Hospital discharges on adult patients who underwent appendectomy were extracted from administrative databases from Colombia and 2 states of the United States (Florida and New York). Outcomes included major postoperative complications, in-hospital mortality, and failure to rescue. Univariate analyses were conducted to compare outcomes between the 2 countries. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the independent effect of country on outcomes after adjustment for patient age, sex, comorbidity index, severity of appendicitis, and appendectomy route (laparoscopic/open). RESULTS: A total of 62,338 cases from Colombia and 57,987 from the United States were included in the analysis. Patients in Colombia were significantly younger and healthier but had a higher incidence of peritonitis. Use of laparoscopy was significantly lower in Colombia (5.9% vs 89.4%; P <.0001). After adjustment for covariates, multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that compared to the United States, Colombia had lower complication rates (2.8% vs 6.6%; odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.44; P <.0001) but higher mortality (0.44% vs 0.08%; OR, 8.92; 95% CI, 5.69-13.98; P <.0001) and failure to rescue (13.6% vs 1.0%; OR, 17.01; 95% CI, 10.66-27.16; P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite lower rates of postoperative complications, in-hospital mortality after appendectomy was higher in Colombia than in the United States. This difference may be explained by higher rates of failure to rescue in the low-to-middle-income country (ie, decreased ability of Colombian hospitals to rescue patients from complications). © 2022 International Anesthesia Research Society.",Failure to Rescue and Mortality Differences after Appendectomy in a Low-Middle-Income Country and the United States,"Rosero E.B., Eslava-Schmalbach J., Garzon-Orjuela N., Buitrago G., Joshi G.P.",2023,Anesthesia and Analgesia,136,6,,1030,1038,,0,10.1213/ANE.0000000000006336,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159765323&doi=10.1213%2fANE.0000000000006336&partnerID=40&md5=d4b3f9dc5a70c6921493ba5e3a5bacec,"Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Management, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, United States; Health Equity Research Group, School of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia; Clinical Research Institute, School of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia","Rosero, E.B., Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Management, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, United States; Eslava-Schmalbach, J., Health Equity Research Group, School of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia; Garzón-Orjuela, N., Health Equity Research Group, School of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia; Buitrago, G., Clinical Research Institute, School of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia; Joshi, G.P., Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Management, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, United States",,acute appendicitis; adult; aged; appendectomy; Article; Colombia; comorbidity; controlled study; failure to rescue (health care); female; Florida; high income country; hospital discharge; human; in-hospital mortality; laparoscopy; low income country; major clinical study; male; middle income country; mortality; mortality rate; New York; peritonitis; postoperative complication; sensitivity analysis; surgical mortality; United States; appendectomy; appendicitis; hospital; laparoscopy; length of stay; postoperative complication; retrospective study; treatment outcome; United States; Adult; Appendectomy; Appendicitis; Florida; Hospitals; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; United States,acute appendicitis;adult;aged;appendectomy;Article;Colombia;comorbidity;controlled study;failure to rescue (health care);female;Florida;high income country;hospital discharge;human;in-hospital mortality;laparoscopy;low income country;major clinical study;male;middle income country;mortality;mortality rate;New York;peritonitis;postoperative complication;sensitivity analysis;surgical mortality;United States;appendicitis;hospital;length of stay;retrospective study;treatment outcome;Hospitals;Humans;Postoperative Complications;Retrospective Studies,"Rosero, E.B.; Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Management, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, MC 9202, United States; email: eric.rosero@utsouthwestern.edu",,,,,,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,32999,,AACRA,36728930,English,Anesth.

"Contextual data were collected from official publicly accessible databases of the Brazilian government, at the municipal level",Yes,"This study aimed to assess the prevalence of non-use of health services in the last year by people with Chagas disease (CD) in an endemic area in Brazil and the contextual and individual factors associated with this non-use. This is a multilevel study that considered contextual and individual data. Contextual data were collected from official publicly accessible databases of the Brazilian government, at the municipal level. The individual data came from the first follow-up of a Brazilian cohort that assessed patients with CD in 21 municipali-ties in endemic area for the disease. The sample consisted of 1,160 individuals with CD. The dependent variable “use of health services in the last year” was categorized as yes vs. no. The analysis was performed using Poisson regression with robust variance. The prevalence of non-use of health services in the last year was 23.5% (IC95%: 21.1–25.9). The contextual factor “larger population” (PR: 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2–2.0) and individual factors related to the lower severity of the disease as a functional class without limitations (PR: 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2–2.1) and unaltered N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide levels (PR: 2.2; 95% CI = 1.3–3.6) increased the prevalence of non-use of the health service in the last year by people with CD. The results of this study showed that individual determinants are not isolated pro-tagonists of the non-use of health services in the last year by people with CD, which rein-forces the need for public policies that consider the contextual determinants of the use of health services by populations affected by the disease. © 2022 Damasceno et al.",Failure to use health services by people with Chagas disease: Multilevel analysis of endemic area in Brazil,"Damasceno R.F., Sabino E.C., Ribeiro A.L.P., Ferreira A.M., de Oliveira-Da Silva L.C., Oliveira C.D.L., Cardoso C.S., Vieira T.M., Haikal D.S.A.",2022,PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,16,9,e0010785,,,,0,10.1371/journal.pntd.0010785,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139380485&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pntd.0010785&partnerID=40&md5=104f047b250bba57a142a8f649e7f767,"Graduate Program in Health Sciences, State University of Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Montes Claros, Brazil; Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Department of Internal Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Federal University of São João del-Rey, Research Group in Epidemiology and New Technologies in Health–Centro Oeste Campus, Minas Gerais, Divinópolis, Brazil","Damasceno, R.F., Graduate Program in Health Sciences, State University of Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Montes Claros, Brazil; Sabino, E.C., Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Ribeiro, A.L.P., Department of Internal Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Ferreira, A.M., Graduate Program in Health Sciences, State University of Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Montes Claros, Brazil; de Oliveira-Da Silva, L.C., Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Oliveira, C.D.L., Federal University of São João del-Rey, Research Group in Epidemiology and New Technologies in Health–Centro Oeste Campus, Minas Gerais, Divinópolis, Brazil; Cardoso, C.S., Federal University of São João del-Rey, Research Group in Epidemiology and New Technologies in Health–Centro Oeste Campus, Minas Gerais, Divinópolis, Brazil; Vieira, T.M., Graduate Program in Health Sciences, State University of Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Montes Claros, Brazil; Haikal, D.S.A., Graduate Program in Health Sciences, State University of Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Montes Claros, Brazil",,"amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; brain natriuretic peptide; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; Chagas disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; daily life activity; dependent variable; diabetes mellitus; electrocardiogram; endemic disease; female; follow up; health insurance; health service; human; hypertension; IC95; income; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multilevel analysis; physical activity; Poisson regression; prevalence; quality of life; self report; smoking; telehealth; Trypanosoma cruzi; vulnerability; Brazil; Chagas disease; cross-sectional study; health service; multilevel analysis; socioeconomics; Brazil; Chagas Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Services; Humans; Multilevel Analysis; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Socioeconomic Factors","amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide;brain natriuretic peptide;adult;alcohol consumption;Article;Chagas disease;cohort analysis;controlled study;daily life activity;dependent variable;diabetes mellitus;electrocardiogram;endemic disease;female;follow up;health insurance;health service;human;hypertension;IC95;income;lifestyle;major clinical study;male;middle aged;multilevel analysis;physical activity;Poisson regression;prevalence;quality of life;self report;smoking;telehealth;Trypanosoma cruzi;vulnerability;Brazil;cross-sectional study;socioeconomics;Cross-Sectional Studies;Health Services;Humans;Natriuretic Peptide, Brain;Socioeconomic Factors","Damasceno, R.F.; Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Minas Gerais, Brazil; email: damascenoenf@gmail.com",,,,,,Public Library of Science,19352727,,,36121849,English,PLoS.

We obtained regional-and national-level incidence data from 48 population-based cancer registries in 13 countries and cancer deaths from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries,Yes,"Rationale and objective: The burden of breast cancer has increased worldwide. Breast cancer mortality has been increasing in Central and South America (CSA) in the last few decades. We describe the current burden of breast cancer in CSA and review the current status of disease control. Methods: We obtained regional-and national-level incidence data from 48 population-based cancer registries in 13 countries and cancer deaths from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries. We estimated world population age-standardized incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 person-years for 2003-2007 and the estimated annual percentage change to describe time trends. Results: In the most recent 5-year period, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay had the highest incidence rates (67.7-71.9) and Bolivia and El Salvador had the lowest (7.9-12.7). For most countries, mortality rates were <= 12.3, except in Uruguay, Argentina and Cuba (14.9-20.5). Age-specific rates increased after the age of 40-50 years and reached a maximum after age 65 years (mean age at diagnosis 56-62 years). Most countries have developed national screening guidelines; however, there is limited capacity for screening. Conclusion: The geographic variation of breast cancer rates may be explained by differences in the prevalence of reproductive patterns, lifestyle factors, early detection, and healthcare access. Extending early-detection programs is challenging because of inequalities in healthcare access and coverage, limited funding, and inadequate infrastructure, and thus it may not be feasible. Given the current status of breast cancer in CSA, data generated by population-based cancer registries is urgently needed for effective planning for cancer control.

Review,No,"There is a global trend towards the private sector’s growing participation in training healthcare professionals, influenced by public policies. In Brazil, private medical schools have developed and expanded with government financing, more recently with support from the More Doctors Program. The study aimed to describe and analyze movements in the corporate reconfiguration of the educational sector, with trends towards oligopolization and financialization related to the recent expansion of medical education in Brazil. An exploratory qualitative and quantitative approach was used, associated with various methodological strategies, to overcome the limitations in access to information, with data collection from open-access secondary databases. The private sector now accounts for 60% of the course supply and 69% of enrollment in medicine, 31% of which is supplied by ten educational groups. The groups studied here highlight the dynamic educational market, mechanisms of financialization and concentration, and formation of an oligopoly in the supply of higher education, particularly in medical training. There has been a trend towards concentration of the supply of institutions of higher learning since 2000. The largest groups employ similar management strategies, expansion of their market share, shareholder format, business diversification, and uptake of investors and financial capital. Government programs like the More Doctors Program helped expand and concentrate the private educational sector with government transfers or advance financing. The trend has been towards oligopolization and financialization. © 2022 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

"They are measuring the price of fruits, I don't know how relevant it is",No,"The study aimed to verify the validity of secondary data in the investigation of the food environment and to analyze the characteristics of the community environment and consumers in territories covered by a health promotion service. This was an ecological study in 18 units of the Health Academy Program in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, selected by simple cluster sampling. Validation of the establishments marketing fruits and vegetables, obtained from public databases, was done via telephone contact, Google Street View, and on-site audit. The following variables were investigated in the community food environment: type and location of the establishment; consumer’s environment: availability, variety, price, and advertising of fruits and vegetables; availability and variety of ultra-processed foods; and hygienic and sanitary conditions. The access to healthy foods index was used to measure access to these foods. The on-site audit revealed weak concordance (45.7%) with the secondary databases. Of the 298 establishments, the majority were bulk grocery stores and open-air markets (61.3%), which showed the highest availability of healthy foods, but also marketed large amounts of ultra-processed foods (60.7%). One-third of the establishments showed substandard hygienic and sanitary conditions. The secondary databases showed low validity, emphasizing the need to audit the establishments. The establishments also showed a striking presence of ultra-processed foods and poor hygiene and sanitation. © 2018, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

The data used in this work is obtained from publicly available John Hopkins University's COVID-19 database,Yes,"Most countries are reopening or considering lifting the stringent prevention policies such as lockdowns, consequently, daily coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases (confirmed, recovered and deaths) are increasing significantly. As of July 25th, there are 16.5 million global cumulative confirmed cases, 9.4 million cumulative recovered cases and 0.65 million deaths. There is a tremendous necessity of supervising and estimating future COVID-19 cases to control the spread and help countries prepare their healthcare systems. In this study, time-series models - Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) are used to forecast the epidemiological trends of the COVID-19 pandemic for top-16 countries where 70%-80% of global cumulative cases are located. Initial combinations of the model parameters were selected using the auto-ARIMA model followed by finding the optimized model parameters based on the best fit between the predictions and test data. Analytical tools Auto-Correlation function (ACF), Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used to assess the reliability of the models. Evaluation metrics Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) were used as criteria for selecting the best model. A case study was presented where the statistical methodology was discussed in detail for model selection and the procedure for forecasting the COVID-19 cases of the USA. Best model parameters of ARIMA and SARIMA for each country are selected manually and the optimized parameters are then used to forecast the COVID-19 cases. Forecasted trends for confirmed and recovered cases showed an exponential rise for countries such as the United States, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Bangladesh, India, Mexico and Pakistan. Similarly, trends for cumulative deaths showed an exponential rise for countries Brazil, South Africa, Chile, Colombia, Bangladesh, India, Mexico, Iran, Peru, and Russia. SARIMA model predictions are more realistic than that of the ARIMA model predictions confirming the existence of seasonality in COVID-19 data. The results of this study not only shed light on the future trends of the COVID-19 outbreak in top-16 countries but also guide these countries to prepare their health care policies for the ongoing pandemic.

"The number of hospital admissions due to asthma and non-respiratory diseases, as well as the amount spent with asthma hospitalization, were obtained from DATASUS",Yes,"Background: Since June 2011, the Brazilian health system started providing asthma medications (beclomethasone and salbutamol), totally free of charge to patients with asthma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the provision of free asthma medications on hospital admissions for asthma in Brazil, using a national hospitalization database (DATASUS), comparing the incidence of hospital admissions before and after the free supply of these drugs. Methods: Admissions of patients with 1-49 years of age by the Brazilian public health system with the diagnosis of asthma were compared pre (2008-2010) and post (2012-2014) provision of free medicines (beclomethasone and salbutamol). The number of hospital admissions due to asthma and non-respiratory diseases, as well as the amount spent with asthma hospitalization, were obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian government open-access public health database system. Results: Admission rates for asthma significantly decreased from 90.09/100.000 (2008-2010) to 59.85/100.000 (2012-2014), when the period pre and post provision of free medicines were compared [OR 0.67 (CI 0.48-0.92)]. Non-respiratory admission rates remained stable, when both periods were also compared. Conclusion: Asthma hospitalization rates significantly decreased in the three-year period after the provision of free medicines to treat asthma. Our findings suggest that the provision of free medications for asthma may have a particular public health impact by its own in developing countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"These sequences were generated by the NIC or the WHO Collaborating Center (CC) at the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform",No,"Objective Since the 2009 influenza pandemic, Latin American (LA) countries have strengthened their influenza surveillance systems. We analyzed influenza genetic sequence data from the 2017 through 2018 Southern Hemisphere (SH) influenza season from selected LA countries, to map the availability of influenza genetic sequence data from, and to describe, the 2017 through 2018 SH influenza seasons in LA. Methods We analyzed influenza A/H1pdm09, A/H3, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata hemagglutinin sequences from clinical samples from 12 National Influenza Centers (NICs) in ten countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay) with a collection date from epidemiologic week (EW) 18, 2017 through EW 43, 2018. These sequences were generated by the NIC or the WHO Collaborating Center (CC) at the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform, and used for phylogenetic reconstruction. Findings Influenza hemagglutinin sequences from the participating countries (A/H1pdm09 n = 326, A/H3 n = 636, B n = 433) were highly concordant with the genetic groups of the influenza vaccine-recommended viruses for influenza A/H1pdm09 and influenza B. For influenza A/ H3, the concordance was variable. Conclusions Considering the constant evolution of influenza viruses, high-quality surveillance data—specifically genetic sequence data, are important to allow public health decision makers to make informed decisions about prevention and control strategies, such as influenza vaccine composition. Countries that conduct influenza genetic sequencing for surveillance in LA should continue to work with the WHO CCs to produce high-quality genetic sequence data and upload those sequences to open-access databases. © 2020 Leite et al.

They don't mention where the reseach is!,No,"The Zika virus (ZIKV) disease caused a public health emergency of international concern that started in February 2016. The overall number of ZIKV-related cases increased until November 2016, after which it declined sharply. While the evaluation of the potential risk and impact of future arbovirus epidemics remains challenging, intensified surveillance efforts along with a scale-up of ZIKV whole-genome sequencing provide an opportunity to understand the patterns of genetic diversity, evolution, and spread of ZIKV. However, a classification system that reflects the true extent of ZIKV genetic variation is lacking. Our objective was to characterize ZIKV genetic diversity and phylodynamics, identify genomic footprints of differentiation patterns, and propose a dynamic classification system that reflects its divergence levels. We analysed a curated dataset of 762 publicly available sequences spanning the full-length coding region of ZIKV from across its geographical span and collected between 1947 and 2021. The definition of genetic groups was based on comprehensive evolutionary dynamics analyses, which included recombination and phylogenetic analyses, within- and between-group pairwise genetic distances comparison, detection of selective pressure, and clustering analyses. Evidence for potential recombination events was detected in a few sequences. However, we argue that these events are likely due to sequencing errors as proposed in previous studies. There was evidence of strong purifying selection, widespread across the genome, as also detected for other arboviruses. A total of 50 sites showed evidence of positive selection, and for a few of these sites, there was amino acid (AA) differentiation between genetic clusters. Two main genetic clusters were defined, ZA and ZB, which correspond to the already characterized 'African' and 'Asian' genotypes, respectively. Within ZB, two subgroups, ZB.1 and ZB.2, represent the Asiatic and the American (and Oceania) lineages, respectively. ZB.1 is further subdivided into ZB.1.0 (a basal Malaysia sequence sampled in the 1960s and a recent Indian sequence), ZB.1.1 (South-Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, and Micronesia sequences), and ZB.1.2 (very similar sequences from the outbreak in Singapore). ZB.2 is subdivided into ZB.2.0 (basal American sequences and the sequences from French Polynesia, the putative origin of South America introduction), ZB.2.1 (Central America), and ZB.2.2 (Caribbean and North America). This classification system does not use geographical references and is flexible to accommodate potential future lineages. It will be a helpful tool for studies that involve analyses of ZIKV genomic variation and its association with pathogenicity and serve as a starting point for the public health surveillance and response to on-going and future epidemics and to outbreaks that lead to the emergence of new variants.",Genome-wide diversity of Zika virus: Exploring spatio-temporal dynamics to guide a new nomenclature proposal,"Seabra, S.G., Libin, P.J.K., Theys, K., Zhukova, A., Potter, B.I., Nebenzahl-Guimaraes, H., Gorbalenya, A.E., Sidorov, I.A., Pimentel, V., Pingarilho, M., de Vasconcelos, A.T.R., Dellicour, S., Khouri, R., Gascuel, O., Vandamme, A.M., Baele, G., Cuypers, L., Abecasis, A.B.",2022,VIRUS EVOLUTION,8,1,veac029,,,15,1,10.1093/ve/veac029,,"[Seabra, Sofia G.; Nebenzahl-Guimaraes, Hanna; Pimentel, Victor; Pingarilho, Marta; Abecasis, Ana B.] Univ Nova Lisboa UNL, Inst Higiene & Med Trop IHMT, Global Hlth & Trop Med GHTM, Rua Junqueira 100, P-1349008 Lisbon, Portugal; [Libin, Pieter J.

"Using DATASUS, Brazil's national healthcare database, data were collected on the total amount of performed bellwether procedures-cesarean section, laparotomy, and open fracture management-and their associated mortality, by geographical region",Yes,"Background Brazil is a middle-income country that aims to provide universal health coverage, but its surgical system's efficiency has rarely been analyzed. In an effort to strengthen surgical national systems, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery proposed bellwether procedures as quality indicators of surgical workforces. This study aims to evaluate regional inequalities in access to bellwether procedures and their associated mortality across the five Brazilian geographical regions.Methods Using DATASUS, Brazil's national healthcare database, data were collected on the total amount of performed bellwether procedures-cesarean section, laparotomy, and open fracture management-and their associated mortality, by geographical region. We evaluated the years 2018-2020, both in emergent and elective conditions. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA test and Tukey's multiple comparisons test.Results During this period, DATASUS registered 2,687,179 cesarean sections, 1,036,841 laparotomies, and 648,961 open fracture treatments. The access and associated mortality related to these procedures were homogeneous between the regions in elective care. There were significant geographical inequalities in access and associated mortality in emergency care (p < 0.05, 95% CI) for all bellwether procedures. The Southeast, the most economically developed region of the country, was the region with the lowest amount of bellwether procedures per 100,000 inhabitants.Conclusion Brazil's public surgical system is competent at promoting elective surgical care, but more effort is needed to fortify emergency care services.

Methods Descriptive serial cross-sectional study based on secondary data on COVID-19 hospitalizations from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records collected by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and COVID-19 case notification data from Brasil.io, a repository of public data. Fifty-six epidemiological weeks were split into four periods. The following variables were considered for each Brazilian Health Region, per period: number of hospitalizations, hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants, hospitalizations per 100 new cases notified in the Health Region, percentage of hospitalizations with ICU use, percentages of hospitalizations with invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support, percentage of hospitalizations resulting in death and percentage of hospitalizations with ICU use resulting in death. Descriptive statistics of the variables were obtained across all 450 Health Regions in Brazil over the four defined pandemic periods. Maps were generated to capture the spatiotemporal variation and trends during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Results There was great variation in how COVID-19 hospitalizations grew and spread among Health Regions, with higher numbers between June and August 2020, and, especially, from mid-December 2020 to March 2021. The variation pattern in the proportion of ICU use in the hospitalizations across the Health Regions was broad, with no intensive care provision in large areas in the North, Northeast, and Midwest. The proportions of hospitalizations and hospitalizations with ICU use resulting in deaths were remarkably high, reaching medians of 34.0% and 62.0% across Health Regions, respectively. Conclusion The Heath Regions in Brazil are highly diverse, showing broad disparities in the capacity to respond to the demands imposed by COVID-19, services provided, use and outcomes.","Geographical variation in demand, utilization, and outcomes of hospital services for COVID-19 in Brazil: A descriptive serial cross-sectional study","Pereira, C.C.D., Martins, M., Lima, S.M.L., de Andrade, C.L.T., Soares, F.R.G., Portela, M.C.",2021,PLOS ONE,16,9,e0257643,,,13,5,10.1371/journal.pone.0257643,,"[de Aguiar Pereira, Claudia Cristina; Martins, Monica; Lima, Sheyla Maria Lemos; Tavares de Andrade, Carla Lourenco; Gameleira Soares, Fernando Ramalho; Portela, Margareth Crisostomo] Oswaldo Cruz Fdn Fiocruz, Sergio Arouca Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Gameleira Soares, Fernando Ramalho] Brazilian Inst Geog & Stat IBGE, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,,MORTALITY,MORTALITY,mportela@ensp.fiocruz.br,,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",,,,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,1932-6203,,,34591896,English,PLOS ONE,Article,WoS,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000743903000021,,Brazil,ensp.fiocruz.br,Oswaldo Cruz Fdn Fiocruz;Brazilian Inst Geog & Stat IBGE,"Oswaldo Cruz Fdn Fiocruz, Brazil;Brazilian Inst Geog & Stat IBGE, Brazil","de Aguiar Pereira, Claudia Cristina; Martins, Monica; Lima, Sheyla Maria Lemos; Tavares de Andrade, Carla Lourenco; Gameleira Soares, Fernando Ramalho; Portela, Margareth Crisostomo",,
This is about a course,No,"Aims and objectives To assess formative and summative milestones in a digital course and the reach to low- and middle-income countries of a Massive Open Online Course focussing on supporting nurses dealing with an emerging pandemic. Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has ravaged the globe and increased the need for timely and accurate information from reliable sources. Access to reliable and accurate information, as well as support, is important in achieving health systems strengthening. Using a Massive Open Online Course format, an educational resource aimed at large-scale interactive participation via the Internet, and participants were engaged in a course focussing on nursing in a time of crisis and involved using social learning principles. Design Observational descriptive study. Method Routinely collected data were collated during the period of 18 May-18 July 2020 focused on both formative and summative milestones in the course. Data were separated and classified by income in accordance with the publicly accessible 2020 World Bank Open Dataset. Results During the 2-month period of observation (18 May-18 July 2020), 10,130 individuals from 156 countries enrolled in the course. More than 51% of participants were Active Learners.

"We examine a freely available, open data source for this use: access logs from the online encyclopedia Wikipedia.",Yes,"Infectious disease is a leading threat to public health, economic stability, and other key social structures. Efforts to mitigate these impacts depend on accurate and timely monitoring to measure the risk and progress of disease. Traditional, biologically-focused monitoring techniques are accurate but costly and slow; in response, new techniques based on social internet data, such as social media and search queries, are emerging. These efforts are promising, but important challenges in the areas of scientific peer review, breadth of diseases and countries, and forecasting hamper their operational usefulness. We examine a freely available, open data source for this use: access logs from the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Using linear models, language as a proxy for location, and a systematic yet simple article selection procedure, we tested 14 location-disease combinations and demonstrate that these data feasibly support an approach that overcomes these challenges. Specifically, our proof-of-concept yields models with (Formula presented.) up to 0.92, forecasting value up to the 28 days tested, and several pairs of models similar enough to suggest that transferring models from one location to another without re-training is feasible. Based on these preliminary results, we close with a research agenda designed to overcome these challenges and produce a disease monitoring and forecasting system that is significantly more effective, robust, and globally comprehensive than the current state of the art. © 2014.",Global Disease Monitoring and Forecasting with Wikipedia,"Generous N., Fairchild G., Deshpande A., Del Valle S.Y., Priedhorsky R.",2014,PLoS Computational Biology,10,11,,,,16,128,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003892,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84912131759&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pcbi.1003892&partnerID=40&md5=cf17b93e43368a7899c36c955ed40e16,"Defense Systems and Analysis Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, United States","Generous, N., Defense Systems and Analysis Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, United States; Fairchild, G., Defense Systems and Analysis Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, United States; Deshpande, A., Defense Systems and Analysis Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, United States; Del Valle, S.Y., Defense Systems and Analysis Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, United States; Priedhorsky, R., Defense Systems and Analysis Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, United States",,"Forecasting; Health risks; Monitoring; Risk assessment; Disease forecasting; Disease monitoring; Economic stability; Focused monitoring; Health economics; Infectious disease; Internet data; Monitoring techniques; Social structure; Wikipedia; Location; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Article; Brazil; dengue; disease surveillance; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; forecasting; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; incidence; influenza; information processing; information retrieval; Internet; Japan; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; online system; simulation; social media; Thailand; tuberculosis; United States; web browser; wikipedia; Communicable Diseases; environmental monitoring; epidemic; factual database; forecasting; health; Internet; procedures; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; Communicable Diseases; Databases, Factual; Disease Outbreaks; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Global Health; Humans; Internet; Models, Theoretical","Forecasting;Health risks;Monitoring;Risk assessment;Disease forecasting;Disease monitoring;Economic stability;Focused monitoring;Health economics;Infectious disease;Internet data;Monitoring techniques;Social structure;Wikipedia;Location;acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Article;Brazil;dengue;disease surveillance;Ebola hemorrhagic fever;human;Human immunodeficiency virus;incidence;influenza;information processing;information retrieval;Internet;Japan;methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus;online system;simulation;social media;Thailand;tuberculosis;United States;web browser;Communicable Diseases;environmental monitoring;epidemic;factual database;health;procedures;statistics and numerical data;theoretical model;Databases, Factual;Disease Outbreaks;Global Health;Humans;Models, Theoretical","Generous, N.; Defense Systems and Analysis Division, United States",,,,,,Public Library of Science,1553734X,,,25392913,English,PLoS Comput.

This is about a course,No,"Background: At the onset of the coronavirus outbreak, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Emergencies Learning and Capacity Development Unit, together with the WHO's health technical lead on coronaviruses, developed a massive open online course within 3 weeks as part of the global response to the emergency. The introductory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) course was launched on January 26, 2020, on the health emergencies learning platform OpenWHO.org. Objective: The aim of this paper is to investigate the geographic reach of different language courses accessed by a worldwide audience seeking information on COVID-19. Users' professional identities and backgrounds were explored to inform course owners on the use case. The course was developed and delivered via the open-access learning platform OpenWHO.org. The self-paced resources are available in a total of 13 languages and were produced between January 26 and March 25, 2020. Methods: Data were collected from the online courses' statistical data and metrics reporting system on the OpenWHO platform. User patterns and locations were analyzed based on Google Analytics and the platform's own statistics capabilities, and data sets were overlaid. This analysis was conducted based on user location, with the data disaggregated according to the six WHO regions, the top 10 countries, and the proportion of use for each language version. Data included affiliation, gender, age, and other parameters for 32.43% (52,214/161,007) of the users who indicated their background. Results: As of March 25, 2020, the introductory COVID-19 course totaled 232,890 enrollments across all languages. The Spanish language course was comprised of more than half (n=118,754, 50.99%) of all course enrollments, and the English language course was comprised of 38.21% (n=88,988) of enrollments. The WHO's Region of the Americas accounted for most of the course enrollments, with more than 72.47% (138,503/191,130) enrollment across all languages. Other regions were more evenly distributed with less than 10% enrollment for each. A total of 32.43% (52,214/161,007) of users specified a professional affiliation by choosing from the 12 most common backgrounds in the OpenWHO user profiles. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, users were spread over the 11 distinct affiliations, with a small fraction of users identifying themselves as ""Other."" With the COVID-19 introductory course, the largest number of users selected ""Other"" (16,527/52,214, 31.65%), suggesting a large number of users who were not health professionals or academics. The top 10 countries with the most users across all languages were Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Mexico, Peru, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Conclusions: The online course has addressed a worldwide learning need by providing WHO's technical guidance packaged in simple formats for access and use. The learning material development was expedited to meet the onset of the epidemic.

Review,No,"Background Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. Findings The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72.3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71.2-73.2) of deaths in 2016 with 19.3% (18.5-20.4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8.43% (8.00-8.67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16-age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1.80 million deaths (95% UI 1.59 million to 1.89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2.89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1.59%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. Interpretation The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

This ia a framework to create a db,No,"Background: The ability to apply standard and interoperable solutions for implementing and managing medical registries as well as aggregate, reproduce, and access data sets from legacy formats and platforms to advanced standard formats and operating systems are crucial for both clinical healthcare and biomedical research settings. Purpose: Our study describes a reproducible, highly scalable, standard framework for a device registry implementation addressing both local data quality components and global linking problems. Methods and Results: We developed a device registry framework involving the following steps: (1) Data standards definition and representation of the research workflow, (2) Development of electronic case report forms using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), (3) Data collection according to the clinical research workflow and, (4) Data augmentation by enriching the registry database with local electronic health records, governmental database and linked open data collections, (5) Data quality control and (6) Data dissemination through the registry Web site. Our registry adopted all applicable standardized data elements proposed by American College Cardiology/American Heart Association Clinical Data Standards, as well as variables derived from cardiac devices randomized trials and Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium. Local interoperability was performed between REDCap and data derived from Electronic Health Record system. The original data set was also augmented by incorporating the reimbursed values paid by the Brazilian government during a hospitalization for pacemaker implantation. By linking our registry to the open data collection repository Linked Clinical Trials (LinkedCT) we found 130 clinical trials which are potentially correlated with our pacemaker registry. Conclusion: This study demonstrates how standard and reproducible solutions can be applied in the implementation of medical registries to constitute a re-usable framework. Such approach has the potential to facilitate data integration between healthcare and research settings, also being a useful framework to be used in other biomedical registries.",Glocal Clinical Registries: Pacemaker Registry Design and Implementation for Global and Local Integration - Methodology and Case Study,"da Silva, K.R., Costa, R., Crevelari, E.S., Lacerda, M.S., Albertini, C.M.D., Martinelli, M., Santana, J.E., Vissoci, J.R.N., Pietrobon, R., Barros, J.V.",2013,PLOS ONE,8,7,e71090,,,12,20,10.1371/journal.pone.0071090,,"[da Silva, Katia Regina; Crevelari, Elizabeth Sartori; Lacerda, Marianna Sobral; de Moraes Albertini, Caio Marcos] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Med, Clin Hosp, Heart Inst InCor, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [da Silva, Katia Regina; Pietrobon, Ricardo] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Costa, Roberto] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Med, Clin Hosp, Heart Inst InCor,Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Martinelli Filho, Martino] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Med, Clin Hosp, Heart Inst InCor,Dept Cardiol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Nickenig Vissoci, Joao Ricardo] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Nickenig Vissoci, Joao Ricardo] Pontific Catholic Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Nickenig Vissoci, Joao Ricardo] Fac Inga, Dept Med, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Barros, Jacson V.] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Med, Clin Hosp, Sao Paulo, Brazil",,,ASSOCIATION TASK-FORCE; KEY DATA ELEMENTS; CARDIAC-RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY; STANDARDS WRITING COMMITTEE; ELECTRONIC DATA CAPTURE; DEVELOP DATA STANDARDS; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; DEFINITIONS; HEALTH; DEFIBRILLATOR,ASSOCIATION TASK-FORCE;KEY DATA ELEMENTS;CARDIAC-RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY;STANDARDS WRITING COMMITTEE;ELECTRONIC DATA CAPTURE;DEVELOP DATA STANDARDS;AMERICAN-COLLEGE;DEFINITIONS;HEALTH;DEFIBRILLATOR,katia.regina@incor.usp.br,,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",,,,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,1932-6203,,,23936257,English,PLOS ONE,Article,WoS,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000322433300117,2-s2.0-84880816375,Brazil;United States,incor.usp.br,Univ Sao Paulo;Duke Univ;Pontific Catholic Univ Sao Paulo;Fac Inga,"Univ Sao Paulo, Brazil;Duke Univ, United States;Pontific Catholic Univ Sao Paulo, Brazil;Fac Inga, Brazil","da Silva, Katia Regina; Costa, Roberto; Crevelari, Elizabeth Sartori; Lacerda, Marianna Sobral; de Moraes Albertini, Caio Marcos; Martinelli Filho, Martino; Santana, Jose Eduardo; Nickenig Vissoci, Joao Ricardo; Pietrobon, Ricardo; Barros, Jacson V.",,
we accessed annual AIDS incidence series and state-level socio-demographic variables from publicly available databases,Yes,"The early dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak can be affected by various factors including the transmission mode of the disease and host-specific factors. While recent works have highlighted the presence of sub-exponential growth patterns during the early phase of epidemics, empirical studies examining the contribution of different factors to early epidemic growth dynamics are lacking. Here we aim to characterize and explain the early incidence growth patterns of local HIV/AIDS epidemics in Brazil as a function of socio-demographic factors. For this purpose, we accessed annual AIDS incidence series and state-level socio-demographic variables from publicly available databases. To characterize the early growth dynamics of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we employed the generalized-growth model to estimate with quantified uncertainty the scaling of growth parameter (p) which captures growth patterns ranging from constant incidence (p=0) to sub-exponential (0 < p < 1) and exponential growth dynamics (p=1) at three spatial scales: national, regional, and state levels. We evaluated the relationship between socio-demographic variables and epidemic growth patterns across 27 Brazilian states using mixed-effect regression analyses. We found wide variation in the early dynamics of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil, displaying sub-exponential growth patterns with the p parameter estimated substantially below 1.0. The mean p was estimated to be 0.81 at the national level, with a range of 0.72–0.85 at the regional level, and a range of 0.28–0.96 at the state level. Our findings support the notion that socio-demographic factors contribute to shaping the early growth dynamics of the epidemic at the local level. Gini index and socio-demographic index were negatively associated with the parameter p, whereas urbanicity was positively associated with p. The results could have theoretical significance in understanding differences in growth scaling across different sexually transmitted disease systems, and have public health implications to guide control. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Growth scaling for the early dynamics of HIV/AIDS epidemics in Brazil and the influence of socio-demographic factors,"Dinh L., Chowell G., Rothenberg R.",2018,Journal of Theoretical Biology,442,,,79,86,,10,10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.12.030,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041481342&doi=10.1016%2fj.jtbi.2017.12.030&partnerID=40&md5=1bdc3f7897ce1c7c42eb4f4c245975a1,"Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, United States; Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States","Dinh, L., Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, United States; Chowell, G., Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, United States, Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States; Rothenberg, R., Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, United States",Brazil; Demographic factors; HIV/AIDS epidemic; Sub-exponential growth,"acquired immune deficiency syndrome; demographic survey; epidemiology; growth modeling; human immunodeficiency virus; public health; regression analysis; sexually transmitted disease; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Article; Brazil; Brazilian; controlled study; demography; generalized growth model; Gini index; human; incidence; mathematical model; mathematical parameters; mixed effect regression analysis; population density; priority journal; regression analysis; socio demographic index; urbanicity; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; algorithm; epidemic; factual database; geography; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; incidence; physiology; socioeconomics; theoretical model; transmission; virology; Brazil; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Algorithms; Brazil; Databases, Factual; Epidemics; Geography; HIV; HIV Infections; Humans; Incidence; Models, Theoretical; Socioeconomic Factors","Brazil;Demographic factors;HIV/AIDS epidemic;Sub-exponential growth;acquired immune deficiency syndrome;demographic survey;epidemiology;growth modeling;human immunodeficiency virus;public health;regression analysis;sexually transmitted disease;Article;Brazilian;controlled study;demography;generalized growth model;Gini index;human;incidence;mathematical model;mathematical parameters;mixed effect regression analysis;population density;priority journal;socio demographic index;urbanicity;algorithm;epidemic;factual database;geography;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;physiology;socioeconomics;theoretical model;transmission;virology;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Algorithms;Databases, Factual;Epidemics;HIV;HIV Infections;Humans;Models, Theoretical;Socioeconomic Factors","Dinh, L.; Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, United States; email: ldinh4@student.gsu.edu",,,,,,Academic Press,225193,,JTBIA,29330056,English,J.

socioeconomic and clinical epidemiological variables obtained from the Information System of Notifiable Diseases of Hanseniasis (SINAN) database,Yes,"Background: Hanseniasis is a public health concern in developing countries. Although a decrease in the number of new cases in Brazil has been reported, there is a prevalence above that recommended in some regions. Aims: Considering the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to accelerate towards a leprosy-free world from 2020, the aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological profile and leprosy trends in the city of Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the epidemiology and trends of hanseniasis between 2005 and 2018, monitoring socioeconomic and clinical epidemiological variables obtained from the Information System of Notifiable Diseases of Hanseniasis (SINAN) database. Results: A total of 422 cases of hanseniasis (284 male, 138 female) were included. The questionnaire of six patients was incomplete. The highest number of cases (89) was recorded in 2006 (11.7/10,000 inhabitants). The borderline clinical form was most common, with 45.4% of cases. Throughout the historical series, the rate of annual percentage change in the detection of new cases and cases with grade 2 disability showed a decreasing profile, at -13.9 [95% CI: -19.1, -8.2] and -13.1 [95% CI: -21.8, -5.5], respectively. The same rates were observed in patients below 15 years of age. Limitations: This study reflects the scenario in one reference center and data were obtained retrospectively. Conclusions: The incidence of hanseniasis in this reference center is declining gradually; however, the indicators show active disease transmission and late diagnosis.

Review,No,"Although based on a growing market and popular means of leisure and communication, serious games for health in Brazil still depend highly on public funding and mostly on individual initiatives from researchers and developers. This paper proposes the consolidation of Games and Health as a field of work and research, discussing its origins and developments in Brazil, the challenges yet to tackle and the strategies proposed by health games researchers and developers for that end. The development of serious games for health in Brazil has originated in distinct areas, such as Computation, Education and Design and Arts and followed different paths. Exergames, games as therapy and games for health communication and participation are the main directions pursued nowadays. The main challenges are the achievement of funding to develop projects; the lack of records about the games and tests produced; the insufficient testing still shown by the researches published; the lack of common vocabulary among researchers and developers across the country and the medicalization that still informs the production of many games for health, reducing the scope of what could be achieved on the field. As strategies, this work proposes the production of three open and collaborative initiatives: a common vocabulary; a guide with best practices in Health Game Research and Development; an open database of finished and ongoing projects, in order to facilitate partnerships. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Health Games in Brazil,"Vasconcellos M., Dias C., Carvalho F., Braga R., Xavier G.",2019,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11582 LNCS,,,457,472,,0,10.1007/978-3-030-22219-2_34,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069819520&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-22219-2_34&partnerID=40&md5=04551b80419304ccc3adf812d8d03137,"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Pontifical Catholic University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil; Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Vasconcellos, M., Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Dias, C., Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Carvalho, F., Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Braga, R., Pontifical Catholic University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil; Xavier, G., Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",Exergames; Games and health; Health communication and games; Health games; Public health; Serious games for health,Ergonomics; Health; Health risks; Human computer interaction; Public health; Risk management; Safety engineering; Best practices; Exergames; Growing markets; Health communication; Health games; Public funding; Serious games for healths; Serious games,Exergames;Games and health;Health communication and games;Health games;Public health;Serious games for health;Ergonomics;Health;Health risks;Human computer interaction;Risk management;Safety engineering;Best practices;Growing markets;Health communication;Public funding;Serious games for healths;Serious games,"Dias, C.; Oswaldo Cruz FoundationBrazil; email: cymadi@gmail.com",Duffy V.G.,,"10th International Conference on Digital Human Modeling and Applications in Health, Safety, Ergonomics and Risk Management, DHM 2019, held as part of the 21st International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCI International 2019",,26 July 2019 through 31 July 2019,Springer Verlag,3029743,9783030222185,,,English,Lect.

They created an open db,Yes,"The Latin America and the Caribbean region is one of the most urbanized regions in the world, with a total population of around 630 million that is expected to increase by 25% by 2050. In this context, detailed and contemporary datasets accurately describing the distribution of residential population in the region are required for measuring the impacts of population growth, monitoring changes, supporting environmental and health applications, and planning interventions. To support these needs, an open access archive of high-resolution gridded population datasets was created through disaggregation of the most recent official population count data available for 28 countries located in the region. These datasets are described here along with the approach and methods used to create and validate them. For each country, population distribution datasets, having a resolution of 3 arc seconds (approximately 100 m at the equator), were produced for the population count year, as well as for 2010, 2015, and 2020.

downloaded sets of live births and mothers’ data alongside HIV-1 cases notification in children one year old or less,Yes,"HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission (HIV-1 MTCT), is an important cause of children mortality worldwide. Brazil has been traditionally praised by its HIV/Aids program, which provides free-of-charge care for people living with HIV-1. Using public epidemiology and demographic databases, we aimed at modeling HIV-1 MTCT prevalence in Brazil through the years (1994–2016) and elaborate a statistical model for forecasting, contributing to HIV-1 epidemiologic surveillance and healthcare decision-making. We downloaded sets of live births and mothers’ data alongside HIV-1 cases notification in children one year old or less. Through time series modeling, we estimated prevalence along the years in Brazil, and observed a remarkable decrease of HIV-1 MTCT between 1994 (10 cases per 100,000 live births) and 2016 (five cases per 100,000 live births), a reduction of 50%. Using our model, we elaborated a prognosis for each Brazilian state to help HIV-1 surveillance decision making, indicating which states are in theory in risk of experiencing a rise in HIV-1 MTCT prevalence. Ten states had good (37%), nine had mild (33%), and eight had poor prognostics (30%). Stratifying the prognostics by Brazilian region, we observed that the Northeast region had more states with poor prognosis, followed by North and Midwest, Southeast and South with one state of poor prognosis each. Brazil undoubtedly advanced in the fight against HIV-1 MTCT in the past two decades. We hope our model will help indicating where HIV-1 MTCT prevalence may rise in the future and support government decision makers regarding HIV-1 surveillance and prevention. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia",HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission in Brazil (1994–2016): a time series modeling,"Campos Coelho A.V., Campos Coelho H.F., Arraes L.C., Crovella S.",2019,Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases,23,4,,218,223,,5,10.1016/j.bjid.2019.06.012,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070410264&doi=10.1016%2fj.bjid.2019.06.012&partnerID=40&md5=682a0f77e62a7d8edad2e4af168958da,"Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Departamento de Biologia Molecular, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Departamento de Genética, Recife, PE, Brazil; Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Departamento de Estatística, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Departamento de Medicina Tropical, Recife, PE, Brazil; Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira, Recife, PE, Brazil","Campos Coelho, A.V., Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Departamento de Biologia Molecular, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Departamento de Genética, Recife, PE, Brazil; Campos Coelho, H.F., Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Departamento de Estatística, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil; Arraes, L.C., Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Departamento de Medicina Tropical, Recife, PE, Brazil, Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira, Recife, PE, Brazil; Crovella, S., Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Departamento de Genética, Recife, PE, Brazil",Biostatistics; Epidemiology; Forecasting; HIV-1; Perinatal transmission; Vertical transmission,"article; biostatistics; Brazil; child; clinical article; controlled study; decision making; female; forecasting; government; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; infant; live birth; mother; nonhuman; prevalence; prognosis; theoretical study; time series analysis; vertical transmission; adolescent; adult; Brazil; forecasting; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; middle aged; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; statistical model; time factor; vertical transmission; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Brazil; Child; Female; Forecasting; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Linear Models; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Prevalence; Time Factors; Young Adult","Biostatistics;Epidemiology;Forecasting;HIV-1;Perinatal transmission;Vertical transmission;article;Brazil;child;clinical article;controlled study;decision making;female;government;human;Human immunodeficiency virus 1;infant;live birth;mother;nonhuman;prevalence;prognosis;theoretical study;time series analysis;adolescent;adult;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;middle aged;pregnancy;pregnancy complication;statistical model;time factor;young adult;HIV Infections;Humans;Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical;Linear Models;Pregnancy Complications, Infectious;Time Factors","Campos Coelho, A.V.; Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Brazil; email: antoniocampos@dbm.ufpb.br",,,,,,Elsevier Editora Ltda,14138670,,BJIDA,31344355,English,Braz.

"We obtained regional-and national-level incidence data from 48 population-based cancer registries in 13 countries, and national-level mortality data from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries",Yes,"Rationale and objective: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is largely curable owing to improvements in treatment since the 1960s; nevertheless, high mortality rates have been reported in Central and South America. We describe the current burden of HL in the Central and South American region. Methods: We obtained regional-and national-level incidence data from 48 population-based cancer registries in 13 countries, and national-level mortality data from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries. We estimated world population age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) and agestandardized mortality rates (ASMRs) per 100,000 person-years for 2003-2007 and present distributions by histological subtype. Results: HL incidence rates varied 7-fold in males and 11-fold in females (male-to-female ratio 1: 1-2.5: 1). The highest ASRs were seen Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica (males), Cuba (males) and Uruguay (females), whereas the lowest were in Bolivia and El Salvador. ASMRs varied by 4-fold in males and 6-fold in females (male-to-female ratio 1: 1-4.3: 1), with ASMRs < 0.7 for most countries, except Cuba (>= 1.0). In most countries, age-specific incidence rates of HL showed a bimodal pattern. Trends in HL in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Costa Rica remained stable in 1997-2008. Of all HL cases, 48% were unspecified as to histological subtype. Nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity were the most frequent histologies. Conclusion: The geographic variation in HL across the region may in part reflect differences in data quality and coverage, and differences in the adoption of modern therapies and healthcare access. Our results highlight the need for high-quality data and increased coverage in order to provide vital guidance for future cancer control activities.

They are using hospital data mostly,No,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented pressure over health care systems worldwide. Hospital-level data that may influence the prognosis in COVID-19 patients still needs to be better investigated. Therefore, this study analyzed regional socioeconomic, hospital, and intensive care units (ICU) characteristics associated with in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients admitted to Brazilian institutions. This multicenter retrospective cohort study is part of the Brazilian COVID-19 Registry. We enrolled patients ≥ 18 years old with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the participating hospitals from March to September 2020. Patients’ data were obtained through hospital records. Hospitals’ data were collected through forms filled in loco and through open national databases. Generalized linear mixed models with logit link function were used for pooling mortality and to assess the association between hospital characteristics and mortality estimates. We built two models, one tested general hospital characteristics while the other tested ICU characteristics. All analyses were adjusted for the proportion of high-risk patients at admission. Thirty-one hospitals were included. The mean number of beds was 320.4 ± 186.6. These hospitals had eligible 6556 COVID-19 admissions during the study period. Estimated in-hospital mortality ranged from 9.0 to 48.0%. The first model included all 31 hospitals and showed that a private source of funding (β = − 0.37; 95% CI − 0.71 to − 0.04; p = 0.029) and location in areas with a high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (β = − 0.40; 95% CI − 0.72 to − 0.08; p = 0.014) were independently associated with a lower mortality. The second model included 23 hospitals and showed that hospitals with an ICU work shift composed of more than 50% of intensivists (β = − 0.59; 95% CI − 0.98 to − 0.20; p = 0.003) had lower mortality while hospitals with a higher proportion of less experienced medical professionals had higher mortality (β = 0.40; 95% CI 0.11–0.68; p = 0.006). The impact of those association increased according to the proportion of high-risk patients at admission. In-hospital mortality varied significantly among Brazilian hospitals. Private-funded hospitals and those located in municipalities with a high GDP had a lower mortality. When analyzing ICU-specific characteristics, hospitals with more experienced ICU teams had a reduced mortality. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Società Italiana di Medicina Interna (SIMI).",Hospital characteristics associated with COVID-19 mortality: data from the multicenter cohort Brazilian Registry,"Souza-Silva M.V.R., Ziegelmann P.K., Nobre V., Gomes V.M.R., Etges A.P.B.S., Schwarzbold A.V., Nunes A.G.S., Maurilio A.O., Scotton A.L.B.A., Costa A.S.M., Glaeser A.B., Farace B.L., Ribeiro B.N., Ramos C.M., Cimini C.C.R., de Carvalho C.A., Rempel C., Silveira D.V., Carazai D.R., Ponce D., Pereira E.C., Kroger E.M.S., Manenti E.R.F., Cenci E.P.A., Lucas F.B., dos Santos F.C., Anschau F., Botoni F.A., Aranha F.G., de Aguiar F.C., Bartolazzi F., Crestani G.P., Vietta G.G., Nascimento G.F., Noal H.C., Duani H., Vianna H.R., Guimaraes H.C., de Alvarenga J.C., Chatkin J.M., de Morais J.D.P., Carvalho J.S.N., Rugolo J.M., Ruschel K.B., Gomes L.B.W., de Oliveira L.S., Zandona L.B., Pinheiro L.S., Pacheco L.S., Menezes L.S.M., Sousa L.D., de Moura L.C.S., Santos L.E.A., Nasi L.A., Cabral M.A.S., Floriani M.A., Souza M.D., Carneiro M., de Godoy M.F., Cardoso M.M.A., Nogueira M.C.A., Lima M.O.S.S., de Figueiredo M.P., Guimaraes-Junior M.H., Sampaio N.C.S., de Oliveira N.R., Andrade P.G.S., Assaf P.L., Martelli P.J.L., Martins R.C., Valacio R.A., Pozza R., Menezes R.M., Mourato R.L.S., de Abreu R.M., Silva R.F., Francisco S.C., Guimaraes S.M.M., Araujo S.F., Oliveira T.F., Kurtz T., Fereguetti T.O., de Oliveira T.C., Ribeiro Y.C.N.M.B., Ramires Y.C., Polanczyk C.A., Marcolino M.S.",2022,Internal and Emergency Medicine,17,8,,2299,2313,,1,10.1007/s11739-022-03092-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138698697&doi=10.1007%2fs11739-022-03092-9&partnerID=40&md5=5ad3bbf0692b94a6f5716fc23fc6fd65,"Medical School and University Hospital, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Avenida Professor Alfredo Balena, 190, sala 246, Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil;

Review,No,"The hospital area is constantly in need of care and attention. Because of its urgencies, it has vulnerabilities and risks that hinder the quality of hospital management. Technological management tools are effective in improving processes and strategic administration because they provide information reliability. The aim of this work is to propose to the Brazilian Federal University Hospitals (FUH's) the use of an open source Business Intelligence (BI) tool, Pentaho, to analyze the Hospital Occupancy Rate (HOR) and support clinical decision making. This paper describes BI and Pentaho, as well as the main points of the E-EFI-01 efficiency documentation established by the National Agency of Supplementary Health (NASH), with emphasis on the hospital indicator Occupancy Rate. Through Pentaho, is made the data extraction and the transformation, as well as loading them into the Data Warehouse (DW), all based on a relational database of the Brazilian Hospital Services Company (BHSC). After that, dimensional cubes are created for the generation of graphic panels in dashboards. It can be seen that most BHSC hospitals are not yet adequately using their operational beds, being outside the goal established by NASH. Several steps are taken to achieve efficient hospital administration, but the joint working of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions with the health area and its standards, provides a major step towards efficient hospital management.",Hospital occupation rate analysis of the Brazilian Federal University Hospitals through Business Intelligence,"Noce, C.A.M., Nze, G.D.A., Brasil, L.M.",2017,2017 12TH IBERIAN CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES (CISTI),,,,,,6,0,,,"[Melo Noce, Carlo Alessandro; Amvame Nze, Georges Daniel; Brasil, Lourdes Mattos] Univ Brasilia UnB, Fac Gama FGA, FT, Programa Posgrad Engn Biomed PPGEB, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",,ICT; hospital management; BI; BHSC; hospital indicators,,ICT;hospital management;BI;BHSC;hospital indicators,alessandro_mn@hotmail.com; georges.amvame@gmail.com; lmbrasil@gmail.com,,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",12th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI),"Lisbon, PORTUGAL","JUN 21-24, 2017",IEEE,2166-0727,,,,Portuguese,IBER CONF INF SYST,Proceedings Paper,WoS,Computer Science,WOS:000426896900211,2-s2.0-85027229012,Brazil,hotmail.com,Univ Brasilia UnB,"Univ Brasilia UnB, Brazil","Melo Noce, Carlo Alessandro; Amvame Nze, Georges Daniel; Brasil, Lourdes Mattos",,
This is mainly in US,No,"Objectives Food marketing to children is pervasive and linked to increased preference and intake of unhealthy foods. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the only multi-country nutrient criteria, and Chile recently released the world's most comprehensive regulation to identify foods that should not be marketed to children. Our objective was to examine the proportion of US packaged food and beverage products eligible for marketing to children under the WHO Europe Nutrient Profile Model (NPM) and the 2019 Chilean regulation. MethodsData for this study are from Label Insight's 2017 Open Access branded food database. Each product was assigned to one of 13 food categories, and nutritional content compared to both the NPM and Chilean criteria. The proportion of US products meeting criteria for marketing to children using both schemes was examined overall and by category. Agreement between the two criteria was examined using Cohen's Kappa. Results Of 17,740 US products, 21% were eligible to be marketed to children using the WHO criteria and 26% using the Chilean criteria. 'Egg and egg products' and 'Seafood' had the highest proportion of products eligible for marketing to children under both schemes.'Confectionery' and 'Snack foods' had the lowest proportion eligible. Conclusions for practice The WHO NPM and Chilean criteria both restrict less healthy items from being marketed to children. Regulatory agencies in the US developing policies should consider the implementation of nutrient criteria to restrict the marketing of less healthy foods and beverages to children and adolescents.",How Does the Healthfulness of the US Food Supply Compare to International Guidelines for Marketing to Children and Adolescents?,"Dunford, E.K., Ng, S.W., Taillie, L.S.",2019,MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL,23,6,,768,776,9,0,10.1007/s10995-018-02693-1,,"[Dunford, Elizabeth K.] George Inst Global Hlth, Food Policy Div, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dunford, Elizabeth K.; Ng, Shu Wen; Taillie, Lindsey Smith] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Ng, Shu Wen; Taillie, Lindsey Smith] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Nutr, Chapel Hill, NC USA",,Food marketing; Processed foods; Public health nutrition; Nutrient profiling,,Food marketing;Processed foods;Public health nutrition;Nutrient profiling,edunford@georgeinstitute.org.au; shuwen@unc.edu; smithlp@email.unc.edu,,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",,,,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,1092-7875,,,30569302,English,MATERN CHILD HLTH J,Article,WoS,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",WOS:000467623600007,2-s2.0-85058949381,Australia;United States,georgeinstitute.org.au,George Inst Global Hlth;Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill,"George Inst Global Hlth, Australia;Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, United States","Dunford, Elizabeth K.; Ng, Shu Wen; Taillie, Lindsey Smith",,
Is about prices in medicines. I don't know if is relevant enough,No,"Background Increasing medicines availability and affordability is a key goal of Brazilian health policies. ""Farmacia Popular"" (FP) Program is one of the government's key strategies to achieve this goal. Under FP, antihypertension (HTN) and antiglycemic (DM) medicines have been provided at subsidized prices in private retail settings since 2006, and free of charge since 2011. We aim to assess the impact of sequential changes in FP benefits on patient affordability and government expenditures for HTN and DM treatment under the FP, and examine their implications for public financing mechanisms and program sustainability. Methods Longitudinal, retrospective study using interrupted time series to analyze: HTN and DM treatment coverage; total and per capita expenditure; percentage paid by MoH; and patient cost sharing. Analyzes were conducted in the dispensing database of the FP program (from 2006 to 2012). Results FP has increased its coverage over time; by December 2012 FP covered on average 13% of DM and 11.5% of HTN utilization, a growth of over 600 and 1500%, respectively. The overall cost per treatment to the MoH declined from R$36.43 (R$ = reais, the Brazilian currency) to 18.74 for HTN and from R$33.07to R$15.05 for DM over the period analyzed, representing a reduction in per capita cost greater than 50%. The amount paid by patients for the medicines covered increased over time until 2011, but then declined to zero. We estimate that to treat all patients in need for HTN and DM in 2012 under FP, the Government would need to expend 97% of the total medicines budget. Conclusions FP rapidly increased its coverage in terms of both program reach and proportion of cost subsidized during the period analyzed. Costs of individual HTN and DM treatments in FP were reduced after 2011 for both patients (free) and government (better negotiated prices). However, overall FP expenditures by MoH increased due to markedly increased utilization. The FP is sustainable as a complementary policy but cannot feasibly substitute for the distribution of medicines by the SUS.","Hypertension and diabetes treatment affordability and government expenditures following changes in patient cost sharing in the ""Farmacia popular"" program in Brazil: an interrupted time series study","Emmerick, I.C.M., Campos, M.N.R., da Silva, R.M., Chaves, L.A., Bertoldi, A.D., Ross-Degnan, D., Luiza, V.L.",2020,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,20,1,24,,,12,3,10.1186/s12889-019-8095-0,,"[Emmerick, Isabel Cristina Martins] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Surg, Div Thorac Surg, Sch Med, 67 Belmont St, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Emmerick, Isabel Cristina Martins] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Populat Med, 401 Pk Dr Suite 401, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Emmerick, Isabel Cristina Martins; Ross-Degnan, Dennis] Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care Inst, Landmark Ctr, 401 Pk Dr Suite 401, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Campos, Monica Rodrigues] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Sergio Arouca Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social Sci, 1480 Rua Leopoldo Bulhoes 905, BR-21041210 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [da Silva, Rondineli Mendes; Luiza, Vera Lucia] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Sergio Arouca Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Med & Pharmaceut Serv Policies, 1480 Rua Leopoldo Bulhoes 624, BR-21041210 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Chaves, Luisa Arueira] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Phamacy Dept, Ave Aluizio da Silva Gomes 50, BR-27930560 Granja Dos Cavaleiros, Macae, Brazil; [Bertoldi, Andrea Damaso] Univ Fed Pelotas, Postgrad Program Epidemiol, Rua Marechal Deodoro 1160, BR-96020220 Pelotas, RS, Brazil; [Ross-Degnan, Dennis] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Populat Med, 401 Pk Dr Suite 401, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,Non-communicable diseases; Affordability; Hypertension; Diabetes; Government expenditure; Medicines,,Non-communicable diseases;Affordability;Hypertension;Diabetes;Government expenditure;Medicines,emmerick.isabel@gmail.com,,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,,,BMC,,,,31914972,English,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,Article,WoS,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",WOS:000513530300003,2-s2.0-85077691048,United States;Brazil,gmail.com,Univ Massachusetts;Harvard Med Sch;Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care Inst;Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz;Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro;Univ Fed Pelotas,"Univ Massachusetts, United States;Harvard Med Sch, United States;Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care Inst, United States;Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Brazil;Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;Univ Fed Pelotas, Brazil","Emmerick, Isabel Cristina Martins; Campos, Monica Rodrigues; da Silva, Rondineli Mendes; Chaves, Luisa Arueira; Bertoldi, Andrea Damaso; Ross-Degnan, Dennis; Luiza, Vera Lucia",,
,No,"CfiA (CcrA) metallo-β-lactamase is the main carbapenem resistance mechanism in B. fragilis. From cfiA positive isolates detected in a previous surveillance study, 3 displayed resistance to imipenem while the remaining were susceptible. The aim of this study was to identify the cfiA alleles and to analyze the presence of IS elements in their upstream regions. CfiA-1, CfiA-4, CfiA-13, CfiA-19 and CfiA-22 were detected. IS elements belonging to IS21 family and IS942 group were identified upstream to cfiA in the 3 imipenem resistant isolates. We present an exhaustive analysis of cfiA/CfiA registers in databases, illustrating the inconsistencies in both organization and nomenclature. According to this analysis CfiA family comprises nowadays 15 different CfiA variants coded by 24 cfiA sequences. Curation of CfiA database is mandatory, if not new cfiA admission at GenBank will contribute to make this classification more complex. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Identification of CfiA coding genes in Bacteroides fragilis isolates recovered in Argentina.

They are creating a (non-open dataset) in Brazil and comparing with an open database,No,"Estimates show that 5–10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary, caused by genetic variants in autosomal dominant genes; of these, 16% are due to germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The comprehension of the mutation profile of these genes in the Brazilian population, particularly in Amazonian Amerindian groups, is scarce. We investigated fifteen polymorphisms in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in Amazonian Amerindians and compared the results with the findings of global populations publicly available in the 1000 Genomes Project database. Our study shows that three variants (rs11571769, rs144848, and rs11571707) of the BRCA2 gene, commonly associated with hereditary breast cancer, had a significantly higher allele frequency in the Amazonian Amerindian individuals in comparison with the African, American, European, and Asian groups analyzed. These data outline the singular genetic profiles of the indigenous population from the Brazilian Amazon region. The knowledge about BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants is critical to establish public policies for hereditary breast cancer screening in Amerindian groups and populations admixed with them, such as the Brazilian population. © 2021 by the authors.

This is not an open dataset,No,"Background: The EsPhALL2004 randomised trial showed a 10% advantage in disease-free survival for short, discontinuous use of imatinib after induction compared with no use of imatinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia receiving Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster chemotherapy and haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Other contemporary studies showed an advantage from continuous protracted exposure to imatinib, challenging the indications to transplant. The EsPhALL2010 study was designed to assess whether imatinib given from day 15 of induction and continuously throughout chemotherapy led to a different outcome to that obtained in EsPhALL2004, despite decreasing the number of patients having HSCT. Methods: This prospective, intergroup, open-label, single-arm clinical trial (EsPhALL2010) was done at 11 study groups across Europe, Chile, and Hong Kong. Patients aged 1–17 years with the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) who were recruited into national front-line trials for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were eligible for this trial. Patients with abnormal renal or hepatic function or an active systemic infection were ineligible. Patients received imatinib 300 mg/m2 continuously from day 15 of induction during chemotherapy. Eligibility to HSCT depended on early morphological response and minimal residual disease. Imatinib was recommended throughout the first year after transplant. The co-primary endpoints were event-free survival and overall survival. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT 2004-001647-30) and with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00287105) and is completed. Findings: 158 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 155 were enrolled between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2014. 151 (97%) patients achieved first complete remission after induction and four after the consolidation phase, with 102 (66%) patients categorised as good risk and 53 (34%) as poor risk according to EsPhALL risk stratification criteria. 59 (38%) patients had HSCT during their first complete remission. 40 (26%) patients relapsed and 41 (26%) patients died during the study (25 [61%] during complete continuous remission, and 16 [39%] after relapse). The 5-year event-free survival was 57·0% (95% CI 48·5–64·6) and 5-year overall survival was 71·8% (63·5–78·5). 154 serious adverse events were reported in 80 (52%) of 155 patients. The most common toxicity was infection (61 [39%] patients, mostly bacterial); gastrointestinal disorders occurred in ten (6%) patients and osteonecrosis in eight (5%). Serious adverse events occurred mainly during high-risk blocks and delayed intensifications, including 14 fatal events (one in the consolidation phase, six in high-risk blocks, six in first delayed intensification, and one in second delayed intensification). Interpretation: Although HSCT was done in a smaller proportion of patients in EsPhALL2010 than in EsPhALL2004, event-free and overall survival were similar between the two studies. Our data suggest that imatinib given early and continuously with intensive chemotherapy might increase toxicity.

hospitalization data of children in Brazilian public health system with an admission diagnosis of pneumonia was performed comparing pre and post-vaccination periods. Hospital number of admission due to pneumonia and all non-respiratory diseases were obtained from DATASUS,Yes,"Introduction: Pneumococcal disease is a major public health problem worldwide. From March to September of 2010, 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) was introduced in the Brazilian childhood National Immunization Program (NIP) in all 27 Brazilian states. The aim of the present study is to report national time-trends in incidence of hospital admissions for childhood pneumonia in Brazil before and after two years of introduction of this new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Methods: Analysis of hospitalization data of children aged 0-4 years in Brazilian public health system with an admission diagnosis of pneumonia from 2002 to 2012 was performed comparing pre (2002-2009) and post-vaccination periods (2011-2012). Hospital number of admission due to pneumonia and all non-respiratory diseases were obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian government open-access public health database system. Incidence of pneumonia hospitalization was compared to incidence of all non-respiratory admissions. Results: Admission rates for pneumonia decreased steadily from 2010 to 2012. In children aged less than four years, incidence of pneumonia hospitalizations decreased 12.65% when pre (2002-2009) and post-vaccination introduction periods (2011-2012) were compared and adjusted for seasonality and secular-trend (p < 0.001). On the other hand, non-respiratory admission rates remained stable comparing both periods (p = 0.39). Conclusion: Childhood pneumonia hospitalization rates were fluctuating prior to 2010 and decreased significantly in the two years after PHiD-CV introduction. Conversely, rate of non-respiratory admissions has shown no decrease. These data are an evidence of the effectiveness and public health impact of this new pneumococcal vaccine. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This is not an open dataset,No,"Background: COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, has brought extensive challenges to the scientific community in recent months. Several studies have been undertaken in an attempt to minimize the impact of the disease worldwide. Although new knowledge has been quickly disseminated, including viral mechanisms, pathophysiology, and clinical findings, there is a lack of information on the effective pharmacological management of this disease. In vitro studies have shown some benefits related to the use of antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. However, the data from open clinical trials on COVID-19 patients are controversial. Objective: We present the protocol for a research project that compares the potential protective effect of antimalarials in preventing moderate-to-severe forms of COVID-19 in two groups: (1) patients treated chronically with antimalarials for rheumatic diseases and (2) other members of the patients' household who have not been diagnosed with rheumatic diseases and are not taking antimalarials. Methods: This is a 24-week, prospective, observational cohort study comprising patients from public and private health services across Brazil, who chronically use antimalarials for the treatment of immune-mediated rheumatic diseases, osteoarthritis, or chikungunya-related arthropathy. A total of six sequential phone interviews were scheduled during the COVID-19 outbreak in five different regions of Brazil. Information regarding social, epidemiological, and demographic data, as well as details about rheumatic diseases, antimalarials, comorbidities, and concomitant medication, is being recorded using a specific online form in the REDCap database. Symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, including fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia, and dysgeusia, are being self-reported and collected via phone interviews. Our main outcomes are hospitalization, need of intensive care unit, and death. Results: Recruitment began at the end of March 2020, and the inclusion was done during an 8-week period (from March 29 to May 17) with a total of 10,443 individuals enrolled at baseline, 5166 of whom have rheumatic diseases, from 23 tertiary rheumatology centers across 97 Brazilian cities. Data analysis is scheduled to begin after all inclusion data have been collected.

Methods: Monthly vaccination and birth data from the DATASUS (Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System) database of the Ministry of Health of Brazil were obtained from January 2017 to December 2020. Interrupted time series analysis was used to compare vaccination trends before and after March 2020, when isolation measures were first implemented in Brazil. Results: There was no strong evidence of a significant change in trends during the study period, or before and during the pandemic at national level. However, the mean number of vaccinations per child was 10.6, which is lower than the 13 doses expected under the immunization schedule. Conclusions: Although the pandemic did not appreciably impact on vaccinations, incomplete immunization among children aged <1 year in Brazil is cause for concern. A potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific antigens or regional and sociodemographic disparities in vaccinations cannot be ruled out without further research. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

"Is an open survey, not an open dataset",No,"Introduction: In Colombia from March 24 to August 31, 2020, children and adolescents spent 162 days in total mandatory preventive isolation due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Objective: To know and evaluate their behavior of children and adolescents during this period of confinement in order to establish the consequences on the physical activity and weight gain. Methods: An open virtual survey was developed on the Google survey platform, addressed to parents with 5 questions: 1. How old is your child: 2. How many minutes of physical activity at home do you do? 3. How many minutes of screens (TV, computer, cell phone, video games, etc.) her or she watch per day? 4. How many hours does he or she sleep at night? 5. Has your child's body weight increased? How much? This survey was distributed in the databases of the Association of Sports Medicine and the Colombian Heart Foundation through social networks such as WhatsApp and emails. Results: 1,139 virtual surveys were conducted. It was found that during the mandatory isolation period: 75.2% of the children did not perform the minutes of physical activity recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), that 82.8% exceeded the time of 60 minutes versus to electronic devices and that 44% weight gained. Conclusions: In periods of confinement, it is important to design educational strategies and processes that promote healthy lifestyles in children that can be preserved in the future in adults. © 2020 Sociedad Colombiana de Cardiología y Cirugía Cardiovascular",Impact of mandatory preventive isolation on daily physical activity and weight of children during the SARS-cov-2 pandemic [Impacto del aislamiento preventivo obligatorio en la actividad física diaria y en el peso de los niños durante la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2],"Arevalo H., Triana M.U., Santacruz J.C.",2020,Revista Colombiana de Cardiologia,27,6,,575,582,,10,10.1016/j.rccar.2020.09.003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097102770&doi=10.1016%2fj.rccar.2020.09.003&partnerID=40&md5=402621178a9912e2f30b26cf8caa7102,"Médico del deporte, Presidente Asociación De Medicina del deporte de Colombia; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia; Director Ejecutivo Fundación Colombiana del Corazón","Arévalo, H., Médico del deporte, Presidente Asociación De Medicina del deporte de Colombia; Triana, M.U., Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia; Santacruz, J.C., Director Ejecutivo Fundación Colombiana del Corazón",Children; COVID-19; Feeding; Isolation; Overweight; Physical activity,adolescent behavior; Article; body weight; body weight gain; child; child behavior; clinical evaluation; coronavirus disease 2019; e-mail; health survey; healthy lifestyle; home care; human; physical activity; screen time; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social isolation; social network; sports medicine; video game; virtual reality; World Health Organization,Children;COVID-19;Feeding;Isolation;Overweight;Physical activity;adolescent behavior;Article;body weight;body weight gain;child;child behavior;clinical evaluation;coronavirus disease 2019;e-mail;health survey;healthy lifestyle;home care;human;screen time;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;social isolation;social network;sports medicine;video game;virtual reality;World Health Organization,"Santacruz, J.C.; Director Ejecutivo Fundación Colombiana del Corazónemail: jcsantacruz@corazonesresponsables.org",,,,,,Elsevier B.V.,1205633,,,,English; Spanish,Rev.

"his study is based on publicly available material obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian Ministry of Health's data processing system, on numbers of surgical procedures and death rates",Yes,"Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a worldwide challenge, and efforts to ""flatten the curve,"" including restrictions imposed by policymakers and medical societies, have forced a reduction in the number of procedures performed in the Brazilian Health Care System. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) from 2008 to 2020 in the SUS and to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the number of procedures and death rate of CABG performed in 2020 through the database DATASUS. Methods This study is based on publicly available material obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian Ministry of Health's data processing system, on numbers of surgical procedures and death rates. Only isolated CABG procedures were included in our study. We used the TabNet software from the DATASUS website to generate reports. Results We identified 281,760 CABG procedures performed from January 2008 to December 2020. The average number of procedures until the end of 2019 was of 22,104. During 2020 there was a 25% reduction CABG procedures, to 16,501. There was an increase in the national death rate caused by a statistical significant increase in death rates in Brazil's Southeast and Central-west regions. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global challenge for Brazil's health care system. During the year of 2020 there was a reduction in access to CABG related to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.

"flu-related Internet search activity and historical information to monitor flu activity, named ARGO (AutoRegression with Google search) and an influenza surveillance database maintained by the World Health Organization",Yes,"Background: Novel influenza surveillance systems that leverage Internet-based real-time data sources including Internet search frequencies, social-network information, and crowd-sourced flu surveillance tools have shown improved accuracy over the past few years in data-rich countries like the United States. These systems not only track flu activity accurately, but they also report flu estimates a week or more ahead of the publication of reports produced by healthcare-based systems, such as those implemented and managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Previous work has shown that the predictive capabilities of novel flu surveillance systems, like Google Flu Trends (GFT), in developing countries in Latin America have not yet delivered acceptable flu estimates. Objective: The aim of this study was to show that recent methodological improvements on the use of Internet search engine information to track diseases can lead to improved retrospective flu estimates in multiple countries in Latin America. Methods: A machine learning-based methodology that uses flu-related Internet search activity and historical information to monitor flu activity, named ARGO (AutoRegression with Google search), was extended to generate flu predictions for 8 Latin American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay) for the time period: January 2012 to December of 2016. These retrospective (out-of-sample) Influenza activity predictions were compared with historically observed flu suspected cases in each country, as reported by Flunet, an influenza surveillance database maintained by the World Health Organization. For a baseline comparison, retrospective (out-of-sample) flu estimates were produced for the same time period using autoregressive models that only leverage historical flu activity information. Results: Our results show that ARGO-like models' predictive power outperform autoregressive models in 6 out of 8 countries in the 2012-2016 time period. Moreover, ARGO significantly improves on historical flu estimates produced by the now discontinued GFT for the time period of 2012-2015, where GFT information is publicly available. Conclusions: We demonstrate here that a self-correcting machine learning method, leveraging Internet-based disease-related search activity and historical flu trends, has the potential to produce reliable and timely flu estimates in multiple Latin American countries. This methodology may prove helpful to local public health officials who design and implement interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of influenza outbreaks.

"We used a Brazilian dataset of new AIDS cases and deaths, which is publicly available",Yes,"Currently, it is estimated that 37.6 million people are living with the HIV/AIDS virus worldwide, placing HIV/AIDS among the ten leading causes of death, mostly among low- and lower-middle-income countries. Despite the effective intervention in the prevention and treatment, this reduction did not occur equally among populations, subpopulations and geographic regions. This difference in the occurrence of the disease is associated with the social determinants of health (SDH), which could affect the transmission and maintenance of HIV. With the recognition of the importance of SDH in HIV transmission, the development of mathematical models that incorporate these determinants could increase the accuracy and robustness of the modeling. This article aims to propose a theoretical and conceptual way of including SDH in the mathematical modeling of HIV/AIDS. The theoretical mathematical model with the Social Determinants of Health has been developed in stages. For the selection of SDH that were incorporated into the model, a narrative literature review was conducted. Secondly, we proposed an extended model in which the population (N) is divided into Susceptible (S), HIV-positive (I), Individual with AIDS (A) and individual under treatment (T). Each SDH had a different approach to embedding in the model. We performed a calibration and validation of the model. A total of 31 SDH were obtained in the review, divided into four groups: Individual Factors, Socioeconomic Factors, Social Participation, and Health Services. In the end, four determinants were selected for incorporation into the model: Education, Poverty, Use of Drugs and Alcohol abuse, and Condoms Use. the section ""Numerical simulation"" to simulate the influence of the poverty rate on the AIDS incidence and mortality rates. We used a Brazilian dataset of new AIDS cases and deaths, which is publicly available. We calibrated the model using a multiobjective genetic algorithm for the years 2003 to 2019. To forecast from 2020 to 2035, we assumed two lines of poverty rate representing (i) a scenario of increasing and (ii) a scenario of decreasing. To avoid overfitting, we fixed some parameters and estimated the remaining. The equations presented with the chosen SDH exemplify some approaches that we can adopt when thinking about modeling social effects on the occurrence of HIV. The model was able to capture the influence of the employment/poverty on the HIV/AIDS incidence and mortality rates, evidencing the importance of SDOH in the occurrence of diseases. The recognition of the importance of including the SDH in the modeling and studies on HIV/AIDS is evident, due to its complexity and multicausality.

The data were extracted from the public database (DATASUS) of Brazil's Ministry of Health,Yes,"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the pathogen SARS-CoV-2, was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Recently, studies have discussed reports of patients infected with COVID-19 associated with vesicular manifestations of Herpes Zoster. The objective of this study was to compare the data from the Unified Health System (SUS) on the number of diagnoses of Herpes Zoster from March to August from 2017 to 2019, with the same period in 2020, in the five Brazilian regions (North, Northeast, Southeast, South, and Midwest). The data were extracted from the public database (DATASUS) of Brazil's Ministry of Health. The data showed an increase in the number of Herpes Zoster diagnoses over the years and the negative impact from the COVID-19 disease, revealing an average increase corresponding to an extra 10.7 cases per million inhabitants during the pandemic in all Brazilian Regions. Therefore, although the association between HZ and COVID-19 is not well established, we observed in this study an increase in HZ cases during the COVID -19 pandemic, which suggests a correlation between these diseases. ? 2021 The Authors.

"Data from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records (including COVID-19 notifications), were used in this study",Yes,"Objectives: Concerns about the increasing impact of severe COVID-19 in younger individuals in Brazil came after a recent synchronised country-wide wave of cases in Brazil. This communication analyses how hospitalisations due to COVID-19 changed in the age groups 18-49 years and >= 70 years. Study design: Longitudinal study based on secondary data. Methods: Data from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records (including COVID-19 notifications), were used in this study. Statistical control charts examined changes in the magnitude and variation of younger (18-49 years) and older (>= 70 years) adults who were hospitalised between 15th March 2020 and 19th June 2021. Results: During the few first weeks of the pandemic in Brazil, the number of COVID-19 hospitalisations increased in older adults but decreased in younger adults. Subsequently, hospitalisations reached statistical control zones in epidemiological weeks (EW) 19-48 of 2020 (EW 19-48/2020) and EW 03-05/2021 (18-49 y, mean = 26.1%; >= 70 y, mean = 32.8%). Between EW 49/2020 and EW 02/2021, the number of hospitalisations of younger adults dropped to levels below the lower control limit. In contrast, the number of hospitalisations of older adults surpassed the upper limit of the corresponding statistical control zones. However, from EW 06/2021, numbers of hospitalisations changed from statistical control zones, with hospitalisations of younger adults increasing and reaching 44.9% in EW 24/2021 and hospitalisations of older adults decreasing until EW 19/2021 (14.1%) and reaching 17.3% in EW 24/2021. Conclusions: An increasing number of COVID-19 hospitalisations were observed in younger adults from EW 06/2021. This could be a result of the successful vaccination programme in older adults, who were initially prioritised, and possibly an increased exposure to highly transmissible variants of COVID-19 in younger adults who had to go to work in the absence of social protection (i.e. government financial support). Potential consequences of COVID-19 hospitalisations in younger adults could include a reduced life expectancy of the population and an increased number of people unable to perform daily activities due to post-COVID-19 conditions.

They are not using an open database,No,"Background: The indiscriminate use of antibiotics in food-animal production has a major impact on public health, particularly in terms of contributing to the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in the food-animal production chain. Although Pseudomonas species are recognized as important spoilage organisms in foodstuff, they are also known as opportunistic pathogens associated with hospital-acquired infections. Furthermore, Pseudomonas can play a role as potential reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance genes, which may be horizontally transferred to other bacteria. Considering that cephalosporins (3rd and higher generations) and carbapenems are critically important beta-lactam antimicrobials in human medicine, this study reports the occurrence and genomic characterization of a meropenem-nonsusceptible Pseudomonas otitidis strain recovered from a chicken carcass in Brazil. Materials, Methods & Results: During the years 2018-2019, 72 frozen chicken carcasses were purchased on the retail market from different regions in Brazil. Aliquots from individual carcass rinses were screened for Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria in MacConkey agar supplemented with 1mg.L-1 cefotaxime. Phenotypically resistant isolates were further tested for resistance to other antimicrobials and confirmed as ESBL-producers by means of disk-diffusion method using Muller-Hinton agar. Only one meropenen-nonsusceptible isolate was detected and submitted to whole genome sequencing (WGS) in Illumina Miseq. The strain was identified as Pseudomonas otitidis by local alignment of the 16S rRNA sequence using BLASTn and confirmed by Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) analysis using JspeciesWS database. Genes encoding for antimicrobial resistance were detected by means of Resfinder and Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) databases. The phenotypic non-susceptibility to meropenen was attributed to the gene bla POM-1. A total of 192 different genes encoding for quorum sensing system, antiphagocytosis, iron uptake, efflux pump, endotoxin and toxin, adherence, and secretion systems were detected by means of Virulence Factor Database (VFDB). Pseudomonas otitidis-pan genome was built using Roary-rapid large-scale prokaryote pan genome analysis using the present strain (K_25) and other two P. otitidis genomes (PAM-1, DSM 17224) publicly available at the NCBI. The core genome analysis of the two human strains resulted in similar percentages. Discussion: Carbapenems are critically important drugs for human health and bacterial strains resistant to these antimicrobials pose a public health problem. The bla POM-1 gene harbored by the Pseudomonas otitidis K_25 strain encodes a metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) conferring resistance to carbapenems. Pseudomonas otitidis was the first confirmed pathogenic Pseudomonas species expressing MBL constitutively in the absence of inducible beta-lactamase genes. Furthermore, the several virulence genes associated with the capacity of the P. otitidis K_25 to colonize, evade the immune system and cause lesions in the human host confirm this strain as a potential opportunistic pathogen contaminating foodstuff. These reinforce the need to address antimicrobial resistance in a One Health perspective, in which resistant bacteria and resistance determinants circulate among environment, animals and humans.",In-Depth Genomic Characterization of a Meropenem-nonsusceptible Pseudomonas otitidis Strain Contaminating Chicken Carcass,"Vieira, T.R., Sambrano, G.E., da Silva, N.M.V., Vasconcelos, P.C., de Oliveira, E.F.C., de Oliveira, C.J.B., Cibulski, S.P., Cardoso, M.",2020,ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE,48,,1743,,,6,1,10.22456/1679-9216.103176,,"[Vieira, Tatiana Regina; Sambrano, Gustavo Enck; Cavinatto de Oliveira, Esther Ferraza; Cardoso, Marisa] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Dept Med Vet Prevent, Fac Med Vet, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Vieira da Silva, Nubia Michelle; Vasconcelos, Priscylla Carvalho; Bruno de Oliveira, Celso Jose; Cibulski, Samuel Paulo] Univ Fed Paraiba LTPB, Lab Avaliacao Prod Origem Anim LAPOA, Dept Zootecnia, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Areia, PB, Brazil; [Vieira da Silva, Nubia Michelle; Vasconcelos, Priscylla Carvalho; Bruno de Oliveira, Celso Jose; Cibulski, Samuel Paulo] Univ Fed Paraiba LTPB, Lab Biotecnol Celular & Mol, Ctr Biotecnol Cbiotec, Areia, PB, Brazil; [Bruno de Oliveira, Celso Jose] Ohio State Univ, Global One Hlth Initiat GOHi, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,carbapenem-resistance; POM-1; Pseudomonas otitidis; Brazil,ALGORITHM,carbapenem-resistance;POM-1;Pseudomonas otitidis;Brazil;ALGORITHM,tatianareginavieira@gmail.com,,"FAC VET, CAIXA POSTAL 15017, PORTO ALEGRE RS, 91501-570, BRAZIL",,,,UNIV FED RIO GRANDE DO SUL,1678-0345,,,,English,ACTA SCI VET,Article,WoS,Veterinary Sciences,WOS:000546353600001,2-s2.0-85092375096,Brazil;United States,gmail.com,Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS;Univ Fed Paraiba LTPB;Ohio State Univ,"Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Brazil;Univ Fed Paraiba LTPB, Brazil;Ohio State Univ, United States","Vieira, Tatiana Regina; Sambrano, Gustavo Enck; Vieira da Silva, Nubia Michelle; Vasconcelos, Priscylla Carvalho; Cavinatto de Oliveira, Esther Ferraza; Bruno de Oliveira, Celso Jose; Cibulski, Samuel Paulo; Cardoso, Marisa",,
They don't mention the data source,No,"Aims: To identify pharmacogenetic and demographic variables that influence the systemic exposure to metformin in an admixed Brazilian cohort. Methods: The extreme discordant phenotype was used to select 106 data sets from nine metformin bioequivalence trials, comprising 256 healthy adults. Eleven single-nucleotide polymorphisms in SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC47A1 SLC47A2 and in transcription factor SP1 were genotyped and a validated panel of ancestry informative markers was used to estimate the individual proportions of biogeographical ancestry. Two-step (univariate followed by multivariate) regression modelling was developed to identify covariates associated with systemic exposure to metformin, accessed by the area under the plasma concentration–time curve, between 0 and 48 h (AUC 0–48h ), after single oral doses of metformin (500 or 1000 mg). Results: The individual proportions of African, Amerindian and European ancestry varied widely, as anticipated from the structure of the Brazilian population The dose-adjusted, log-transformed AUC 0–48h 's (ng h ml −1  mg −1 ) differed largely in the two groups at the opposite ends of the distribution histogram, namely 0.82, 0.79–0.85 and 1.08, 1.06–1.11 (mean, 95% confidence interval; P = 6.10 −26 , t test). Multivariate modelling revealed that metformin AUC 0–48h increased with age, food and carriage of rs12208357 in SLC22A1 but was inversely associated with body surface area and individual proportions of African ancestry. Conclusions: A pharmacogenetic marker in OCT1 (SLC22A1 rs12208357), combined with demographic covariates (age, body surface area and individual proportion of African ancestry) and a food effect explained 29.7% of the variability in metformin AUC 0–48h . © 2018 The British Pharmacological Society",Influence of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms and demographic variables on metformin pharmacokinetics in an admixed Brazilian cohort,"Santoro A.B., Botton M.R., Struchiner C.J., Suarez-Kurtz G.",2018,British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology,84,5,,987,996,,13,10.1111/bcp.13522,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042454019&doi=10.1111%2fbcp.13522&partnerID=40&md5=6b7c914624e8758e35fa2758cf23dc6a,"Coordenação de Pesquisa, Instituto Nacional de Câncer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Departamento de Genética, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Programa de Computação Científica, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Santoro, A.B., Coordenação de Pesquisa, Instituto Nacional de Câncer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Botton, M.R., Departamento de Genética, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Struchiner, C.J., Programa de Computação Científica, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Suarez-Kurtz, G., Coordenação de Pesquisa, Instituto Nacional de Câncer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",biogeographical ancestry; extreme discordant phenotype; metformin pharmacokinetics; SLC22; SLC47; SP1,"genomic DNA; metformin; multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1; multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 2; organic cation transporter 1; organic cation transporter 2; transcription factor Sp1; metformin; organic cation transporter; transcription factor Sp1; adult; African; American Indian; area under the curve; Article; bioequivalence; biogeographic region; body surface; Brazilian; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; crossover procedure; demography; ethnic difference; European; female; gene linkage disequilibrium; genotype; haplotype; human; male; normal human; open study; pharmacogenetics; pharmacokinetic parameters; phenotype; plasma concentration-time curve; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; single drug dose; single nucleotide polymorphism; Black person; blood; Brazil; Caucasian; demography; genetics; randomized controlled trial (topic); single nucleotide polymorphism; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Brazil; Demography; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genotype; Haplotypes; Humans; Indians, South American; Linkage Disequilibrium; Male; Metformin; Organic Cation Transport Proteins; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sp1 Transcription Factor","biogeographical ancestry;extreme discordant phenotype;metformin pharmacokinetics;SLC22;SLC47;SP1;genomic DNA;metformin;multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1;multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 2;organic cation transporter 1;organic cation transporter 2;transcription factor Sp1;organic cation transporter;adult;African;American Indian;area under the curve;Article;bioequivalence;biogeographic region;body surface;Brazilian;cohort analysis;comparative study;controlled study;crossover procedure;demography;ethnic difference;European;female;gene linkage disequilibrium;genotype;haplotype;human;male;normal human;open study;pharmacogenetics;pharmacokinetic parameters;phenotype;plasma concentration-time curve;priority journal;randomized controlled trial;single drug dose;single nucleotide polymorphism;Black person;blood;Brazil;Caucasian;genetics;randomized controlled trial (topic);African Continental Ancestry Group;European Continental Ancestry Group;Haplotypes;Humans;Indians, South American;Linkage Disequilibrium;Organic Cation Transport Proteins;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Sp1 Transcription Factor","Suarez-Kurtz, G.; Coordenação de Pesquisa, Brazil; email: kurtz@inca.gov.br",,,,,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,3065251,,BCPHB,29352482,English,Br.

cross-sectional design using the publicly available database from the last Chilean National Health Survey,Yes,"Dietary habits are determinants in the development of a range of conditions and age-related diseases. We explored the associations of sociodemographic, health-related indicators, and health behavioral factors on dietary guideline compliance in elderly Chileans. We used a cross-sectional design using the publicly available database from the last Chilean National Health Survey (2016-17). The sample of 1831 older adults (>= 60 y) from a national representative sample. The dependent variable was compliance with Food Guidelines (FG) (daily consumption of water, dairy, and fruits and vegetables; and weekly consumption of legumes and fish). The independent variables included sociodemographic, health-related, and behavioral factors. Over half (51.8%) of the sample was female and 85.7% belonged to the 60-79 age group. Satisfactory compliance to FG was observed in 3.9% of the sample. In the adjusted analysis, for those between 60 and 79 y, marital status was the only significant variable associated with FG noncompliance (PR: 1.34; 95%CI: 1.04-1.71). For those over 80 y, income of >2 minimum wages (PR: 0.10; 95%CI: 0.02-0.61), living alone (PR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.20-2.47), and self-reported cardiovascular disease (PR: 0.63; 95%CI: 0.43-0.93) were associated with FG noncompliance. We observed low FG compliance among elderly Chilean adults, especially in the oldest group.

Is not a public dataset,No,"Objectives The aim of this work is to demonstrate the use of a standardized health informatics framework to generate reliable and reproducible real-world evidence from Latin America and South Asia towards characterizing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Global South. Materials and Methods Patient-level COVID-19 records collected in a patient self-reported notification system, hospital in-patient and out-patient records, and community diagnostic labs were harmonized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model and analyzed using a federated network analytics framework. Clinical characteristics of individuals tested for, diagnosed with or tested positive for, hospitalized with, admitted to intensive care unit with, or dying with COVID-19 were estimated. Results Two COVID-19 databases covering 8.3 million people from Pakistan and 2.6 million people from Bahia, Brazil were analyzed. 109 504 (Pakistan) and 921 (Brazil) medical concepts were harmonized to Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model. In total, 341 505 (4.1%) people in the Pakistan dataset and 1 312 832 (49.2%) people in the Brazilian dataset were tested for COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 20, 2022, with a median [IQR] age of 36 [25, 76] and 38 (27, 50); 40.3% and 56.5% were female in Pakistan and Brazil, respectively. 1.2% percent individuals in the Pakistan dataset had Afghan ethnicity. In Brazil, 52.3% had mixed ethnicity. In agreement with international findings, COVID-19 outcomes were more severe in men, elderly, and those with underlying health conditions. Conclusions COVID-19 data from 2 large countries in the Global South were harmonized and analyzed using a standardized health informatics framework developed by an international community of health informaticians.

Is in Canada,No,"Despite undeniable progress, the mining industry remains the scene of serious accidents revealing disregard for occupational health and safety (OHS) and leaving open the debate regarding the safety of its employees. The San Jose mine last collapse near Copiapo, Chile on 5 August 2010 and the 69-day rescue operation that followed in order to save 33 miners trapped underground show the serious consequences of neglecting worker health and safety. The aim of this study was to validate a new approach to integrating OHS into risk management in the context of a new open-pit mining project in Quebec, based on analysis of incident and accident reports, semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and collaborative field observations. We propose a new concept, called hazard concentration, based on the number of hazards and their influence. This concept represents the weighted fraction of each category of hazards related to an undesirable event. The weight of each category of hazards is calculated by AHP, a multicriteria method.

"Is a platofm, not a db",No,"Background: Testing, traceability, and isolation actions are a central strategy defined by the World Health Organization to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. In this sense, the countries have had difficulties in counting the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Errors in reporting results are a common factor, as well as the lack of interoperability between laboratories and governments. Approaches aimed at sending spreadsheets via email expose patients' privacy and have increased the probability of errors due to retyping, which generates a delay in the notification of results. Objective: This study aims to design and develop an interoperable platform to report polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 tests from laboratories to the Chilean government. Methods: The methodology to design and develop the interoperable platform was comprised of six well-structured stages: (1) creation of a minimum data set for PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, (2) modeling processes and end points where institutions interchange information, (3) standards and interoperability design, (4) software development, (5) software testing, and (6) software implementation. Results: The interoperable Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) platform to report PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests from laboratories to the Chilean government was successfully implemented. The platform was designed, developed, tested, and implemented following a structured methodology. The platform's performance to 1000 requests resulted in a response time of 240 milliseconds, throughput of 28.3 requests per second, and process management time of 131 milliseconds. The security was assured through a private network exclusive to the Ministry of Health to ensure confidentiality and integrity. The authorization and authentication of laboratories were implemented with a JavaScript Object Notation Web Token. All the PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests were accessible through an application programming interface gateway with valid credentials and the right access control list. Conclusions: The platform was implemented and is currently being used by UC Christus Laboratory. The platform is secure. It was tested adequately for confidentiality, secure authorization, authentication, and message integrity. This platform simplifies the reporting of PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and reduces the time and probability of mistakes in counting positive cases. The interoperable solution with FHIR is working successfully and is open for the community, laboratories, and any institution that needs to report PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests.",Interoperable Platform to Report Polymerase Chain Reaction SARS-CoV-2 Tests From Laboratories to the Chilean Government: Development and Implementation Study,"Guinez-Molinos, S., Andrade, J.M., Negrete, A.M., Vidal, S.E., Rios, E.",2021,JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS,9,1,e25149,,,16,1,10.2196/25149,,"[Guinez-Molinos, Sergio] Univ Talca, Sch Med, Lab Biomed Informat, Campus San Miguel,Avda San Miguel S-N, Talca 3460000, Chile; [Maria Andrade, Jose; Medina Negrete, Alejandro; Espinoza Vidal, Sonia; Rios, Elvis] Natl Ctr Hlth Informat Syst, Interoperabil Area, Talca, Chile",,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; interoperability; laboratory information system; HL7 FHIR; PCR,HEALTH-CARE; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; QUALITY,COVID-19;SARS-CoV-2;interoperability;laboratory information system;HL7 FHIR;PCR;HEALTH-CARE;INFORMATION-SYSTEMS;QUALITY,sguinez@utalca.cl,,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",,,,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",,,,33417587,English,JMIR MED INF,Article,WoS,Medical Informatics,WOS:000615044100013,2-s2.0-85100265812,Chile,utalca.cl,Univ Talca;Natl Ctr Hlth Informat Syst,"Univ Talca, Chile;Natl Ctr Hlth Informat Syst, Chile","Guinez-Molinos, Sergio; Maria Andrade, Jose; Medina Negrete, Alejandro; Espinoza Vidal, Sonia; Rios, Elvis",,

They created an open dataset. The database of laboratory exams was weighed and made publicly available on the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation’s PNS website,Yes,"Introduction: This article aims at describing the National Health Survey (Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde — PNS) methodology of collecting laboratory exams data. Methodology: A subsample of 25% of the census tracts was selected, according to the stratification of the PNS sample, with a probability inversely proportional to the difficulty of collection. The collection of blood and urine was done in the households by a laboratory agent, among residents selected for individual interview. Due to the difficulties found in the field work, the sample did not reach the minimum expected number in some strata, and a post-stratification procedure was proposed for the data analysis. Results: The collection of biospecimens was performed in 8,952 individuals. Laboratory tests were: glycated hemoglobin; total cholesterol; LDL cholesterol; HDL cholesterol; serology for dengue; red blood cell count (erythrogram) and white series count (leukogram); high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies; creatinine. The excretion of potassium, salt and sodium and creatinine was estimated in the urine. The database of laboratory exams was weighed and made publicly available on the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation’s PNS website and can be accessed without prior authorization. Conclusion: The total subsample of laboratory exams is of great value, since it allowed us to establish national reference parameters adequate to sociodemographic and geographic characteristics of the Brazilian population, providing relevant and complementary information for the analysis of the health situation of Brazil. © 2019 Associação Brasileira de Saúde Coletiva.","Laboratory exams of the national health survey: Methodology of sampling, data collection and analysis [Exames laboratoriais da pesquisa nacional de saúde: Metodologia de amostragem, coleta e análise dos dados]","Szwarcwald C.L., Malta D.C., de Souza Junior P.R.B., de Almeida W.D.S., Damacena G.N., Pereira C.A., Rosenfeld L.G.",2019,Revista Brasileira de Epidemiologia,22,,E190004.SUPL.2,,,,21,10.1590/1980-549720190004.supl.2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073071364&doi=10.1590%2f1980-549720190004.supl.2&partnerID=40&md5=f8be35c0ba3e2fabcd5f2f0057fdd4f8,"Institute for Communication and Scientific and Technological Information in Health, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; Department of Maternal Child Nursing and Public Health, School of Nursing, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; Hematology Center of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil","Szwarcwald, C.L., Institute for Communication and Scientific and Technological Information in Health, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; Malta, D.C., Department of Maternal Child Nursing and Public Health, School of Nursing, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; de Souza Júnior, P.R.B., Institute for Communication and Scientific and Technological Information in Health, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; de Almeida, W.D.S., Institute for Communication and Scientific and Technological Information in Health, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; Damacena, G.N., Institute for Communication and Scientific and Technological Information in Health, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; Pereira, C.A., Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; Rosenfeld, L.G., Hematology Center of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil",Blood specimen collection; Clinical laboratory techniques; Health surveys; Sampling studies; Urine specimen collection,"cholesterol; adolescent; adult; blood; blood sampling; Brazil; dengue; erythrocyte count; factual database; female; health survey; high performance liquid chromatography; human; information processing; laboratory technique; leukocyte count; male; middle aged; procedures; urine sampling; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Blood Specimen Collection; Brazil; Cholesterol; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Data Collection; Databases, Factual; Dengue; Erythrocyte Count; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Male; Middle Aged; Urine Specimen Collection; Young Adult","Blood specimen collection;Clinical laboratory techniques;Health surveys;Sampling studies;Urine specimen collection;cholesterol;adolescent;adult;blood;blood sampling;Brazil;dengue;erythrocyte count;factual database;female;health survey;high performance liquid chromatography;human;information processing;laboratory technique;leukocyte count;male;middle aged;procedures;urine sampling;young adult;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Data Collection;Databases, Factual;Humans","Szwarcwald, C.L.Avenida Brasil, 4.365, 2º andar sala 225, Brazil; email: celia.szwarcwald@icict.fiocruz.br",,,,,,"Assocaicao Brasileira de Pos, Gradacao em Saude Coletiva",1415790X,,,31596375,English,Rev.

These data were organized in a public repository named LeishDB (www.leishdb.com),Yes,"Leishmania braziliensis is the etiological agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disease with high public health importance, affecting 12 million people worldwide. Although its genome sequence was originally published in 2007, the two reference public annotations still presents at least 80% of the genes simply classified as hypothetical or putative proteins. Furthermore, it is notable the absence of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences from Leishmania species in public databases. These poorly annotated coding genes and ncRNAs could be important players for the understanding of this protozoan biology, the mechanisms behind host-parasite interactions and disease control. Herein, we performed a new prediction and annotation of L. braziliensis protein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs, using recently developed predictive algorithms and updated databases. In summary, we identified 11 491 ORFs, with 5263 (45.80%) of them associated with proteins available in public databases. Moreover, we identified for the first time the repertoire of 11 243 ncRNAs belonging to different classes distributed along the genome. The accuracy of our predictions was verified by transcriptional evidence using RNA-seq, confirming that they are actually generating real transcripts. These data were organized in a public repository named LeishDB (www.leishdb.com), which represents an improvement on the publicly available data related to genomic annotation for L. braziliensis. This updated information can be useful for future genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics studies; being an additional tool for genome annotation pipelines and novel studies associated with the understanding of this protozoan genome complexity, organization, biology, and development of innovative methodologies for disease control and diagnostics.",LeishDB: a database of coding gene annotation and non-coding RNAs in Leishmania braziliensis,"Torres, F., Arias-Carrasco, R., Caris-Maldonado, J.C., Barral, A., Maracaja-Coutinho, V., De Queiroz, A.T.L.",2017,DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION,,,bax047,,,11,13,10.1093/database/bax047,,"[Torres, Felipe; Barral, Aldina; De Queiroz, Artur T.

"They mention this: Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) included human cases of leptospirosis in its Regional Core Health Data Initiative, an open-access database",Yes,"Objectives. To demonstrate the importance of country surveillance systems for leptospirosis and their use for preliminary epidemiological analysis, as well as to generate research questions for future, more comprehensive studies on the disease. Methods. In 2015, for the first time, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) included human cases of leptospirosis in its Regional Core Health Data Initiative, an open-access database that collects annual health indicators from the countries and territories of the Americas. This new information was used to analyze leptospirosis cases by country and sex and to calculate cumulative incidence rates. Maps were used to help present the results. To supplement that general review of leptospirosis in the Americas, more detailed descriptions of the epidemiological situation and the surveillance programs of four selected countries (Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, and Honduras) were provided. Results. In this first year of PAHO requesting leptospirosis data, of the 49 countries and territories in the Americas, 38 of them (77.6%) reported information. Among those 38, 28 of them (73.7%) reported the presence of human cases; the majority of instances of zero cases were in Caribbean territories. From those 28, a total of 10 702 human cases were recorded. The largest numbers of cases in Latin America were in Brazil (40.2%), Peru (23.6%), Colombia (8.8%), and Ecuador (7.2%). The cumulative incidence rate for Latin America was estimated to be 2.0 per 100 000 population. On average, 65.1% of cases were males. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that many countries in Latin America are making efforts to establish strong surveillance systems and programs for leptospirosis.

"Data sharing statement
The data that support the findings of this study are publicly available, and can be reached as they are referenced in this study, especially references number: 1, 6-9, 11, 12, 13, 15-17, 28, and 29.",Yes,"Background The Radiotherapy Expansion Plan for Brazil's Unified Health System (PER-SUS) was an innovative program designed by the Ministry of Health in 2012 to provide improvements to the challenging problem of access to radiotherapy in the country. This study sought to analyze the execution and implementation of installations proposed by PER-SUS, and their capacity to address the problems of radiotherapy access in Brazil. Methods From the first release (February 2015) until October 2021, all PER-SUS monthly progress reports were retrospectively analyzed. The beneficiary institutions, project location, project status, project type, dates of the progress on the stages, and reasons for cancellations or possible justifications for changing the status were collected. Brazilian geographic data, health care demands, and cancer incidences were correlated. Finally, we performed an Ishikawa diagram and 5W3H methodology, aiming to better understand the findings and to yield possible ways to improve the access to radiotherapy. Findings After ten years, the PER-SUS project delivered nearly 50% of the planned implementation of radiotherapy equipment. There was a 17% growth in the national number of linear accelerators (LINACS) with PER-SUS, against a 32% increase in cancer incidence in Brazil in the same period. The following points were identified: a high rate of beneficiary exclusions reflecting inappropriate selection or inadequate planning; delays in execution related to bureaucratic obstacles and underestimation of the requirements (logistics/people); early closing of the equipment factory as a result of lack of project prioritization by the Government. Interpretation Only about 50% of PER-SUS are being carried out. However, delays and exclusions of beneficiaries were observed. The dimension of the need for radiotherapy care in Brazil is greater than considered, and might not be fully attended by PER-SUS. Geographic, epidemiological, logistical, and economic variables could be reevaluated to allow better strategic planning and improvement proposals. PER-SUS could be optimized for the next decade, by involving all stakeholders' participation, alignment, and engagement. In the future, the States and regions with a higher LINAC shortage should be prioritized to improve RT access across the country. Considering the data and the initial project deadline, PER-SUS did not achieve the pre-established goals specified by the Brazilian Government. Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Values for indicators of access barriers for forgone care were generated using available datasets and reports from the countries. Results were disaggregated by wealth quintiles according to income or asset-based wealth levels. Results. Most surveys were similar in general approach and in the categories of their content. However, country-specific questionnaires varied by country, which hindered cross-country comparisons. On average, about one-Third of people experienced multiple barriers to forgone appropriate care. There was great variability between countries in the experience of these barriers, although disparities were relatively consistent across countries. People in the poorest wealth quintile were more likely to experience barriers related to acceptability issues, financial and geographic access, and availability of resources. Conclusions. The analysis indicates major inequalities by wealth status and uneven progress in multiple access barriers that hinder progress towards the goals of equity as part of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health in the Americas. Access barriers were multiple, which highlights the need for integrated and multisectoral approaches to tackle them. Given the variability between instruments across countries, future efforts are needed to standardize questionnaires and improve data quality and availability for regional monitoring of access barriers. © 2020 Pan American Health Organization.

"NEURO-TTR is a dataset with patients from all around the world, but you can't know which ones are from south america",No,"Background Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR/ATTRv) results from the deposition of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) throughout the body, including peripheral nerves. Inotersen, an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of hepatic TTR production, demonstrated a favorable efficacy and safety profile in patients with the polyneuropathy associated with hATTR in the NEURO-TTR (NCT01737398) study. We report longer-term efficacy and safety data for inotersen, with a median treatment exposure of 3 years. Methods Patients who satisfactorily completed NEURO-TTR were enrolled in its open-label extension (OLE) study. Efficacy assessments included the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 (mNIS + 7), Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) questionnaire total score, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36v2) Health Survey Physical Component Summary score. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Efficacy is reported for patients living in Europe and North America (this cohort completed the study approximately 9 months before the remaining group of patients outside these regions); safety is reported for the full safety dataset, comprising patients living in Europe, North America, and Latin America/Australasia. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02175004. Results In the Europe and North America cohort of the NEURO-TTR study, 113/141 patients (80.1%) completed the study, and 109 patients participated in the OLE study. A total of 70 patients continued to receive inotersen (inotersen-inotersen) and 39 switched from placebo to inotersen (placebo-inotersen). The placebo-inotersen group demonstrated sustained improvement in neurological disease progression as measured by mNIS + 7, compared with predicted worsening based on projection of the NEURO-TTR placebo data (estimated natural history). The inotersen-inotersen group demonstrated sustained benefit, as measured by mNIS + 7, Norfolk QoL-DN, and SF-36v2, compared with estimated natural history as well as compared with the placebo-inotersen group. With a maximum exposure of 6.2 years, inotersen was not associated with any additional safety concerns or increased toxicity in the OLE study. Platelet and renal monitoring were effective in reducing the risk of severe adverse events in the OLE study. Conclusion Inotersen treatment for > 3 years slowed progression of the polyneuropathy associated with hATTR, and no new safety signals were observed.",Long-term efficacy and safety of inotersen for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis: NEURO-TTR open-label extension 3-year update,"Brannagan, T.H., Coelho, T., Wang, A.K., Polydefkis, M.J., Dyck, P.J., Berk, J.L., Drachman, B., Gorevic, P., Whelan, C., Conceicao, I., Plante-Bordeneuve, V., Merlini, G., Obici, L., Plana, J.M.C., Gamez, J., Kristen, A.V., Mazzeo, A., Gentile, L., Narayana, A., Olugemo, K., Aquino, P., Benson, M.D., Gertz, M.",2022,JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY,269,12,,6416,6427,12,2,10.1007/s00415-022-11276-8,,"[Brannagan, Thomas H.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurol, Med Ctr, 710 West 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Coelho, Teresa] Ctr Hosp Univ Porto, Porto, Portugal; [Wang, Annabel K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Neuromuscular Diagnost Lab, Orange, CA USA; [Polydefkis, Michael J.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Dyck, Peter J.; Gertz, Morie] Mayo Clin, Neurol & Gen Internal Med, Rochester, MN USA; [Berk, John L.] Boston Univ, Amyloid Clin, Boston, MA USA; [Drachman, Brian] Penn Presbyterian Med Ctr, Cardiovasc Med, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Gorevic, Peter] Mt Sinai Med Ctr, Dept Rheumatol, New York, NY USA; [Whelan, Carol] Royal Free Hosp, Natl Amyloidosis Ctr, Cardiol, London, England; [Conceicao, Isabel] Univ Lisbon, Hosp Santa Maria, Dept Neurol, CHULN, Lisbon, Portugal; [Conceicao, Isabel] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Lisbon, Portugal; [Plante-Bordeneuve, Violaine] CHU Henri Mondor, Creteil, France; [Merlini, Giampaolo; Obici, Laura] Univ Pavia, IRCCS Fdn Policlin San Matteo, Amyloidosis Res & Treatment Ctr, Pavia, Italy; [Campistol Plana, Josep Maria] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, Inst dInvestigac Biomed August Pi I Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain; [Gamez, Josep] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Neurol Dept, GMA Clin, Barcelona, Spain; [Gamez, Josep] European Reference Network Rare Neuromuscular Dis, Barcelona, Spain; [Kristen, Arnt, V] Heidelberg Univ Hosp, Amyloidosis Ctr, Heidelberg, Germany; [Mazzeo, Anna; Gentile, Luca] Univ Messina, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Messina, Italy; [Narayana, Arvind; Olugemo, Kemi; Aquino, Peter] Akcea Therapeut, Boston, MA USA; [Benson, Merrill D.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Indianapolis, IN USA",,Clinical trial; Familial amyloid polyneuropathy; Inotersen; Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis; Peripheral neuropathies; Polyneuropathy,DIAGNOSIS; THAOS,Clinical trial;Familial amyloid polyneuropathy;Inotersen;Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis;Peripheral neuropathies;Polyneuropathy;DIAGNOSIS;THAOS,tb2325@cumc.columbia.edu,,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",,,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,0340-5354,,,35908242,English,J NEUROL,Article,WoS,Neurosciences & Neurology,WOS:000833988500001,2-s2.0-85135338332,United States;Portugal;United Kingdom;France;Italy;Spain;Germany,cumc.columbia.edu,Columbia Univ;Ctr Hosp Univ Porto;Univ Calif Irvine;Johns Hopkins Univ;Mayo Clin;Boston Univ;Penn Presbyterian Med Ctr;Mt Sinai Med Ctr;Royal Free Hosp;Univ Lisbon;CHU Henri Mondor;Univ Pavia;Univ Barcelona;Autonomous Univ Barcelona;European Reference Network Rare Neuromuscular Dis;Heidelberg Univ Hosp;Univ Messina;Akcea Therapeut;Indiana Univ Sch Med,"Columbia Univ, United States;Ctr Hosp Univ Porto, Portugal;Univ Calif Irvine, United States;Johns Hopkins Univ, United States;Mayo Clin, United States;Boston Univ, United States;Penn Presbyterian Med Ctr, United States;Mt Sinai Med Ctr, United States;Royal Free Hosp, United Kingdom;Univ Lisbon, Portugal;CHU Henri Mondor, France;Univ Pavia, Italy;Univ Barcelona, Spain;Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Spain;European Reference Network Rare Neuromuscular Dis, Spain;Heidelberg Univ Hosp, Germany;Univ Messina, Italy;Akcea Therapeut, United States;Indiana Univ Sch Med, United States","Brannagan, Thomas H.; Coelho, Teresa; Wang, Annabel K.; Polydefkis, Michael J.; Dyck, Peter J.; Berk, John L.; Drachman, Brian; Gorevic, Peter; Whelan, Carol; Conceicao, Isabel; Plante-Bordeneuve, Violaine; Merlini, Giampaolo; Obici, Laura; Campistol Plana, Josep Maria; Gamez, Josep; Kristen, Arnt, V; Mazzeo, Anna; Gentile, Luca; Narayana, Arvind; Olugemo, Kemi; Aquino, Peter; Benson, Merrill D.; Gertz, Morie",,
"I don't know how related is with health, anyway they don't mention the data sources",No,"One of the main environmental problems that affects people’s health and quality of life is air pollution by particulate matter. Chile has nine of the ten most polluted cities in South America according to a report presented in 2019 by Greenpeace and AirVisual that measured the air quality index based on the levels of fine particles. Most Chilean cities are highly contaminated by particulate matter, especially during the months of April to August (the critical episode management period). The objective of this study is to predict particulate matter levels based on meteorological and climatic features, such as temperature, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation and relative air humidity in Talca, Chile, during the critical episode management periods between 2014 and 2018. Predictive models based on machine learning techniques were used, considering training datasets with meteorological and climatic data, and particulate matter levels from the three air quality monitoring stations in Talca, Chile. We carried out the training of 24 models to predict particulate matter levels considering the 24-h average and average between 05:00 to 11:00 p.m. For the model testing, data from the year 2018 during the critical episode management period were used. The obtained results indicate that our models are able to effectively predict levels of particulate matter, enabling correct management of critical episodes, especially for alert, pre-emergency and emergency conditions. We used the cross-platform and open-source programming language Python for the development and implementation of the proposed models and R-project for some visualizations. © 2022 by the authors.

Is about Macrophytes XD,No,"River damming for electric power production generally triggers a set of anthropic activities that strongly impact on aquatic ecosystem, especially in small reservoirs located in urbanized and industrialized areas. Among the possible adverse effects is the over-abundance of aquatic macrophytes resulting from the input of high concentration of nutrients in the ecosystem that can affect the health of the ecosystem. In these situations, macrophytes are treated as weeds that need to be continuously monitored and analysed over time. Historically, remote sensing has played a prominent role in change detection studies and, nowadays, considering the open data sources of multi-temporal images and the high computational performance that allows for larger volumes of historical images to be mined, water monitoring is a recurrent object of analysis. The Salto Grande reservoir is a small water body located in the metropolitan region of Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil, characterized by high rates of urbanization and industrialization. The intense anthropic occupation around the reservoir triggered the degradation of the landscape and the decrease of water quality. This study explored the potential of image-attributes’ time series to monitor the spatio-temporal behavior of aquatic macrophytes in the Salto Grande Reservoir. Our assumption was that the combination of techniques for analyzing large multi-temporal datasets enables us to understand the trends and changes in the macrophytes occurrence in this small reservoir. To achieve this, quarterly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series based on Landsat data imagery from 1984 to 2017 were built to analyze the occurrence and persistence of these aquatic plants in the reservoir. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the NDVI time series, which allowed us to identify typical years in the abundance of macrophytes and twelve regions of greater and lesser temporal variability in its abundance, by a K-means aggregation of the first principal component scores. For these regions, the Breaks for Additive and Seasonality Trend (BFAST) algorithm was used to analyze the trend, cyclic behaviour, and changes in the time series of the average NDVI. BFAST was able to detect gradual and abrupt changes for each of the twelve areas by searching for breakpoints in the temporal series. It was observed that the regions near the dam and where the conditions of the river are still maintained are most affected by the occurrence of macrophytes, characterized by an average NDVI greater than 0.4. Although subject to more subtle seasonal variations, all these regions defined at least one breakpoint, suggesting abrupt changes such as sharp interventions to control the overabundance of macrophytes at specific time. The regions located in the middle of the reservoir, with a more lacustrine influence, had lower average NDVI and small variations over time. Thus, it was possible to identify the critical regions of the studied reservoir with excess of growing macrophytes through the applied method, which also can be applied to similar areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Macrophytes’ abundance changes in eutrophicated tropical reservoirs exemplified by Salto Grande (Brazil): Trends and temporal analysis exploiting Landsat remotely sensed data,"Coladello L.F., de Lourdes Bueno Trindade Galo M., Shimabukuro M.H., Ivanova I., Awange J.",2020,Applied Geography,121,,102242,,,,6,10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102242,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086586959&doi=10.1016%2fj.apgeog.2020.102242&partnerID=40&md5=bf286b8cda9585e8b6fdde6218e7b764,"School of Technology and Sciences, São Paulo State University (Unesp), Presidente Prudente, SP, Brazil; School of Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS), Curtin University, Perth, Australia; Geodetic Institute, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Engler-Strasse 7, Karlsruhe, D-76131, Germany","Coladello, L.F., School of Technology and Sciences, São Paulo State University (Unesp), Presidente Prudente, SP, Brazil; de Lourdes Bueno Trindade Galo, M., School of Technology and Sciences, São Paulo State University (Unesp), Presidente Prudente, SP, Brazil; Shimabukuro, M.H., School of Technology and Sciences, São Paulo State University (Unesp), Presidente Prudente, SP, Brazil; Ivánová, I., School of Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS), Curtin University, Perth, Australia; Awange, J., School of Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS), Curtin University, Perth, Australia, Geodetic Institute, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Engler-Strasse 7, Karlsruhe, D-76131, Germany",Abrupt changes; BFAST; Macrophytes; NDVI time Series; Reservoir; Seasonality,eutrophication; image analysis; Landsat; macrophyte; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; temporal analysis; Brazil; Campinas; Salto Grande Reservoir; Sao Paulo [Brazil],Abrupt changes;BFAST;Macrophytes;NDVI time Series;Reservoir;Seasonality;eutrophication;image analysis;Landsat;macrophyte;remote sensing;satellite data;satellite imagery;temporal analysis;Brazil;Campinas;Salto Grande Reservoir;Sao Paulo [Brazil],"Coladello, L.F.; School of Technology and Sciences, Brazil; email: leandro.f.coladello@unesp.br",,,,,,Elsevier Ltd,1436228,,,,English,Appl.

This is about a course,No,"With syphilis cases on the rise, Brazil declared an epidemic in 2016. To address the consequent public health crisis, the Ministry of Health laid out a rapid response plan, namely, the “Syphilis No!” Project (SNP), a national instrument to fight the disease which encompasses four dimensions: (a) management and governance, (b) surveillance, (c) comprehensive care, and (d) strengthening of educommunication. In the dimension of education, the SNP developed the learning pathway “Syphilis and other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)” to strengthen and promote Health Education. This pathway features 54 Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), delivered through the Virtual Learning Environment of the Brazilian Health System (AVASUS). This paper analyzes the impacts of the learning pathway “Syphilis and other STIs” on the response to the epidemic in Brazil, highlighting the educational process of the learning pathway and its social implications from the perspective of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals. Three distinct databases were used to organize the educational data: the learning pathway “Syphilis and other STIs” from AVASUS, the National Registry of HealthCare Facilities from the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH), and the Brazilian Occupation Classification, from the Ministry of Labor. The analysis provides a comprehensive description of the 54 courses of the learning pathway, which has 177,732 enrollments and 93,617 participants from all Brazilian regions, especially the Southeast, which accounts for the highest number of enrollees. Additionally, it is worth noting that students living abroad also enrolled in the courses. Data characterization provided a demographic study focused on the course participants' profession and level of care practiced, revealing that the majority (85%) worked in primary and secondary healthcare. These practitioners are the target audience of the learning pathway and, accordingly, are part of the personnel directly engaged in healthcare services that fight the syphilis epidemic in Brazil.

This is in animals,No,"Background: This is a first description of the main ethnoveterinary features of the peasants in the Sierras de Cordoba. The aim of this study was to analyze the use of medicinal plants and other traditional therapeutic practices for healing domestic animals and cattle. Our particular goals were to: characterize veterinary ethnobotanical knowledge considering age, gender and role of the specialists; interpret the cultural features of the traditional local veterinary medicine and plant uses associated to it; compare the plants used in traditional veterinary medicine, with those used in human medicine in the same region. Methods: Fieldwork was carried out as part of an ethnobotanic regional study where 64 informants were interviewed regarding medicinal plants used in veterinary medicine throughout 2001-2010. Based participant observation and open and semi-structured interviews we obtained information on the traditional practices of diagnosis and healing, focusing on the veterinary uses given to plants (part of the plant used, method of preparation and administration). Plants speciemens were collected with the informants and their vernacular and scientific names were registered in a database. Non-parametric statistic was used to evaluate differences in medicinal plant knowledge, use, and valorization by local people. A comparison between traditional veterinary medicine and previous human medicine studies developed in the region was performed by analyzing the percentages of common species and uses, and by considering Sorensen's Similarity Index. Results: A total of 127 medicinal uses were registered, corresponding to 70 species of plants belonging to 39 botanic families. Veterinary ethnobotanical knowledge was specialized, restricted, in general, to cattle breeders (mainly men) and to a less degree to healers, and was independent of the age of the interviewees. Native plants were mostly used as skin cicatrizants, disinfectants or for treating digestive disorders. Together with a vast repertoire of plant pharmacopoeia, the therapies also involve religious or ritualistic practices and other popular remedies that evidence the influence of traditional Hispanic-European knowledge. Although the traditional veterinary knowledge seems to be similar or else is inlcuded in the local human ethnomedicine, sharing a common group of plants, it has distinct traits originated by a constant assessment of new applications specifically destined to the treatment of animals. Conclusions: Veterinary medicine is a fountain of relevant vernacular knowledge, a permanent source for testing new applications with valuable ethnobotanical interest.

a quantitative analysis based on secondary data collected from different open databases,Yes,"This descriptive study sought to analyze the mental health status of 48 Northeastern municipalities in Brazil with quilombola communities and agrarian reform settlements in their territories, considering the living conditions, health service supply and the profile of morbidity and mortality in mental health. Gender, class and race aspects are articulated to understand the production of health inequities in these territories. By means of a quantitative analysis based on secondary data collected from different open databases, the research unveiled the intersection and combination of factors that influence the mental health status of municipalities with rural and forest populations: the precariousness of living and working conditions, insufficient support from psychosocial care services, and ethnic-racial and gender inequalities in psychiatric morbidity and mortality. © 2022, Associacao Universitaria de Pesquisa em Psicopatologia Fundamental.

They created a metadata for public health data in brasil,Yes,"The Brazilian government and the founders of the Open Government Partnership adopted in 2011 the Declaration of Open Government, announcing action plans to make datasets accessible according with the eight principles of Open Government Data, which resulted in the implementation of the ""Portal Brasileiro de Dados Abertos"". Through an information retrieval system, the users can search datasets about health, transportation, public safety, education, government spending and electoral process. Share government data in Web can become a complex activity and the low semantic level of this type of information can causes problems during the search like superficial access and dificult undertanding of datasets. An Efficient description of information resources and an appropriate representation of the datasets can mitigate these problems and contribute to achieving relevant results in the retrieval process. This research brings the question about which elements of metadata are using by government services to represent its information resources.

This is in Costa Rica,No,"As in most immigrant-receiving countries in the global North, countries in the South face challenges regarding migrant access to social rights and the effect of migrants on the sustainability of the welfare state. In the Latin American context, this holds especially for countries such as Costa Rica, which has one of the strongest social policy regimes in the South and the highest (Nicaraguan) immigrant stock in Latin America. Set in the context of Costa Rica, this paper assesses two views which seem hard to reconcile, and, are common in the country. First, it is claimed that Nicaraguan migrants use public health services disproportionately, thereby threatening the country's welfare system. Second, pro-migrant rights non-governmental organizations and academics are concerned, primarily based on qualitative studies, that access to health services for Nicaraguan immigrants is limited, and that they are discriminated based on nationality. This paper relies on administrative data and a unique data set representative of Nicaraguan born individuals residing in Costa Rica to examine the validity of both these claims. We do not find support for either. The incidence of migrant health care use is lower than their share in the population and at the same time there is no evidence of discrimination in health care access for migrants based on their nationality. The paper underlines the need for more informed migration debates. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Using databases, newspaper columns, government websites, and legislation, we outline the region’s travel restrictions and exceptions, closures and militarization of borders, internal movement procedures, and economic subsidies to ease Covid-19’s impact",Yes,"During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, (im)mobility policies affected individuals’ citizenship rights and movement within countries and across international borders. Prior to the pandemic, the mobility regime in South America was relatively open for regional migrants, bolstered on free residence and equal rights. In this analysis, we focus on human mobility and citizenship rights in South America by examining local and national government responses to Covid-19 between March and August 2020. Using databases, newspaper columns, government websites, and legislation, we outline the region’s travel restrictions and exceptions, closures and militarization of borders, internal movement procedures, and economic subsidies to ease Covid-19’s impact. While the regional mobility regime had already been under stress since 2015, exceptions to border closures and internal mobility further stratified people based on legal and economic statuses. Deeply affecting individual-state relations, access to mobility and citizenship rights such as labor, housing, and healthcare varied between nationals and non-nationals and between regular and irregular migrants. Reactions may have longer term effects, especially for Venezuelans, since the crisis created new inequalities and contradictions within the regional mobility regime, originally aimed at reducing them.

time series of data extracted from operational earth observation satellite images using MODIS satellite,Yes,"Mosquitoes are vectors of many human diseases. In particular, Aedes ægypti (Linnaeus) is the main vector for Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses in Latin America and it represents a global threat. Public health policies that aim at combating this vector require dependable and timely information, which is usually expensive to obtain with field campaigns. For this reason, several efforts have been done to use remote sensing due to its reduced cost. The present work includes the temporal modeling of the oviposition activity (measured weekly on 50 ovitraps in a north Argentinean city) of Aedes ægypti (Linnaeus), based on time series of data extracted from operational earth observation satellite images. We use are NDVI, NDWI, LST night, LST day and TRMM-GPM rain from 2012 to 2016 as predictive variables. In contrast to previous works which use linear models, we employ Machine Learning techniques using completely accessible open source toolkits. These models have the advantages of being non-parametric and capable of describing nonlinear relationships between variables. Specifically, in addition to two linear approaches, we assess a support vector machine, an artificial neural networks, a K-nearest neighbors and a decision tree regressor. Considerations are made on parameter tuning and the validation and training approach. The results are compared to linear models used in previous works with similar data sets for generating temporal predictive models. These new tools perform better than linear approaches, in particular nearest neighbor regression (KNNR) performs the best. These results provide better alternatives to be implemented operatively on the Argentine geospatial risk system that is running since 2012. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Modeling Dengue vector population using remotely sensed data and machine learning,"Scavuzzo J.M., Trucco F., Espinosa M., Tauro C.B., Abril M., Scavuzzo C.M., Frery A.C.",2018,Acta Tropica,185,,,167,175,,64,10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.05.003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047244084&doi=10.1016%2fj.actatropica.2018.05.003&partnerID=40&md5=2802404014cbc987e8579b2d3da8edf0,"Facultad de Maremática, Atronomía, Física y Computación, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Argentina; Instituto de Altos Estudios Espaciales Mario Gulich, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba-Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales, Argentina; Fundación Mundo Sano, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Universidade Federal de Alagoas, Brazil","Scavuzzo, J.M., Facultad de Maremática, Atronomía, Física y Computación, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Argentina; Trucco, F., Facultad de Maremática, Atronomía, Física y Computación, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Argentina; Espinosa, M., Fundación Mundo Sano, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Tauro, C.B., Instituto de Altos Estudios Espaciales Mario Gulich, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba-Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales, Argentina; Abril, M., Fundación Mundo Sano, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Scavuzzo, C.M., Instituto de Altos Estudios Espaciales Mario Gulich, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba-Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales, Argentina; Frery, A.C., Universidade Federal de Alagoas, Brazil",Aedes ægypti (Linnaeus); Dengue population; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Time series,"virus vector; dengue fever; machine learning; modeling; remote sensing; satellite imagery; time series; Aedes aegypti; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; city; decision tree; dengue; machine learning; nonhuman; predictor variable; remote sensing; software; statistical model; support vector machine; training; validation study; Aedes; animal; biological model; dengue; egg laying; female; human; mosquito vector; physiology; procedures; remote sensing; transmission; Latin America; Zika virus; Aedes; Animals; Dengue; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Biological; Mosquito Vectors; Oviposition; Remote Sensing Technology","Aedes ægypti (Linnaeus);Dengue population;Machine learning;Remote sensing;Time series;virus vector;dengue fever;modeling;satellite imagery;Aedes aegypti;algorithm;Article;artificial neural network;city;decision tree;dengue;nonhuman;predictor variable;software;statistical model;support vector machine;training;validation study;Aedes;animal;biological model;egg laying;female;human;mosquito vector;physiology;procedures;transmission;Latin America;Zika virus;Animals;Humans;Models, Biological;Mosquito Vectors;Oviposition;Remote Sensing Technology","Scavuzzo, C.M.; Instituto de Altos Estudios Espaciales Mario Gulich, Argentina; email: scavuzzocm@gmail.com",,,,,,Elsevier B.V.,0001706X,,ACTRA,29777650,English,Acta Trop.,Article,Scopus,,2-s2.0-85047244084,,Argentina;Brazil,gmail.com,,,"Scavuzzo J.M., Trucco F., Espinosa M., Tauro C.B., Abril M., Scavuzzo C.M., Frery A.C.",,
Not human related,No,"Author summary The Pan American Health Organisation's Strategy and Plan of Action for Chagas Disease Prevention, Control and Care highlights the importance of eliminating those triatomine vector species that colonise homes, and has had great success in many locations. Since indoor residual spraying campaigns have targeted these species, their importance relative to other vectors has diminished and their geographical distributions may also have changed. It is now vital to consider the full community of vector species, including previously dominant vectors as well as secondary or minor vector species, in order to target residual transmission to humans. Our aim was to define the geographical distributions of the most commonly reported triatomine species in the Chagas endemic region from northern Argentina and Chile to the southern United States of America. We extracted reports of triatomine vector species observed at specific locations from a public database and we used a geostatistical model to generate fine-scale predictive maps for thirty triatomine vector species. Data quality and data availability issues necessitate careful interpretation of the results, so (un)certainty intervals are presented alongside each map. We also present these maps alongside a summary of the published evidence for key indicators related to the capacity of each species to transmit the Chagas parasite to humans. This evidence shows that most of the 30 species that we have mapped pose a potential threat to human populations. Approximately 150 triatomine species are suspected to be infected with the Chagas parasite,Trypanosoma cruzi, but they differ in the risk they pose to human populations. The largest risk comes from species that have a domestic life cycle and these species have been targeted by indoor residual spraying campaigns, which have been successful in many locations. It is now important to consider residual transmission that may be linked to persistent populations of dominant vectors, or to secondary or minor vectors. The aim of this project was to define the geographical distributions of the community of triatomine species across the Chagas endemic region. Presence-only data with over 12, 000 observations of triatomine vectors were extracted from a public database and target-group background data were generated to account for sampling bias in the presence data. Geostatistical regression was then applied to estimate species distributions and fine-scale distribution maps were generated for thirty triatomine vector species including those found within one or two countries and species that are more widely distributed from northern Argentina to Guatemala, Bolivia to southern Mexico, and Mexico to the southern United States of America. The results forRhodnius pictipes,Panstrongylus geniculatus,Triatoma dimidiata,Triatoma gerstaeckeri, andTriatoma infestansare presented in detail, including model predictions and (un)certainty in these predictions, and the model validation results for each of the 30 species are presented in full. The predictive maps for all species are made publicly available so that they can be used to assess the communities of vectors present within different regions of the endemic zone. The maps are presented alongside key indicators for the capacity of each species to transmitT. cruzito humans. These indicators include infection prevalence, evidence for human blood meals, and colonisation or invasion of homes. A summary of the published evidence for these indicators shows that the majority of the 30 species mapped by this study have the potential to transmitT. cruzito humans.",Modelling geospatial distributions of the triatomine vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi in Latin America,"Bender, A., Python, A., Lindsay, S.W., Golding, N., Moyes, C.L.",2020,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,14,8,e0008411,,,19,12,10.1371/journal.pntd.0008411,,"[Bender, Andreas; Python, Andre; Moyes, Catherine L.] Univ Oxford, Li Ka Shing Ctr Hlth Informat & Discovery, Big Data Inst, Old Rd Campus, Oxford, England; [Lindsay, Steve W.] Univ Durham, Dept Biosci, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Golding, Nick] Univ Melbourne, Dept BioSci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,,POINT PROCESS MODELS; HEMIPTERA REDUVIIDAE; CHAGAS-DISEASE; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; EVENTS; TRANSMISSION; ACCURACY; HABITAT; STAL; BIAS,POINT PROCESS MODELS;HEMIPTERA REDUVIIDAE;CHAGAS-DISEASE;SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION;EVENTS;TRANSMISSION;ACCURACY;HABITAT;STAL;BIAS,bender.at.research@gmail.com; catherinemoyes@gmail.com,,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",,,,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,1935-2735,,,32776929,English,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Article,WoS,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,WOS:000561393300002,,United Kingdom;Australia,gmail.com,Univ Oxford;Univ Durham;Univ Melbourne,"Univ Oxford, United Kingdom;Univ Durham, United Kingdom;Univ Melbourne, Australia","Bender, Andreas; Python, Andre; Lindsay, Steve W.; Golding, Nick; Moyes, Catherine L.",,
Software,No,"E-learning has become an excellent alternative for those who want to align studies, professional qualification, and career. Several courses offered in this modality use the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) known as Moodle to support the process of teaching and learning. However, some managerial needs are not optimized in this VLE, especially regarding the administration of students and tutors information. Because of this, the monitoring process carried out by the work teams in the educational institutions might become expensive and time-consuming. Although the data is in a single database in Moodle, it is not a practical activity retrieving the information. Therefore, in face of this reality, the Open University of Brazilian National Health System in partnership with the Federal University of Maranhao (UNA-SUS/UFMA) and other higher education institutions developed the Monitoring System, a tool that makes easier the decision-making and the didactic strategies elaboration using data from Moodle. This paper aims to present the Monitoring System, that enabled data management in a faster and online way, requiring less effort of the monitoring team to generate useful information for a satisfactory course control and progress, resulting in a significant reduction in the time spent by UNA-SUS/UFMA monitoring team to manage students and tutors data",Monitoring System to Help an e-Learning Institution to Manage Tutors and Student Data Retrieved from Moodle,"Monier, E., Gatinho, F., Oliveira, A.E., Rabelo, A., Martins, R.",2017,25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION (ICCE 2017): TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION: COMPUTER-BASED EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY,,,,490,492,3,0,,,"[Monier, Elza; Gatinho, Fatima; Oliveira, Ana Emilia; Rabelo, Aldrea; Martins, Romulo] Univ Fed Maranhao, UNA SUS, Sao Luis, Brazil",,Virtual learning environment; Moodle; Monitoring System,,Virtual learning environment;Moodle;Monitoring System,bernardes.elza@gmail.com,"Chen, W; Yang, JC; Ayub, AFM; Wong, SL; Mitrovic, A","NO 300, JUNGDA RD, JHONGLI DISTRICT, TAOYUAN CITY, 320, TAIWAN",25th International Conference on Computers in Education (ICCE) - Technology and Innovation - Computer-Based Educational Systems for the 21st Century,"Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","DEC 04-08, 2017",ASIA PACIFIC SOC COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION,,978-986-94012-6-5,,,English,,Proceedings Paper,WoS,Computer Science; Education & Educational Research,WOS:000431848700080,2-s2.0-85053892968,Brazil,gmail.com,Univ Fed Maranhao,"Univ Fed Maranhao, Brazil","Monier, Elza; Gatinho, Fatima; Oliveira, Ana Emilia; Rabelo, Aldrea; Martins, Romulo",,
Is in Columbia,No,"Background: The BC Harm Reduction Strategies and Services (HRSS) policy states that each health authority (HA) and their community partners will provide a full range of harm reduction (HR) services to their jurisdictions and these HR products should be available to all who need them regardless of where they live and choice of drug. Preliminary analysis revealed wide variations between and within HAs. Methods: The objective of this study is to analyze distribution of HR products by site using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and to investigate the range, adequacy and methods of HR product distribution using qualitative interviews. The BC Centre for Disease Control pharmacy database tracks HR supplies distributed to health units and community agencies. Additionally, eleven face-to-face interviews were conducted in eight mainland BC communities using an open-ended questionnaire. Results: There is evidence in BC that HR supplies are not equally available throughout the province. There are variations within jurisdictions in how HR supplies are distributed, adequacy of current HR products, collection of used needles, alternative uses of supplies and community attitudes towards HR. GIS illustrates where HR supplies are ordered but with secondary distribution, true reach and availability of supplies cannot be determined. Conclusion: Currently, a consultant is employed to develop a 'best practice' document; relevant health files, standard training and protocols within HAs are also being developed. There is a need to enhance the profile and availability of culturally appropriate HR services for Aboriginal populations.

,No,"Postoperative mortality is a rare event after bariatric surgery. The main goal of this study was to calculate the 30-day mortality rate postbariatric ""open"" surgery and the length of hospital stay of patients assisted by a health maintenance organization in Brazil. We also investigate their association with sex, age, BMI, preexisting comorbidities, and volume of procedures performed by surgeons. A total of 2,167 patients who underwent RYGB between 01/2004 and 12/2007 were analyzed. The deaths and hospital stay were identified in the healthcare transactional database and the morbidity data in the preoperative medical audit records. Factors contributing to adverse outcomes were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis. The overall mortality rate was 0.64%, with a decreasing trend over the years. The median hospital stay was 3.1 days. In the multivariate analysis, both mortality and longer hospital stay were positively and significantly associated with age > 50 years, BMI > 50 kg/m(2), and surgeon volume of less than 20 bariatric surgeries/year. Presence of hypertension also increased the risk of longer hospital stay. Multivariate analysis showed that the 30-day mortality was six times higher in patients operated by professionals who performed less surgeries/year and longer hospital stay, four times more frequent. The 30-day mortality post-RYGB is similar to the rates found in developed countries and much lower than the rates found for patients assisted by the public health system in Brazil. In addition to age and clinical factors, the results suggest that mortality and longer hospital stay are strong and inversely related to surgeon's experience.","Mortality and Hospital Stay After Bariatric Surgery in 2,167 Patients: Influence of the Surgeon Expertise","Kelles, S.M.B., Barreto, S.M., Guerra, H.L.",2009,OBESITY SURGERY,19,9,,1228,1235,8,31,10.1007/s11695-009-9894-7,,"[Bruschi Kelles, Silvana Marcia; Barreto, Sandhi Maria; Guerra, Henrique Leonardo] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Med, Program Postgrad Adults Hlth, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",,Morbid obesity; Morbidity; Mortality; Private health insurance; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; Hospital length stay; Surgeon's expertise; 30-Day cause of death,GASTRIC BYPASS-SURGERY; MORBIDLY OBESE-PATIENTS; LONG-TERM MORTALITY; SURGICAL-PROCEDURES; OUTCOMES; WEIGHT; METAANALYSIS; IMPROVEMENT; TRENDS; IMPACT,Morbid obesity;Morbidity;Mortality;Private health insurance;Roux-en-Y gastric bypass;Hospital length stay;Surgeon's expertise;30-Day cause of death;GASTRIC BYPASS-SURGERY;MORBIDLY OBESE-PATIENTS;LONG-TERM MORTALITY;SURGICAL-PROCEDURES;OUTCOMES;WEIGHT;METAANALYSIS;IMPROVEMENT;TRENDS;IMPACT,silvanakelles@terra.com.br,,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",,,,SPRINGER,0960-8923,,,19562422,English,OBES SURG,Article,WoS,Surgery,WOS:000269153200005,2-s2.0-69249221347,Brazil,terra.com.br,Univ Fed Minas Gerais,"Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Brazil","Bruschi Kelles, Silvana Marcia; Barreto, Sandhi Maria; Guerra, Henrique Leonardo",,
,No,"Background Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is being scaled up in developing countries. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes during the first year of HAART between HIV-1-infected patients in low-income and high-income settings. Methods 18 HAART programmes in Africa, Asia, and South America (low-income settings) and 12 HIV cohort studies from Europe and North America (high-income settings) provided data for 4810 and 22 217, respectively, treatment-naive adult patients starting HAART. All patients from high-income settings and 2725 (57%) patients from low-income settings were actively followed-up and included in survival analyses. Findings Compared with high-income countries, patients starting HAART in low-income settings had lower CD4 cell counts (median 108 cells per mu L vs 234 cells per mu L), were more likely to be female (51% vs 25%), and more likely to start treatment with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (70% vs 23%). At 6 months, the median number of CD4 cells gained (106 cells per mu L vs 103 cells per mu L) and the percentage of patients reaching HIV-1 RNA levels lower than 500 copies/mL (76% vs 77%) were similar. Mortality was higher in low-income settings (124 deaths during 2236 person-years of follow-up) than in high-income settings (414 deaths during 20 532 person-years). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of mortality comparing tow-income with high-income settings fell from 4.3 (95% CI 1.6-11.8) during the first month to 1.5 (0.7-3.0) during months 7-12. The provision of treatment free of charge in low-income settings was associated with lower mortality (adjusted HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.08-0.61). Interpretation Patients starting HAART in resource-poor settings have increased mortality rates in the first months on therapy, compared with those in developed countries.

Satellite Images and Census data,Yes,"BackgroundNutrition is one of the main factors affecting the development and quality of life of a person. From a public health perspective, food security is an essential social determinant for promoting healthy nutrition. Food security embraces four dimensions: physical availability of food, economic and physical access to food, food utilization, and the sustainability of the dimensions above. Integrally addressing the four dimensions is vital. Surprisingly most of the works focused on a single dimension of food security: the physical availability of food. ObjectiveThe paper proposes a multi-dimensional dataset of open data and satellite images to characterize food security in the department of Cauca, Colombia. MethodsThe food security dataset integrates multiple open data sources; therefore, the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining methodology was used to guide the construction of the dataset. It includes sources such as population and agricultural census, nutrition surveys, and satellite images. ResultsAn open multidimensional dataset for the Department of Cauca with 926 attributes and 9 rows (each row representing a Municipality) from multiple sources in Colombia, is configured. Then, machine learning models were used to characterize food security and nutrition in the Cauca Department. As a result, The Food security index calculated for Cauca using a linear regression model (Mean Absolute Error of 0.391) is 57.444 in a range between 0 and 100, with 100 the best score. Also, an approach for extracting four features (Agriculture, Habitation, Road, Water) of satellite images were tested with the ResNet50 model trained from scratch, having the best performance with a macro-accuracy, macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-F1-score of 91.7, 86.2, 66.91, and 74.92%, respectively. ConclusionIt shows how the CRISP-DM methodology can be used to create an open public health data repository. Furthermore, this methodology could be generalized to other types of problems requiring the creation of a dataset. In addition, the use of satellite images presents an alternative for places where data collection is challenging. The model and methodology proposed based on open data become a low-cost and effective solution that could be used by decision-makers, especially in developing countries, to support food security planning.",Multi-Dimensional Dataset of Open Data and Satellite Images for Characterization of Food Security and Nutrition,"Restrepo, D.S., Perez, L.E., Lopez, D.M., Vargas-Canas, R., Osorio-Valencia, J.S.",2022,FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION,8,,796082,,,13,3,10.3389/fnut.2021.796082,,"[Restrepo, David S.; Perez, Luis E.; Lopez, Diego M.] Univ Cauca, Telemat Dept, Telemat Engn Res Grp, Popayan, Colombia; [Vargas-Canas, Rubiel] Univ Cauca, Instrumentat & Control Res Grp, Dept Phys, Dynam Syst, Popayan, Colombia; [Osorio-Valencia, Juan Sebastian] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA USA",,data mining; food security; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; dataset,YIELD ESTIMATION,data mining;food security;machine learning;remote sensing;satellite imagery;dataset;YIELD ESTIMATION,dsrestrepo@unicauca.edu.co,,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,,,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,2296-861X,,,35155518,English,FRONT NUTR,Article,WoS,Nutrition & Dietetics,WOS:000753200400001,2-s2.0-85124527802,Colombia;United States,unicauca.edu.co,Univ Cauca;Univ Washington,"Univ Cauca, Colombia;Univ Washington, United States","Restrepo, David S.; Perez, Luis E.; Lopez, Diego M.; Vargas-Canas, Rubiel; Osorio-Valencia, Juan Sebastian",,
,No,"Introduction: The First Latin American Consensus on ADHD, held in June 2007, resulted that same year in the publication of a pharmacological treatment algorithm for adult ADHD. Methylphenidate (MPD) and atomoxetine were identified as first line medications for this age group. Following the Second Latin American Consensus on ADHD in Mendoza, Argentina, in October 2008, it was deemed necessary to complement the pharmacological algorithm with psychosocial treatment as part of the Latin American algorithms. In the combined and interdisciplinary ADHD treatments, stimulant and non-stimulant medications are used after the diagnostic evaluation, and these have proved effective reduction in the main symptoms of ADHD (attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsivity). However, these medications do not alter the dysfunctions of adults suffering from the disorder: poor academic performance, taking longer than the general population to complete professional studies, employment problems such as leaving jobs, dismissals and disciplinary procedures, poor handling of finances, conflicts with partners and family members, poor time management and performance of tasks etc. that lead to frustration, low self-esteem and feeling unable to cope. Psychosocial interventions, combined with medications, have proved effective in tackling these dysfunctions. In regard to pharmacological treatment, we reviewed the past five years' research into drug products approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA), stimulants and non-stimulants that have proved effective in reducing the main symptoms of adult ADHD, and bupropion/amfebutamone, fulfilling the purpose of this study, namely to summarize the scientific knowledge of adult ADHD and to create systematic guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults suffering from the disorder in Latin America. Method: A group was formed of six specialists in psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, neurology and clinical psychology from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico all members of the Latin American League for ADHD Research (LILAPETDAH). A review was carried out of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, OVID, Cochrane and PUB MED databases from 2003 to 2008 and a selection was made of English-language research articles on the diagnosis, prevalence, comorbidity, psychosocial impact, pharmacological and psychosocial treatment; in January 2009 tasks were apportioned and the summaries were completed in May 2009. In June 2009, the coordinator and a specialist in the group compiled the information into a final document, mainly using controlled studies, meta-analysis, etc. to propose the pharmacological treatment algorithm and psychosocial interventions for adult ADHD in 2009. Results: One topic discussed was the prevalence of ADHD in adults up until 2005. In order to find an estimate, longitudinal studies were carried out to follow up on children who suffered from the disorder until their adulthood, showing a 3.3-3.5% prevalence rate. Some investigators estimated the prevalence of adults with ADHD in a general population sample of the USA and reported a rate of 4.4%. In this sample, most cases went untreated and the only treatment received was for the comorbid psychiatric disorders including substance abuse. A recent metaanlasis over 100 publications from every continent, reported the combined ADHD rate of 5.29%. Variations between countries were mainly due to methodological reasons. The study of ten national surveys in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and the USA to investigate the prevalence of mental disorders, including adult ADHD, showed a global prevalence of ADHD of 3.4%, the highest rates being reported in France 7.3%, USA and Netherland 5% and the lowest being in Mexico and Colombia 1.9% and Spain 1.2%. These results on low levels of prevalence among adults are more related to bias in diagnostic criteria than actual reality. There are many limitations to the use of DSM IV criteria for the clinical diagnosis of adults, as the criteria were designed for children. The three symptoms (attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsivity) manifest themselves differently with adults, as the criteria are not sensitive enough to detect manifestations shown in this age group. Furthermore, impulsivity in adulthood is considered as a key feature of this disorder that leads to serious behavioral and cognitive manifestations, which the DSM only evaluates with three criteria. Other investigators had discussed at what age ADHD begins, and suggests the existence of the late onset of ADHD among adult sufferers shows that it is not essential to consider it starting before the age of 7. This study indicates that the many difficulties facing adults when recalling their infancy and forgetting information must be taken into account when making the diagnosis and it therefore recommends using information from third parties to support the retroactive diagnosis. Clinimetric instruments are now available in Spanish to assist in clinical evaluation, such as the World Health Organization's (WHO) ASRS.V.1 and ASRS.1.1 and the FASCT in Mexico with a selfadministered version and another one for the informant that uses screening tools. The Spanish-language version of the structured International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI PLUS) for the diagnosis, which explores principle psychiatric disorders, has a section on adult ADHD. The presence of comorbid disorders is very frequent and this makes it difficult to diagnose ADHD, given that other cognitive, social and work-related dysfunctions share the same symptoms. Studies show that 35 to 50% of depressive episodes throughout their lives. 40 to 60% of patients with the disorder manifest one or more of the diagnoses in the anxiety spectrum during their lives. 15.2% of adults suffering from ADHD have abused drugs, mainly alcohol and tobacco. Substance abuse complicates the diagnosis among adults, though it is important to point out that patients receiving pharmacological treatment with stimulants do not appear to face an increased risk of substances use disorders. Comorbidities and other pathologies shown by adults with ADHD must be diagnosed and treated promptly and independently of the specific and integral treatment of ADHD. Adults suffering from the disorder have the following symptoms: having difficulty in coping with waiting, making impulsive decisions, being easily distracted by irrelevant thoughts, having trouble remembering things and staying alert and awake in boring situations, not remembering as many childhood events compared with non-sufferers. The psychosocial impact is reflected in academic, vocational and work-related instability, conflictive relationships with partners, problems raising children and social lives. In regard to pharmacological treatment, there is a description of results of controlled studies, meta-analysis and in some cases open studies on drug products approved by the USA FDA, stimulants and non-stimulants that are effective in addressing the main adult ADHD symptoms and the bupropion/amfebutamone dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Psychosocial interventions for adults with ADHD include psychoeducation, cognitive behavioral therapy, individual and group therapy, neurocognitive strategies and social skills training. Studies show positive changes in behavior and attitude for those suffering from the disorder. The decision tree had three stages: Stage 0 - Focus on clinical assessment, diagnosis and psychoeducation. Psychoeducation involves understanding the clinical condition, and provides very precise explanations about the combined treatment and pharmacological prescriptions. There is no scientific evidence for the combination and escalation of pharmacological an psychosocial interventions, these recommendations were obtained by consensus of the authors. Stage 1 - Recommend using extend release or immediate release MPD, atomoxetine or amphetamines (in countries where available). For partial responses, proceed to stage1A. Stage 1A - Extended psychoeducation is combined with medication and cognitive strategies and social abilities. For partial responses proceed to stage 2. Stage 2 recommends a change in medication, if treatment had begun with short-acting MPH, change to long-acting MPH. If treatment began with the latter, change to the immediate release. If treatment began with amphetamines, change to immediate release or extended release MPH or atomexetine. For partial response proceed to stage 2A. In Stage 2A, combine medications with a psychoeducational refresher, review previous interventions, and behavior cognitive program. For partial responses processed to stage 3. Stages 3 recommends bupropion/amfebutamone, assess the response 4 weeks later, adjust the dose and observe continued response. Conclusions: The adult ADHD treatment algorithm is the result of a study by a Latin American group of mental health specialists, recommends a combined treatment using stimulant and non-stimulant drug products and psychosocial interventions.",Multimodal treatment algorithm for Latin American adults with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [Algoritmo de tratamiento multimodal para adultos latinoamericanos con trastorno por déficit de atención con hiperactividad (TDAH)],"Leon S.O., Lichinsky A., Rivera L., Castella H.S., Grevet E., Medrano A.J.",2009,Salud Mental,32,SUPPL.1,,45,53,,3,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84873040245&partnerID=40&md5=ac4856dc09d2a022033f6b75987ee51f,"Psiquiatra de Niños y de Adolescentes, LILAPETDAH, Mexico; Psiquiatra, LILAPETDAH, Argentina; Neurólogo, LILAPETDAH, Mexico; Psiquiatra, LILAPETDAH, Mexico; Psiquiatra, LILAPETDAH, Brazil; Psicóloga Clínica, LILAPETDAH, Mexico","León, S.O., Psiquiatra de Niños y de Adolescentes, LILAPETDAH, Mexico; Lichinsky, A., Psiquiatra, LILAPETDAH, Argentina; Rivera, L., Neurólogo, LILAPETDAH, Mexico; Castellá, H.S., Psiquiatra, LILAPETDAH, Mexico; Grevet, E., Psiquiatra, LILAPETDAH, Brazil; Medrano, A.J., Psicóloga Clínica, LILAPETDAH, Mexico",ADHD; Adult; Algorithm; Latin American,,ADHD;Adult;Algorithm;Latin American,"León, S.O.; Circuito Universitario, , Coyoacán, 04510, Mexico; email: silviaortiz@yahoo.com.mx",,,,,,Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria Ramon de la Fuente,1853325,,SAMEF,,Spanish,Salud Ment.,Article,Scopus,,2-s2.0-84873040245,,Mexico;Argentina;Brazil,yahoo.com.mx,,,"Leon S.O., Lichinsky A., Rivera L., Castella H.S., Grevet E., Medrano A.J.",,
,No,"An early detection of motor impairments in children is essential to improve self-care. Nevertheless, it may not be straightforward to conduct all required assessments physically in a clinic. Previous efforts in providing such a classification leveraged Machine Learning (ML)-based techniques on centralised data collected from activities of daily living (ADL); however, they used black-box optimisation methods and classification approaches that are not generalisable, hindering their application and impact in a clinical setting from an applied intelligence perspective. Thus, this study developed, applied, and validated a novel two-step neuroevolutionary optimisation approach to achieve earlier convergence in a user-centred and explainable manner, by applying early stopping based on three cross-entropy loss functions (for training, validation, and test) and optimise hyperparameters concurrently to ensure generalisation of the predictive performance by design. This method was applied to a neural network-based decision support system for aiding detection of motor impairments using three publicly available datasets on 190 children with motor impairments, including 483 socio-demographic and clinical self-care-related features in total. Such biomarkers were based on ""The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health for Children and Youth"" (ICF-CY) and retrieved from the University California Irvine ML database, which were leveraged for the initial model training, validation, and testing. Moreover, to increase users' confidence and drive adoption of the proposed applied intelligence-based tool, two additional publicly available datasets were used for validating the proposed two-step neuroevolutionary approach; such data include 34 and 39 socio-demographic and self-care-related clinical characteristics features as indicators of the functional independence of 50 further children with motor disability from a hospital in the city of Salvador, State of Bahia in Brazil. A novel, explainable and generalisable two-step neuroevolutionary approach guided early stopping based on three cross-entropy loss functions and optimised hyperparameters concurrently to improve generalisation in a neural network-based classifier. The ability of the proposed hybrid decision support system to detect motor impairments in the paediatric subjects considered was evaluated as compared to the best-performing ML-based classification systems on the same benchmark datasets to date. Whilst leveraging a transparent optimisation approach, results demonstrate its superior generalisation, quantified via the classification accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, being almost 6% higher than the most accurate and reliable ML-based system on the same benchmark dataset from published studies, thus supporting its potential for aiding classification of self-care problems in children with physical and motor disability in a clinical setting.",Neuroevolutionary intelligent system to aid diagnosis of motor impairments in children,"Lanzillotta, M., Ma, R.F., Accardi, M., RaviChandran, N., Zaernia, A., Youseffi, M., Parisi, L.",2022,APPLIED INTELLIGENCE,52,9,,10757,10767,11,0,10.1007/s10489-021-03126-3,,"[Lanzillotta, Matteo] Ctr Eteropoiesi, Dept Counselling Psychol, Inst Syst Psychotherapy, Corso Francia 98, I-10143 Turin, Italy; [Lanzillotta, Matteo; Ma, Renfei; RaviChandran, Narrendar; Parisi, Luca] Univ Auckland, Univ Auckland Rehabil Technol Assoc UARTA, 11 Symonds St, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Ma, Renfei] Chinese Univ Hong Kong CUHK SZ, Warshel Inst Computat Biol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Accardi, Marcella] Brignone Clin, Dept Psychomotric & Pedag, Via Rita Levi Montalcini 3, I-10098 Turin, Italy; [Zaernia, Amir; Youseffi, Mansour] Univ Bradford, Fac Engn & Informat, Dept Biomed & Elect Engn, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England; [Parisi, Luca] Coventry Univ, Fac Business & Law Artificial Intelligence Specia, Priory St, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England; [Parisi, Luca] Parkinsons UK, 215 Vauxhall Bridge Rd, London SW1V 1EJ, England",,Evolutionary algorithms; Early stopping; Neural networks; Optimisation; Decision support; Self-care,NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION,Evolutionary algorithms;Early stopping;Neural networks;Optimisation;Decision support;Self-care;NEURAL-NETWORK;CLASSIFICATION;REGRESSION,amatt.do@gmail.com; marenfei@cuhk.edu.cn; clinicabrignone@hotmail.com; narrendar@ieee.org; a.zaernia@bradford.ac.uk; m.youseffi@bradford.ac.uk; luca.parisi@ieee.org,,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,,SPRINGER,0924-669X,,,,English,APPL INTELL,Article,WoS,Computer Science,WOS:000744399000001,2-s2.0-85123123204,Italy;New Zealand;China;United Kingdom,gmail.com,Ctr Eteropoiesi;Univ Auckland;Chinese Univ Hong Kong CUHK SZ;Brignone Clin;Univ Bradford;Coventry Univ;Parkinsons UK,"Ctr Eteropoiesi, Italy;Univ Auckland, New Zealand;Chinese Univ Hong Kong CUHK SZ, China;Brignone Clin, Italy;Univ Bradford, United Kingdom;Coventry Univ, United Kingdom;Parkinsons UK, United Kingdom","Lanzillotta, Matteo; Ma, Renfei; Accardi, Marcella; RaviChandran, Narrendar; Zaernia, Amir; Youseffi, Mansour; Parisi, Luca",,

Not human related,No,"Zika virus (ZIKV) became a worldwide public health emergency after its introduction in the Americas. Brazil was implicated as central in the ZIKV dispersion, however, a better understanding of the pathways the virus took to arrive in Brazil and the dispersion within the country is needed. An updated genome dataset was assembled with publicly available data. Bayesian phylogeography methods were applied to reconstruct the spatiotemporal history of ZIKV in the Americas and with more detail inside Brazil. Our analyses reconstructed the Brazilian state of Pernambuco as the likely point of introduction of ZIKV in Brazil, possibly during the 2013 Confederations Cup. Pernambuco played an important role in spreading the virus to other Brazilian states. Our results also underscore the long cryptic circulation of ZIKV in all analyzed locations in Brazil.

Canada,No,"Background: Commercial aquaculture employs roughly 19 million workers globally, yet research on aquaculture occupational safety and health is extremely limited, including in developed countries like Canada. Analyses of injury and fatality compensation claims data from Scandinavian countries, Australia, the United States, and Brazil reveal aquaculture is a high-risk industry, associated with multiple hazards and high injury and fatality rates. Marine aquaculture takes place on Canada's east and west coasts. It is expanding in Atlantic Canada where it consists mainly of salmon and shellfish production. This paper presents results from a descriptive analysis of data on accepted compensation claims for injured Atlantic Canada marine aquaculture workers. Methods: Workers' compensation in Canada falls under provincial jurisdiction. Anonymous claims data between 1996 and 2017, provided by four Atlantic provincial compensation boards, captured injury claims broadly specific to the aquaculture industry, supporting a descriptive analysis of incidence rates and injury characteristics. Results: Across provinces, lost time injury rates among aquaculture workers fluctuated over time, but exceeded recent overall average provincial rates from 2010 to 2016. Consistent across provinces, almost half of all marine aquaculture injuries were caused by bodily reaction and (over)exertion (mean = 15.0%; SD = 6.4%), falls (14.4%; SD = 2.3%), or being struck by or against an object (mean = 13.7%; SD = 2.2%). Roughly half of the injuries were of three types: traumatic injuries to muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints (mean = 33.0%; SD = 3.7%), open wounds (mean = 10.1%; SD = 2.5), and surface wounds and bruises (mean = 10.0%; SD = 5.2%). The back, including spine and spinal cord was the body part most commonly affected by workplace injuries (mean = 17.2%; SD = 1.4%), followed by leg(s) (mean = 10.8%; SD = 0.5%), and finger(s)/ fingernail(s) (mean = 10.4%, SD = 4.4%). Conclusion: Findings indicate marine aquaculture workers are suffering from similar injuries (injury event, nature and source of injury, body parts) across provinces and these are similar to aquaculture sector injury claims patterns in Norway, Finland, Australia, and the United States. The high incidence rates are a strong signal that marine aquaculture in Canada, as elsewhere, is a hazardous sector. Compensation claims rates exceed overall provincial averages and have not declined. Ongoing surveillance, hazard assessments, and identification and implementation of prevention strategies could help this expanding industry reduce rates of injuries and illnesses. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Occupational safety and health in marine aquaculture in Atlantic Canada: What can be learned from an analysis of provincial occupational injury compensation claims data?,"Ochs C., Neis B., Cullen K., McGuinness E.J.",2021,Aquaculture,540,,736680,,,,6,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736680,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103782136&doi=10.1016%2fj.aquaculture.2021.736680&partnerID=40&md5=ad1e75f690cfcbe6120bd31e7a3df04e,"Department of Sociology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, 230 Elizabeth Ave, Arts Administration Building, 4th Floor, St. John's, NL  A1B 3X9, Canada; Division of Community Health and Humanities, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL  A1B 3V6, Canada; School of Human Kinetics & Recreation, Memorial University of Newfoundland Physical Education Building, Memorial University, St. John's, NL  A1C 5S7, Canada; SafetyNet Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, Memorial University of Newfoundland Bruneau Centre for Research and Innovation, Room 3046, PO Box 4200NL, Canada","Ochs, C., Department of Sociology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, 230 Elizabeth Ave, Arts Administration Building, 4th Floor, St. John's, NL  A1B 3X9, Canada; Neis, B., Department of Sociology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, 230 Elizabeth Ave, Arts Administration Building, 4th Floor, St. John's, NL  A1B 3X9, Canada; Cullen, K., Division of Community Health and Humanities, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL  A1B 3V6, Canada, School of Human Kinetics & Recreation, Memorial University of Newfoundland Physical Education Building, Memorial University, St. John's, NL  A1C 5S7, Canada, SafetyNet Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, Memorial University of Newfoundland Bruneau Centre for Research and Innovation, Room 3046, PO Box 4200NL, Canada; McGuinness, E.J., Department of Sociology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, 230 Elizabeth Ave, Arts Administration Building, 4th Floor, St. John's, NL  A1B 3X9, Canada",Aquaculture; Canada; Injury characteristics; Occupational safety and health; Salmon production,aquaculture industry; aquaculture system; data set; disease incidence; injury; marine environment; occupation; occupational exposure; public health; salmonid; shellfish; workplace; Atlantic Coast [Canada]; Atlantic Coast [North America]; Australia; Brazil; Canada; Finland; Norway; United States,Aquaculture;Canada;Injury characteristics;Occupational safety and health;Salmon production;aquaculture industry;aquaculture system;data set;disease incidence;injury;marine environment;occupation;occupational exposure;public health;salmonid;shellfish;workplace;Atlantic Coast [Canada];Atlantic Coast [North America];Australia;Brazil;Finland;Norway;United States,"Ochs, C.; Department of Sociology, 230 Elizabeth Ave, Arts Administration Building, 4<sup>th</sup> Floor, Canada; email: clgochs@mun.ca",,,,,,Elsevier B.V.,448486,,AQCLA,,English,Aquaculture,Article,Scopus,,2-s2.0-85103782136,,Canada,mun.ca,,,"Ochs C., Neis B., Cullen K., McGuinness E.J.",,
Education,No,"Occupational therapists have contributed and aim to continue creating solutions to problems within the scope of the Education sector. Thus, the objective of this research was to know and analyze the propositions of occupational therapists in Brazil who have been doing for and in School. To this end, a mapping review was carried out in the SciELO library and in the following Brazilian journals: Cadernos Brasileiros de Terapia Ocupacional and Revista de Terapia Ocupacional da Universidade de Sao Paulo, in an open period until the end of 2018. With this survey and its systematization, 36 texts were collected that articulated ""occupational therapy and school/education"". At the same time, during 2017, six interviews were conducted with Brazilian researchers who worked on the interface of occupational therapy and education. The collected data set and its analysis led to the elaboration of four thematic axes that configured and delimited the arguments used to support and problematize therapeutic-occupational propositions in dialogue with the Education sector, specifically in schools. It was evident a prevalence of practices aimed at children with disabilities under an individualized perspective approach and associated with the production of/in health has been evidenced. Simultaneously, there has been an increase in the number of proposition solutions aimed at early childhood education and socially vulnerable youth; notably, those included found in popular and poverty impoverished contexts, outlined in the individual/collective transition. It should be emphasized that the energy to designate education as a particular field of intervention for occupational therapists, with its methodological approach, technical knowledge, and specific populations, is still under construction in development and in dispute within occupational therapy itself.",Occupational therapy and education: the propositions of occupational therapists in and for school in Brazil,"Pereira, B.P., Borba, P.L.D., Lopes, R.E.",2021,CADERNOS BRASILEIROS DE TERAPIA OCUPACIONAL-BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY,29,,e2072,,,24,1,10.1590/2526-8910.ctoAO2072,,"[Pereira, Beatriz Prado] Univ Fed Paraiba UFPB, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil; [de Oliveira Borba, Patricia Leme] Univ Fed Sao Paulo Unifesp, Baixada Santista, SP, Brazil; [Lopes, Roseli Esquerdo] Univ Fed Sao Carlos UFSCar, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil",,Occupational therapy; School; Education; Mainstreaming; Education; Education; Special,TECHNOLOGIES,Occupational therapy;School;Education;Mainstreaming;Special;TECHNOLOGIES,biapradop@gmail.com,,"CUBA EDITORA, SAO CARLOS, 00000, BRAZIL",,,,CUBA EDITORA,2526-8910,,,,English,CAD BRAS TER OCUP,Article,WoS,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",WOS:000744200500073,2-s2.0-85105859933,Brazil,gmail.com,Univ Fed Paraiba UFPB;Univ Fed Sao Paulo Unifesp;Univ Fed Sao Carlos UFSCar,"Univ Fed Paraiba UFPB, Brazil;Univ Fed Sao Paulo Unifesp, Brazil;Univ Fed Sao Carlos UFSCar, Brazil","Pereira, Beatriz Prado; de Oliveira Borba, Patricia Leme; Lopes, Roseli Esquerdo",,
Review,No,"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) became the deadliest pandemic of the new millennium. One year after it became a pandemic, the current COVID-19 situation in Brazil is an example of how the impacts of a pandemic are beyond health outcomes and how health, social, and political actions are intertwined. Objectives: We aimed to provide an overview of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, from a social and political point of view, and to discuss the perspectives from now on. Methods: This is a narrative review using official, scientific (PubMed, Medline, and SciELO databases) and publicly available data. Press articles were also used that contain important information not found in these databases. Findings: We address the impacts of COVID-19 in different regions of Brazil, on indigenous populations, health care workers, and how internal social contrasts impacted the pandemic’s advance across the country. We also discuss key points that culminated in the country’s failed management of the COVID-19 spread, such as poor management of the public health care system, disparities between public and private health care infrastructure, lack of mass testing and viral spread tracking, lack of preparedness and planning to implement strict isolation and social distancing measures, and, most importantly, political instability, a deteriorating Health Ministry and sabotaging attitudes of the country’s president, including anti-scientific actions, underplaying COVID-19 severity, spreading and powering fake news about the pandemic, promoting knowingly inefficient medications for COVID-19 treatment, and interference in collective health policies, including the country’s vaccination plan. Conclusions: After one year of COVID-19 and a disastrous management of the disease, Brazil has more than 11 million cases, 270,000 deaths, and the highest number of daily deaths due to COVID-19 in the world, most of which could have been avoided and can be credited to negligence of municipal, state, and federal authorities, especially President Jair Messias Bolsonaro.

Review,No,"The checking of the assumptions on which the use of the Pearson correlation coefficient is based, is usually a task in which many errors are committed. Although the process that leads to its calculation and interpretation is simple, the task of verifying conditions such as bivariate normality or the absence of outlier is not so easy, probably because this requires the implementation of multivariate techniques. This review intends to serve as guidance to health sciences researchers, who will surely find situations in which this statistical tool should be used. The article is based on a prevalence study of metabolic syndrome carried out in the Maracaibo city, Venezuela. The main objective is to show by this example the appropriate way to verify the assumptions linked to this coefficient, not forgetting the due theoretical argument that supports them. The mathematical aspect is discarded in order to get the benefits of using computers power, for which the open source R-Studio program is used in each and every one of the processing, plotting and computation activities.

Not an open db,No,"Background:The purposes of the present study were (1) to characterize open tibial fractures and their treatment in trauma centers located across different regions of Argentina and (2) to evaluate the rates of and indications for reoperation after the surgical treatment of such fractures.Methods:This retrospective multicenter study evaluated open tibial fractures in Argentina that were operatively treated by experienced orthopaedic trauma surgeon-members of the Argentine Association of Orthopedic Trauma (AATO) between January 2015 and June 2020. Data were collected from 13 hospital databases; 8 hospitals were designated as ""interior,"" and 5 hospitals were designated as ""exterior."" The study included 701 skeletally mature patients, all of whom had a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. Information was collected on patient demographics, injury pattern and mechanism, fracture classification, treatment modality, reoperation rates, time between definitive fixation and reoperation, and indications for reoperation.Results:Seventy-six percent of presenting injuries were the result of a high-energy mechanism. Intramedullary nailing represented the most common type of fixation (88%). One hundred and fifty patients (21%) required reoperation. Delayed union/nonunion was the most common indication for reoperation in patients who had been previously treated with intramedullary nail fixation (31%; 39 of 126), and infection was the most common indication for reoperation in patients who had been treated with plate fixation (43%; 3 of 7). The time between the injury and definitive fixation was significantly different between the interior and exterior trauma centers (13.8 versus 4.7 days; p < 0.001), as was the time between definitive fixation and reoperation (69.3 versus 25.2 days; p = 0.004). The reoperation rates for the interior and exterior trauma centers were similar (20% versus 24%; p = 0.2). Infection, delayed union/nonunion, and implant removal were the most common indications for reoperation across groups.Conclusions:An improved understanding of the factors that influence treatment may help to guide future areas for improvement, establish educational goals, and create additional nationwide guidelines for open tibial fracture treatment.Level of Evidence:Prognostic Level III.

public health registry database (DATASUS),Yes,"– Background – Abdominal wall hernia is one of the most common surgical pathologies. The advent of minimally invasive surgery raised questions about the best technique to be applied, considering the possibility of reducing postoperative pain, a lower rate of complications, and early return to usual activities. Objective – To evaluate the frequency of open and laparoscopic hernioplasties in Brazil from 2008 to 2018, analyzing the rates of urgent and elective surgeries, mortality, costs, and the impact of laparoscopic surgical training on the public health system. Methods – Nationwide data from 2008 to 2018 were obtained from the public health registry database (DATASUS) for a descriptive analysis of the selected data and parameters. Results – 2,671,347 hernioplasties were performed in the period, an average of 242,850 surgeries per year (99.4% open, 0.6% laparoscopic). The economically active population (aged 20-59) constituted the dominant group (54.5%). There was a significant reduction (P<0.01) in open surgeries, without a compensatory increase in laparoscopic procedures. 22.3% of surgeries were urgent, with a significant increase in mortality when compared to elective surgeries (P<0.01). The distribution of laparoscopic surgery varied widely, directly associated with the number of digestive surgeons. Conclusion – This study presents nationwide data on hernia repair surgeries in Brazil for the first time. Minimally invasive techniques represent a minor portion of hernioplasties. Urgent surgeries represent a high percentage when compared to other countries, with increased mortality.

"we present the openEHR Benchmark Dataset, ORBDA, a very large healthcare benchmark dataset",Yes,"The openEHR specifications are designed to support implementation of flexible and interoperable Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. Despite the increasing number of solutions based on the openEHR specifications, it is difficult to find publicly available healthcare datasets in the openEHR format that can be used to test, compare and validate different data persistence mechanisms for openEHR. To foster research on openEHR servers, we present the openEHR Benchmark Dataset, ORBDA, a very large healthcare benchmark dataset encoded using the openEHR formalism. To construct ORBDA, we extracted and cleaned a de-identified dataset from the Brazilian National Healthcare System (SUS) containing hospitalisation and high complexity procedures information and formalised it using a set of openEHR archetypes and templates. Then, we implemented a tool to enrich the raw relational data and convert it into the openEHR model using the openEHR Java reference model library. The ORBDA dataset is available in composition, versioned composition and EHR openEHR representations in XML and JSON formats. In total, the dataset contains more than 150 million composition records. We describe the dataset and provide means to access it. Additionally, we demonstrate the usage of ORBDA for evaluating inserting throughput and query latency performances of some NoSQL database management systems. We believe that ORBDA is a valuable asset for assessing storage models for openEHR-based information systems during the software engineering process. It may also be a suitable component in future standardised benchmarking of available openEHR storage platforms.",ORBDA: An &ITopen&ITEHR benchmark dataset for performance assessment of electronic health record servers,"Teodoro, D., Sundvall, E., Joao, M., Ruch, P., Freire, S.M.",2018,PLOS ONE,13,1,e0190028,,,22,13,10.1371/journal.pone.0190028,,"[Teodoro, Douglas; Joao Junior, Mario, Jr.; Freire, Sergio Miranda] Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Dept Tecnol Informacao & Educ Saude, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Teodoro, Douglas; Ruch, Patrick] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, SIB Text Min, Geneva, Switzerland; [Teodoro, Douglas; Ruch, Patrick] HEG Geneva, HES SO, Dept Informat Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Sundvall, Erik] Linkoping Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Linkoping, Sweden; [Sundvall, Erik] Reg Ostergotland, Linkoping, Sweden",,,KNOWLEDGE GOVERNANCE; OPENEHR; INTEROPERABILITY; CARE,KNOWLEDGE GOVERNANCE;OPENEHR;INTEROPERABILITY;CARE,douglas.teodoro@sib.swiss,,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",,,,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,1932-6203,,,29293556,English,PLOS ONE,Article,WoS,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000419101600054,2-s2.0-85039974376,Brazil;Switzerland;Sweden,sib.swiss,Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro;Swiss Inst Bioinformat;HEG Geneva;Linkoping Univ;Reg Ostergotland,"Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Switzerland;HEG Geneva, Switzerland;Linkoping Univ, Sweden;Reg Ostergotland, Sweden","Teodoro, Douglas; Sundvall, Erik; Joao Junior, Mario, Jr.; Ruch, Patrick; Freire, Sergio Miranda",,
Review,No,"The past 20 years have witnessed an astonishing increase in computational power and an incredible reduction in the cost of contemporary computer systems, but the public health infostructure in most countries has not changed significantly. This article discusses the potential benefits of applying patient-centered infostructure at the primary medical ""points-of-care"" services, based on networked integrated open-source technology and programming standards to develop tools to detect and reduce health inequalities. Such systems, which could be implemented from the local to the national level, would enable the expansion of evidence-based medicine, clearer identification of health inequalities, and more accurate cost-benefit analyses. In addition, the public health sector could link such databases to traditional Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems at a greatly reduced cost by promoting the use of standards-based formats for data transfer and storage. Ultimately, the new health infostructure would help decrease health inequity. In fact, developing countries like Brazil, India, and South Africa are well-positioned to take advantage of the open-source movement and ""leapfrog"" countries burdened by legacy systems.",Overcoming health inequity: Potential benefits of a patient-centered open-source public health infostructure,"Marques Jr. E.T.A., Maciel Filho R., August P.N.",2008,Cadernos de Saude Publica,24,3,,547,557,,12,10.1590/S0102-311X2008000300008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-40849115500&doi=10.1590%2fS0102-311X2008000300008&partnerID=40&md5=47154630150d641af1c63885d365a3ef,"Centro de Pesquisas Aggeu Magalhães, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Recife, Brazil; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States; Kenzen Systems Pte Ltd., Singapore City, Singapore; Laboratório de Virologia e Terapia Experimental, Centro de Pesquisas Aggeu Magalhães, Campus da Cidade Universitária, Av.

Not human related,No,"Snakebite envenoming affects close to 2.7 million people globally every year. In Brazil, snakebites are reported to the Ministry of Health surveillance system and cases receive antivenom free of charge. There is an urgent need to identify higher risk areas for antivenom distribution, and to develop prevention activities. The objective of this study is to provide an overview of the epidemiological situation of snakebite envenoming in Brazil and explore possible drivers; as well as to create a flowchart tool to support decision-makers identify higher risk areas. An ecological-type study was carried out using data by municipality (2013-2017). Study parts: 1) Create a geocoded database and perform a descriptive and cluster analysis; 2) Statistical analysis to measure the association of snakebite and possible environmental and socioeconomic drivers; 3) Develop a flowchart to support decision-makers and the application of this tool in one state (Rio Grande do Sul) as an example. An average of 27,120 snakebite cases per year were reported at the country level. Clusters of municipalities with high numbers of snakebites are mostly found in the Amazon Legal Region. The negative binomial regression model showed association with the snakebite case count: the type of major habitat, tropical or non-tropical; temperature; percentage of urbanization; precipitation; elevation; GDP per capita; a weaker relation with forest loss; and with venomous snake richness. The state where the instrument was applied reported 4,227 snakebites in the period. Most municipalities were considered as medium risk and 56/496 as high risk according to the tool created. Snakebite cases are distributed across the entire country with the highest concentration in the Legal Amazon Region. This creates a complex situation both for better understanding of the association of environmental and socioeconomic factors with snakebites and for the distribution and maintenance of antivenom to remote areas.

Review,No,"CONTEXT That few data are available on the characteristics of medical schools or on trends within medical education internationally constitutes a major challenge when developing strategies to address physician workforce shortages. Quality and up-to-date information is needed to improve health and education policy planning. METHODS We used publicly available data from the International Medical Education Directory and Avicenna Directories, and an internal education programme database to gather data on medical education provision worldwide. We sent a semi-structured questionnaire to a selection of 346 medical schools, of which 218 (63%) in 81 different countries or territories replied. We contacted ministries of health, national agencies for accreditation or similar bodies to clarify inconsistencies among sources. We identified key informants to obtain country-level specific information. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse current medical school data by country. RESULTS There are about 2600 medical schools worldwide. The countries with the largest numbers of schools are India (n = 304), Brazil (n = 182), the USA (n = 173), China (n = 147) and Pakistan (n = 86). One-third of all medical schools are located in five countries and nearly half are located in 10 countries. Of 207 independent states, 24 have no medical school and 50 have only one. Regionally, numbers of citizens per school differ: the Caribbean region has one school per 0.6 million population; the Americas and Oceania each have one school per 1.2 million population; Europe has one school per 1.8 million population; Asia has one school per 3.5 million population, and Africa has one school per 5.0 million population. In 2012, on average, there were 181 graduates per medical school. CONCLUSIONS The total number and distribution of medical schools around the world are not well matched with existing physician numbers and distribution. The collection and aggregation of medical school data are complex and would benefit from better information on local recognition processes. Longitudinal comparisons are difficult and subject to several sources of error. The consistency and quality of medical school data need to be improved to accurately document potential supply; one example of such an advancement is the World Directory of Medical Schools.",Overview of the world's medical schools: an update,"Duvivier, R.J., Boulet, J.R., Opalek, A., van Zanten, M., Norcini, J.",2014,MEDICAL EDUCATION,48,9,,860,869,10,57,10.1111/medu.12499,,"[Duvivier, Robbert J.; Boulet, John R.; Opalek, Amy; van Zanten, Marta; Norcini, John] FAIMER, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,,HUMAN-RESOURCES; PHYSICIANS; WORKFORCE; SHORTAGE; DOCTORS,HUMAN-RESOURCES;PHYSICIANS;WORKFORCE;SHORTAGE;DOCTORS,robbertduvivier@gmail.com,,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,WILEY,0308-0110,,,25113113,English,MED EDUC,Article,WoS,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services,WOS:000340415000006,2-s2.0-84905686910,United States,gmail.com,FAIMER,"FAIMER, United States","Duvivier, Robbert J.; Boulet, John R.; Opalek, Amy; van Zanten, Marta; Norcini, John",,
Not human related,No,"The multidisciplinary project Prediction of Air Pollution in Latin America and the Caribbean (PA-PILA) is dedicated to the development and implementation of an air quality analysis and forecasting system to assess pollution impacts on human health and economy. In this context, a comprehensive emission inventory for South America was developed on the basis of the existing data on the global dataset CAMS-GLOB-ANT v4.1 (developed by joining CEDS trends and EDGAR v4.3.2 historical data), enriching it with data derived from locally available emission inventories for Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. This work presents the results of the first joint effort of South American researchers and European colleagues to generate regional maps of emissions, together with a methodological approach to continue incorporating information into future versions of the dataset. This version of the PAPILA dataset includes CO, NOx, NMVOCs, NH3, and SO2 annual emissions from anthropogenic sources for the period 2014-2016, with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees over a domain that covers 32-120 degrees W and 34 degrees N-58 degrees S. The PAPILA dataset is presented as netCDF4 files and is available in an open-access data repository under a CC-BY 4 license: . A comparative assessment of PAPILA-CAMS datasets was carried out for (i) the South American region, (ii) the countries with local data (Argentina, Colombia, and Chile), and (iii) downscaled emission maps for urban domains with different environmental and anthropogenic factors. Relevant differences were found at both country and urban levels for all the compounds analyzed. Among them, we found that when comparing PAPILA total emissions versus CAMS datasets at the national level, higher levels of NOx and considerably lower levels of the other species were obtained for Argentina, higher levels of SO2 and lower levels of CO and NOx for Colombia, and considerably higher levels of CO, NMVOCs, and SO2 for Chile. These discrepancies are mainly related to the representativeness of local practices in the local emission estimates, to the improvements made in the spatial distribution of the locally estimated emissions, or to both. Both datasets were evaluated against surface concentrations of CO and NOx by using them as input data to the WRF-Chem model for one of the analyzed domains, the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, for summer and winter of 2015. PAPILA-based modeling results had a smaller bias for CO and NOx concentrations in winter while CAMS-based results for the same period tended to deliver an underestimation of these concentrations. Both inventories exhibited similar performances for CO in summer, while the PAPILA simulation outperformed CAMS for NOx concentrations. These results highlight the importance of refining global inventories with local data to obtain accurate results with high-resolution air quality models.",PAPILA dataset: a regional emission inventory of reactive gases for South America based on the combination of local and global information,"Castesana, P., Resquin, M.D., Huneeus, N., Puliafito, E., Darras, S., Gomez, D., Granier, C., Alvarado, M.O., Rojas, N., Dawidowski, L.",2022,EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA,14,1,,271,293,23,1,10.5194/essd-14-271-2022,,"[Castesana, Paula; Puliafito, Enrique] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Castesana, Paula; Diaz Resquin, Melisa; Gomez, Dario; Dawidowski, Laura] Comis Nacl Energia Atom, Gerencia Quim, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Castesana, Paula; Dawidowski, Laura] Univ Nacl San Martin, Inst Invest & Ingn Ambiental, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Diaz Resquin, Melisa; Gomez, Dario] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ingn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Diaz Resquin, Melisa; Huneeus, Nicolas] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR2, Santiago, Chile; [Huneeus, Nicolas] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Fis & Matemat, Dept Geofis, Santiago, Chile; [Puliafito, Enrique] Natl Technol Univ FRM UTN, Mendoza Reg Fac, Mendoza, Argentina; [Darras, Sabine; Granier, Claire] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, Lab Aerol, Toulouse, France; [Granier, Claire] Univ Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Granier, Claire] NOAA, Chem Sci Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Osses Alvarado, Mauricio] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria UTFSM, Dept Ingn Mecan, Santiago, Chile; [Rojas, Nestor] Univ Nacl Colombia, Air Qual Res Grp, Bogota, Colombia",,,ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS; METROPOLITAN-AREA; SAO-PAULO; QUALITY; TRANSPORT; MODEL; CHEMISTRY; AEROSOLS; OZONE; PM2.5,ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS;METROPOLITAN-AREA;SAO-PAULO;QUALITY;TRANSPORT;MODEL;CHEMISTRY;AEROSOLS;OZONE;PM2.5,pcastesana@unsam.edu.ar; mdiazresquin@fi.uba.ar,,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",,,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,1866-3508,,,,English,EARTH SYST SCI DATA,Article; Data Paper,WoS,Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000751111100001,,Argentina;Chile;France;United States;Colombia,unsam.edu.ar,Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn;Comis Nacl Energia Atom;Univ Nacl San Martin;Univ Buenos Aires;Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR2;Univ Chile;Natl Technol Univ FRM UTN;Univ Toulouse;Univ Colorado;NOAA;Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria UTFSM;Univ Nacl Colombia,"Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Argentina;Comis Nacl Energia Atom, Argentina;Univ Nacl San Martin, Argentina;Univ Buenos Aires, Argentina;Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR2, Chile;Univ Chile, Chile;Natl Technol Univ FRM UTN, Argentina;Univ Toulouse, France;Univ Colorado, United States;NOAA, United States;Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria UTFSM, Chile;Univ Nacl Colombia, Colombia","Castesana, Paula; Diaz Resquin, Melisa; Huneeus, Nicolas; Puliafito, Enrique; Darras, Sabine; Gomez, Dario; Granier, Claire; Osses Alvarado, Mauricio; Rojas, Nestor; Dawidowski, Laura",,
administrative database,No,"Introduction: The Brazilian Government created Participatory Health Councils (PHCs) to allow citizen participation in the public health policy process. PHCs are advisory bodies that operate at all levels of government and that bring together different societal groups to monitor Brazil's health system. Today they are present in 98% of Brazilian cities, demonstrating their popularity and thus their potential to help ensure that health policies are in line with citizen preferences. Despite their expansive reach, their real impact on health policies and health outcomes for citizens is uncertain. We thus ask the following question: Do PHCs offer meaningful opportunities for open participation and influence in the public health policy process?. Methods: Thirty-eight semi-structured interviews with health council members were conducted. Data from these interviews were analyzed using a qualitative interpretive content analysis approach. A quantitative analysis of PHC data from the Sistema de Acompanhamento dos Conselhos de Saude (SIACS) database was also conducted to corroborate findings from the interviews. Results: We learned that PHCs fall short in many of the categories of good governance. Government manipulation of the agenda and leadership of the PHCs, delays in the implementation of PHC decision making, a lack of training of council members on relevant technical issues, the largely narrow interests of council members, the lack of transparency and monitoring guidelines, a lack of government support, and a lack of inclusiveness are a few examples that highlight why PHCs are not as effective as they could be. Conclusions: Although PHCs are intended to be inclusive and participatory, in practice they seem to have little impact on the health policymaking process in Brazil. PHCs will only be able to fulfil their mandate when we see good governance largely present. This will require a rethinking of their governance structures, processes, membership, and oversight. If change is resisted, the PHCs will remain largely limited to a good idea in theory that is disappointing in practice.",Participatory health councils and good governance: healthy democracy in Brazil?,"Kohler, J.C., Martinez, M.G.",2015,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH,14,,21,,,9,12,10.1186/s12939-015-0151-5,,"[Kohler, Jillian Clare] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada; [Kohler, Jillian Clare] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada; [Martinez, Martha Gabriela] Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada",,,,,jillian.kohler@utoronto.ca,,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,,,BMC,1475-9276,,,25889170,English,INT J EQUITY HEALTH,Article,WoS,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",WOS:000350172900001,2-s2.0-84924043881,Canada,utoronto.ca,Univ Toronto,"Univ Toronto, Canada","Kohler, Jillian Clare; Martinez, Martha Gabriela",,
Don't mention south america,No,"Time-series forecasting is one of the most active research topics in artificial intelligence. It has the power to bring light to problems in several areas of knowledge, such as epidemiological studies, healthcare inference, and climate change analysis. Applications in real-world time series should consider two factors for achieving reliable predictions: modeling dynamic dependencies among multiple variables and adjusting the model's intrinsic hyperparameters. An open gap in the literature is that statistical and ensemble learning approaches systematically present lower predictive performance than deep learning methods. The existing applications consistently disregard the data sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions, named after Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with tens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones. The results outperformed both statistical and ensemble-learning approaches, showing an improvement of 64.87 percent over the competing algorithms on the SARS-CoV-2 dataset of the renowned John Hopkins University for 188 countries simultaneously. For further validation, we tested our architecture in two other public datasets of different domains, the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2012 and Brazilian Weather datasets. We also analyzed the Evolution Weights arising from the hidden layers of ReGENN to describe how the variables of the dataset interact with each other; and, as a result of looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously, we concluded that time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously evolve.",Pay Attention to Evolution: Time Series Forecasting With Deep Graph-Evolution Learning,"Spadon, G., Hong, S.D., Brandoli, B., Matwin, S., Rodrigues, J.F., Sun, J.M.",2022,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE,44,9,,5368,5384,17,8,10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3076155,,"[Spadon, Gabriel; Rodrigues-Jr, Jose F.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Math & Comp Sci, BR-13566590 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Spadon, Gabriel; Sun, Jimeng] Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Comp, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Hong, Shenda] Peking Univ, Natl Inst Hlth Data Sci, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Hong, Shenda] Peking Univ, Inst Med Technol, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Brandoli, Bruno; Matwin, Stan] Dalhousie Univ, Inst Big Data Analyt, Halifax, NS B3H 1W5, Canada; [Matwin, Stan] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Comp Sci, PL-52500094 Warsaw, Poland; [Rodrigues-Jr, Jose F.] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Fac Sci, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France; [Sun, Jimeng] Univ Illinois, Dept Comp Sci, Champaign, IL 61801 USA",,Forecasting; Time series analysis; COVID-19; Predictive models; Evolution (biology); Sun; Recurrent neural networks; Time series; graph evolution; representation learning,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS,Forecasting;Time series analysis;COVID-19;Predictive models;Evolution (biology);Sun;Recurrent neural networks;Time series;graph evolution;representation learning;ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS,spadon@usp.br; hongshenda@pku.edu.cn; brunobrandoli@dal.ca; stan@cs.dal.ca; junio@icmc.usp.br; jsun@cc.gatech.edu,,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",,,,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,0162-8828,,,33905327,English,IEEE T PATTERN ANAL,Article,WoS,Computer Science; Engineering,WOS:000836666600062,2-s2.0-85105077962,Brazil;United States;China;Canada;Poland;France,usp.br,Univ Sao Paulo;Georgia Inst Technol;Peking Univ;Dalhousie Univ;Polish Acad Sci;Univ Grenoble Alpes;Univ Illinois,"Univ Sao Paulo, Brazil;Georgia Inst Technol, United States;Peking Univ, China;Dalhousie Univ, Canada;Polish Acad Sci, Poland;Univ Grenoble Alpes, France;Univ Illinois, United States","Spadon, Gabriel; Hong, Shenda; Brandoli, Bruno; Matwin, Stan; Rodrigues-Jr, Jose F.; Sun, Jimeng",,
obtained from DATASUS/SISNAC,Yes,"Background: Pregnancy in adolescents is a worldwide health problem and has been mostly common in poor populations. It is not clear if socioeconomic or biological factors are the main determinants of perinatal adverse outcomes in pregnant adolescents. Adolescents under 15 years old may present a high growth rate which may contribute to impair fetal growth. Our aim is to compare perinatal characteristics among early (aged 10 to 14 years) and late (aged 15 to 19 years) pregnant adolescents. Methods. A cross-sectional study was performed using data from Pernambuco State 2009, obtained from DATASUS/SISNAC, a Brazilian Government, open-access public health database. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between early (aged 10-14 years) and late (aged 15-19 years) pregnant adolescents. Family income was compared between early and late pregnant adolescents using a sample of 412 subjects evaluated at Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP) during 2011. Statistical comparisons were made using the chi-square test was used with a significant level of 0.05; bivariate and multivariate analysis were performed. This project was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board. Results: Data from 31,209 pregnant adolescents were analyzed. 29,733 (95.2%) were aged 15 to 19 years and 1,476 (4.7%) were aged 10 to 14 years. There were significant differences with respect to marital status, education level and number of prenatal visits of mothers aged 10 to 14 years compared to 15 to 19 years. Of importance, early adolescents had a greater rate of neonates born premature and with low birth weight. Prematurity and low birth weight remained statistically significant after multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Early aged adolescents may have an increased risk of prematurity and low birth weight. These findings highlight the potential role of biological factors in newborn outcomes in pregnant adolescents. © 2012 Alves et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Perinatal characteristics among early (10-14 years old) and late (15-19 years old) pregnant adolescents,"Alves J.G.B., Cisneiros R.M.R., Dutra L.P.F., Pinto R.A.",2012,BMC Research Notes,5,,531,,,,23,10.1186/1756-0500-5-531,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866538161&doi=10.1186%2f1756-0500-5-531&partnerID=40&md5=e6ef450cabfe550e1f4930a32d440686,"Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP), Rua dos Coelhos 300, Boa Vista, Recife PE, 50070-550, Brazil; Universidade Do Vale Do São Francisco (UNIVASF), Campos Universitário, Av.

Review,No,"This study focuses on retraction notices from two major Latin American/Caribbean indexing databases: SciELO and LILACS. SciELO includes open scientific journals published mostly in Latin America/the Caribbean, from which 10 % are also indexed by Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge Journal of Citation Reports (JCR). LILACS has a similar geographical coverage and includes dissertations and conference/symposia proceedings, but it is limited to publications in the health sciences. A search for retraction notices was performed in these two databases using the keywords ""retracted"", ""retraction"" ""withdrawal"", ""withdrawn"", ""removed"" and ""redress"". Documents were manually checked to identify those that actually referred to retractions, which were then analyzed and categorized according to the reasons alleged in the notices. Dates of publication/retraction and time to retraction were also recorded. Searching procedures were performed between June and December 2014. Thirty-one retraction notices were identified, fifteen of which were in JCR-indexed journals. ""Plagiarism"" was alleged in six retractions of this group. Among the non-JCR journals, retraction reasons were alleged in fourteen cases, twelve of which were attributed to ""plagiarism"". The proportion of retracted articles for the SciELO database was approximately 0.005 %. The reasons alleged in retraction notices may be used as signposts to inform discussions in Latin America on plagiarism and research integrity.

Hospital length of stay (LOS) records were obtained with Rio de Janeiro City Health Department (RJHD),Yes,"The COVID-19 pandemic recently challenges worldwide health system. Many countries have been establishing several rules in order to fight against the expected exponentially growth of affected people. After some weeks hospital bed occupancy started to grow because of infected people and this demand can potentially overlap hospital bed capacity. In this scenario, doctors would have to decide who should be treated and patients without adequate treatment can increase number of deaths. Thus, in order to avoid that patient demand overlap hospital bed capacity, this research propose a forecast and simulation approach in order to provide the number of intensive care beds and health care professionals that could be available in a short-term of 21 days ahead taking into account 3 patient demand scenarios. This research is applied to Rio de Janeiro city (Brazil) and all records were retrieved from Rio de Janeiro public database.

I think the db is from US,No,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that the prescription of remdesivir should be cautious for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 and some studies reported risk of adverse renal events. The available information on the renal safety profile for remdesivir is limited, thus we analyzed the renal and urinary adverse reactions attributed to remdesivir reported in a large open pharmacovigilance database. We obtained reports of remdesivir and other drugs used to treat COVID-19 (tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir) registered by September 30 2020, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). We analyzed the reporting odds ratios (RORs) for reports of adverse renal and urinary events for remdesivir and other drugs. We found 2,922 reports with remdesivir registered in FAERS for COVID-19. Among these, 493 renal and urinary adverse effects (16.9%) were reported. The most frequent events were acute kidney injury (338; 11.6%), renal impairment (86; 2.9%), and renal failure (53; 1.8%). Versus hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, or tocilizumab, the use of remdesivir was associated with an increased chance of reporting renal and urinary disorders regardless of gender and age of patients (2.53; 95%CI: 2.10-3.06). The ROR remained significant when we restricted the analysis to hydroxychloroquine (4.31; 95%CI: 3.25-5.71) or tocilizumab (3.92; 95%CI: 2.51-6.12). Our results reinforce this already reported signal, emphasizing that it could be extremely useful for health professionals who prescribe this new antiviral to treat COVID-19, mainly knowing its low efficacy. © 2021 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

,No,"Background Many new cancer drugs are being approved by reputed regulatory authorities without evidence of overall survival benefit, quality of life improvement, and often based on clinical trials at high risk of bias. In recent years, most Latin American (LA) countries have reformed their marketing authorization (MA) rules to directly accept or abbreviate the approval process in case of earlier authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration, mainly. This study assessed the potential impact of decisions taken by EMA regarding the approval of new cancer drugs based on no evidence of overall survival or in potentially biased clinical trials in LA countries Design Descriptive analysis. Setting Publicly accessible marketing authorization databases from LA regulators, European Public Assessment Report by EMA, and previous studies accessing EMA approvals of new cancer drugs 2009 2016. Main outcome and measures Number of new cancer drugs approved by LA countries without evidence of overall survival (2009 2013), and without at least one clinical trial scored at low risk of bias, or with no trial supporting the marketing authorization at all (2014 2016) Results Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru have publicly accessible and trustful MA databases and were included. Of the 17 cancer drugs approved by EMA (2009 2013) without evidence of OS benefit after a postmarketing median time of 5.4 years, 6 LA regulators approved more than 70% of them. Of the 13 drugs approved by EMA (2014 2016), either without supporting trial or with no trial at low risk of bias, Brazil approved 11, Chile 10, Peru 10, Argentina 10, Colombia 9, Ecuador 9, and Panama 8. Conclusions LA countries keep approving new cancer drugs often based on poorly performed clinical trials measuring surrogate endpoints. EMA and other reputed regulators must be aware that their regulatory decisions might directly influence decisions regarding MA, health budgets and patient s care elsewhere. © 2021 Durán et al.

,No,"IntroductionUSA300 has remained the dominant community and healthcare associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clone in the United States and in northern South America for at least the past 20 years. In this time, it has experienced epidemic spread in both of these locations. However, its pre-epidemic evolutionary history and origins are incompletely understood. Large sequencing databases, such as NCBI, PATRIC, and Staphopia, contain clues to the early evolution of USA300 in the form of sequenced genomes of USA300 isolates that are representative of lineages that diverged prior to the establishment of the South American epidemic (SAE) clade and North American epidemic (NAE) clade. In addition, historical isolates collected prior to the emergence of epidemics can help reconstruct early events in the history of this lineage. MethodsHere, we take advantage of the accrued, publicly available data, as well as two newly sequenced pre-epidemic historical isolates from 1996, and a very early diverging ACME-negative NAE genome, to understand the pre-epidemic evolution of USA300. We use database mining techniques to emphasize genomes similar to pre-epidemic isolates, with the goal of reconstructing the early molecular evolution of the USA300 lineage. ResultsPhylogenetic analysis with these genomes confirms that the NAE and SAE USA300 lineages diverged from a most recent common ancestor around 1970 with high confidence, and it also pinpoints the independent acquisition events of the of the ACME and COMER loci with greater precision than in previous studies. We provide evidence for a North American origin of the USA300 lineage and identify multiple introductions of USA300 into South and North America. Notably, we describe a third major USA300 clade (the pre-epidemic branching clade; PEB1) consisting of both MSSA and MRSA isolates circulating around the world that diverged from the USA300 lineage prior to the establishment of the South and North American epidemics. We present a detailed analysis of specific sequence characteristics of each of the major clades, and present diagnostic positions that can be used to classify new genomes.",Pre-epidemic evolution of the MRSA USA300 clade and a molecular key for classification,"Bianco, C.M., Moustafa, A.M., O'Brien, K., Martin, M.A., Read, T.D., Kreiswirth, B.N., Planet, P.J.",2023,FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY,13,,1081070,,,13,0,10.3389/fcimb.2023.1081070,,"[Bianco, Colleen M.; Moustafa, Ahmed M.; Planet, Paul J.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Pediat Infect Dis, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Moustafa, Ahmed M.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Philadelphia, PA USA; [O'Brien, Kelsey] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Martin, Michael A.; Read, Timothy D.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Atlanta, GA USA; [Martin, Michael A.; Read, Timothy D.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis, Atlanta, GA USA; [Kreiswirth, Barry N.] Hackensack Meridian Hlth, Ctr Discovery & Innovat, Nutley, NJ USA; [Planet, Paul J.] Univ Penn, Perelman Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Planet, Paul J.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, New York, NY 10024 USA",,USA300; SNPs; phylogenetic; epidemics; molecular key,RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; EMERGENCE; CLONE; SEQUENCE; PROTEIN,USA300;SNPs;phylogenetic;epidemics;molecular key;RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS;EMERGENCE;CLONE;SEQUENCE;PROTEIN,planetp@email.chop.edu,,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,,,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,2235-2988,,,36761897,English,FRONT CELL INFECT MI,Article,WoS,Immunology; Microbiology,WOS:000924815500001,2-s2.0-85147445749,United States,email.chop.edu,Childrens Hosp Philadelphia;Univ Penn;Emory Univ;Hackensack Meridian Hlth;Amer Museum Nat Hist,"Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, United States;Univ Penn, United States;Emory Univ, United States;Hackensack Meridian Hlth, United States;Amer Museum Nat Hist, United States","Bianco, Colleen M.; Moustafa, Ahmed M.; O'Brien, Kelsey; Martin, Michael A.; Read, Timothy D.; Kreiswirth, Barry N.; Planet, Paul J.",,
dont have access ,No,"Introduction: To optimize the early care of burned patients, protocols were developed that guide pre-hospital care and the need to transfer to a specialized burn treatment unit. Burn disasters are an important public health concern in developed and developing nations. Among the early steps in disaster preparedness is the understanding of geographic locations and capacity of burn care facilities. We aimed to map and classify medical facilities that provide burn care in Brazil and to undertake a location-allocation analysis to identify which could be targeted to increase capacity. Methods: A review of burn hospitalizations was conducted using Brazilian Ministry of Health data. Capacity was defined by number of burn patients admitted each year and bed type. Spatial population data per one-square kilometer were obtained from World Pop as a raster dataset. A road network dataset using Open Street Map data was created to conduct the drive time analysis. Location/allocation analysis was conducted to identify the proportion of Brazil's population living within 2- and 6-hours’ drive time of a burn care capable hospital, stratified by the level of hospital capacity. Hospitals were ranked according to number of additional people served. Results: We found 26.471 burn admissions. Of these, 3.508(13,2 %) were ICU admissions. A total of 735(2,7 %) hospital deaths occurred under the selected burn codes. In all, 1.273 facilities admitted burn patients, and 263(20,7 %) reported ICU admissions of burn patients. Seventeen hospitals were classified as maximum capacity facilities. Additional 23 hospitals were identified as potential targets for capacity building. Most maximum capacity hospitals are clustered in the Southeast of Brazil. Currently, 40.8 % of the Brazilian population live within 2 h of a maximum capacity facility. A large part of the population lives farther than 6 h away from a maximum capacity hospital. Most of the potential targets for capacity building are located near the coast of Brazil. Discussion: We mapped and classified facilities that provide public burn care in Brazil. We identified public facilities that could be targeted to increase capacity to improve access for patients in the event of a burn disaster. Mapping, planning, and coordinating response is key for optimal outcomes in Mass Casualties Incidents. Cataloging and understanding local resources is a crucial first step in disaster management. Inequality in profiles can determine specific regional needs. Specialized burn centers are rare in regions other than the southeast. Health equity should be considered when planning disaster preparedness initiatives. Location-allocation modelling may assist in universal and equitable burn care service offerings. Conclusion: This study proposes an initial step in the classification and mapping of available burn treatment centers and population coverage in Brazil. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and International Society of Burns Injuries",Preparing for a burn disaster in Brazil: Geospatial modelling to inform a coordinated response,"Daher R.P., Gause E., Stewart B.T., Gragnani A.",2022,Burns,,,,,,,0,10.1016/j.burns.2022.08.026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139052575&doi=10.1016%2fj.burns.2022.08.026&partnerID=40&md5=dd6496b713903c3aa6d450de4e2bee99,"Escola Paulista de Medicina/Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Brazil and Washington University, United States","Daher, R.P., Escola Paulista de Medicina/Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Brazil and Washington University, United States; Gause, E., Escola Paulista de Medicina/Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Brazil and Washington University, United States; Stewart, B.T., Escola Paulista de Medicina/Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Brazil and Washington University, United States; Gragnani, A., Escola Paulista de Medicina/Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Brazil and Washington University, United States",Brazil; Burn Disaster; Burn treatment centers; Coordinated response; Geospatial modelling,,Brazil;Burn Disaster;Burn treatment centers;Coordinated response;Geospatial modelling,"Gragnani, A.; Discipline of Plastic Surgery - EPM / UNIFESP, Rua Botucatu, 740 - 2nd floor.

,No,"Objectives: A retrospective study was conducted to identify the prevalence of COVID-19 through serology and RT-PCR in children, adolescents and adults. A database of the COVID-19 Tracking Program in school children was used Methods: The data comprised sociodemographic and clinical variables, results of serological tests (IgM and IgG), and real-time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results of IgM-positive individuals. The statistical analysis was performed with a 5% significance level. Results: Among 423 children, 107 (25.3%) exhibited seroprevalence with IgG, IgM or IgG/IgM; among 854 adolescents, 250 (29.2%) had positive serology; and among 282 adults, 59 (20.9%) were positive. The frequency of positivity on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was 3.5%, 3.6% and 6.0% in children, adolescents and adults, respectively. Children had a lower incidence of symptoms than adolescents (p = 0.001) and adults (p = 0.003); the most frequent were fever, ageusia, anosmia, headache, dry cough, sore throat, muscle pain, runny nose, dyspnoea, and diarrhoea. Conclusions: The prevalence rate for all groups was 26.7% in serology and 4.04% in RT-PCR. Children had lower rates of IgM and fewer symptoms compared with adolescents and adults. The data suggest the potential for transmissibility in all age groups. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

,No,"We aimed to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with parents' non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19 in Colombia and Peru. We performed a secondary analysis using a database generated by the University of Maryland and Facebook (Facebook, Inc). We Included adult (18 and over) Facebook users residing in LAC who responded to the survey between May 20, and November 5, 2021. We Included sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, mental health, economic and food insecurity, compliance with mitigation strategies against COVID-19, and practices related to vaccination against this disease. We estimated crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios with their respective 95 %CI. We analyzed a sample of 44,678 adults from Colombia and 24,302 from Peru. The prevalence of parents' non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19 was 7.41 % (n = 3,274) for Colombia and 6.64 % (n =1,464) for Peru. In Colombia, age above 35 years old, compliance with physical distancing, use of masks, having economic insecurity, anxiety symptoms, having a chronic condition or more comorbidities, and being vaccinated were associated with a higher probability of vaccinating children and adolescents against COVID-19. In Peru, female gender, compliance with physical distancing, use of masks, having economic insecurity, anxiety symptoms, having a chronic condition or more comorbidities, having had COVID-19, and being vaccinated were associated with a higher probability of vaccinating children against COVID-19. Living in a town, a village, or a rural area was associated with a higher prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children and adolescents against COVID-19. About 9 out of 10 parents in Colombia and Peru intend to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19. This intention is associated with some factors which are similar between the two countries, as well as other factors and variations among the different regions of each country.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We used the public database of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil),Yes,"Background Knowledge regarding the modifiable risk factors of dementia is fundamental to guide public health policy. We aimed to estimate the population attributable fraction of modifiable risk factors of dementia among adults from a nationwide epidemiological study. Methods We used the public database of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) to calculate the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) for ten risk factors, including education level, hearing loss, hypertension, alcohol consumption, obesity, active smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, and diabetes. PAF was estimated for this sample after accounting for the communality of each risk factor. Findings The ten preventable risk factors for dementia accounted for 50 center dot 5% of the Population Attributable Fraction in Brazil. Hearing loss (14 center dot 2%), physical inactivity (11 center dot 2%), and hypertension (10 center dot 4%) accounted for the highest PAF among all the risk factors. Considerable variation in the relative contribution of the different risk factors was found in different regions. Interpretation This study might provide an opportunity to change the impact of dementia in Brazil. By targeting modifiable risk factors of dementia, the health of individuals in Brazil might be considerably improved. Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

,No,"Rationale and objective: The incidence of prostate cancer has increased in Central and South America (CSA) in the last few decades. We describe the geographical patterns and trends of prostate cancer in CSA. Methods: We obtained regional and national-level cancer incidence data from 48 population-based registries in 13 countries and nation-wide cancer deaths from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries. We estimated world population age-standardized incidence (ASR) and mortality (ASMR) rates per 100,000 person-years for 2003-2007 and the estimated annual percent change (EAPC) to describe time trends. Results: Prostate cancer was the most common cancer diagnosis and one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among males in most CSA countries. From 2003-2007, ASRs varied between countries (6-fold) and within countries (Brazil: 3-6-fold). French Guyana (147.1) and Brazil (91.4) had the highest ASRs whereas Mexico (28.9) and Cuba (24.3) had the lowest. ASMRs varied by 4-fold. Belize, Uruguay and Cuba (24.128.9) had the highest ASMRs while Peru, Nicaragua, and El Salvador (6.8-9.7) had the lowest. In Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Costa Rica prostate cancer incidence increased by 2.8-4.8% annually whereas mortality remained stable between 1997 and 2008. Conclusion: The geographic and temporal variation of prostate cancer rates observed in CSA may in part reflect differences in diagnostic and registration practices, healthcare access, treatment and death certification, and public awareness. The incidence of prostate cancer is expected to increase given recent early detection activities and increased public awareness; however, the impact of these factors on mortality remains to be elucidated.

Not an open db,No,"Objectives: To determine the relative frequency and prognosis value of proteinuria in hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) due to Andes virus. Methods: This observational analytical study prospectively obtained data from patients admitted to 12 health centers in nine Chilean cities between 2001 and 2018. Only patients with confirmed Andes virus HCPS and laboratory characterization that included qualitative proteinuria determination at admission were considered. Results: The database involved 175 patients, 95 of them had a measurement of urine protein at the time of hospital admission. They were mainly male (71%) and the median age was 35 [22-47] years. Median duration of the febrile prodromal time was 5 [4-7] days. Hospital length of stay and hospital mortality rate were 10 [7-14] days and 21.1%, respectively. Seventy-three patients (77%) were identified with proteinuria at admission, which was associated with increased mortality rate (26% versus 5%, p = 0.036) and the relative risk was 1.3 [1.1-1.6], p = 0.002. Conclusions: Proteinuria is a frequent finding in patients with HCPS, which is associated with a higher mortality rate. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Review,No,"Introduction Considering the limitations that disabled persons experience, our understanding of caring for these people has evolved over time worldwide. Because nursing care is dependent on the choices made by patients, nurses can play an emancipatory role by empowering patients with disabilities to become the primary agent in their rehabilitation. Objective was to conduct a range analysis protocol proposing the mapping of conceptual elements for a nursing care model based on the autonomy of disabled persons. Methods and analysis A protocol was developed in corporating insights from recent innovations and applying the scope review method of Arksey and O'Malley as a reference using their scoping review methodology as a guide. For the construction of research guiding question, the patient, intervention, comparison and outcomes strategy was adapted. Considerable research in online databases (14) from 2000 to 2018 will be integrated by bibliographical research. Proceed a consult in the Annals of the Brazilian Congress of Nursing, Brazilian Nursing Association and Portuguese Rehabilitation Nursing Association, as well as professional Portuguese and Brazilian nursing legislation. The entire reference list of the covered studies searched manually to detect considerable additional studies. In addition to these searches, stakeholders, including nurse experts in the rehabilitation field and disabled persons, will be requested and included. Ethics and dissemination This study does not require ethical approval because it is a review and collection of data on publicly available materials. The results of this research will be published in a relevant journal on the subject of rehabilitation and presented at international scientific events in the area of rehabilitation nursing.

,No,"In addition to increasing linear growth, improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important endpoint in the treatment of short statured youth. Hence, condition-specific psychometric valid instruments that adequately assess HRQOL are needed. We aimed to confirmatorily examine the psychometric performance of the Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth (QoLISSY) questionnaire used in a previously reported prospective randomized open-label trial. This trial compared treatment of idiopathic short stature (ISS) in 76 adolescent males with either oral aromatase inhibitors (AIs), subcutaneous daily growth hormone (GH) or a combination treatment (AI/GH) for at least 2 years, demonstrating improvements in HRQOL with the GH and AI/GH interventions. HRQOL was assessed from the child's and parent's perspectives with the short stature-specific QoLISSY and the generic KIDSCREEN questionnaires before and 24 months into treatment. Scale scores and psychometric properties were examined regarding reliability and validity of the QoLISSY questionnaire using the dataset from the published trial. The QoLISSY questionnaire showed high internal consistency and satisfactory criterion, convergent and known-groups validity. Scale scores were evenly distributed with no major floor or ceiling effects. Responsiveness analyses suggest that the QoLISSY questionnaire detects significant changes in HRQOL after 2 years of treatment with growth-promoting therapies in children with short stature from both the child's and parent's perspectives. The QoLISSY questionnaire is a psychometrically sound, reliable and valid instrument that can explore the experiences associated with short stature, track HRQOL changes over time and in response to treatment, and highlight HRQOL domains that can be improved through intervention. ©2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Psychometric performance of the Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth (QoLISSY) questionnaire in a randomized open-label comparator trial in idiopathic short stature,"Bloemeke J., Balacano Valdez R., Mauras N., Mericq V., Ross J., Permuy J., Quitmann J., Bullinger M.",2019,Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism,,,,,,,3,10.1515/jpem-2019-0137,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073020050&doi=10.1515%2fjpem-2019-0137&partnerID=40&md5=580ecd9daad009ef20a1879954bba163,"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, Institute for Medical Psychology, Martinistraße 52, Hamburg, 20246, Germany; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, Institute for Medical Psychology, Hamburg, Germany; Center for Dental and Oral Medicine, Polyclinic of Prosthetic Dentistry, University Clinic Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; Division of Endocrinology, Nemours Children's Health System, Jacksonville, FL, United States; Division of Endocrinology, University of Santiago, Santiago, Chile; Division of Endocrinology, Nemours Children's Health System, Philadelphia, PA, United States","Bloemeke, J., University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, Institute for Medical Psychology, Martinistraße 52, Hamburg, 20246, Germany; Balacano Valdez, R., University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, Institute for Medical Psychology, Hamburg, Germany, Center for Dental and Oral Medicine, Polyclinic of Prosthetic Dentistry, University Clinic Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; Mauras, N., Division of Endocrinology, Nemours Children's Health System, Jacksonville, FL, United States; Mericq, V., Division of Endocrinology, University of Santiago, Santiago, Chile; Ross, J., Division of Endocrinology, Nemours Children's Health System, Philadelphia, PA, United States; Permuy, J., Division of Endocrinology, Nemours Children's Health System, Jacksonville, FL, United States; Quitmann, J., University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, Institute for Medical Psychology, Hamburg, Germany; Bullinger, M., University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, Institute for Medical Psychology, Hamburg, Germany",adolescents; aromatase inhibitors; growth hormone; idiopathic short stature; patient-reported outcomes; quality of life; sensitivity to change,adolescent; body height; child; Chile; comparative study; controlled study; follow up; growth disorder; human; male; prognosis; psychology; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; United States; Adolescent; Body Height; Child; Chile; Follow-Up Studies; Growth Disorders; Humans; Male; Prognosis; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States,adolescents;aromatase inhibitors;growth hormone;idiopathic short stature;patient-reported outcomes;quality of life;sensitivity to change;adolescent;body height;child;Chile;comparative study;controlled study;follow up;growth disorder;human;male;prognosis;psychology;psychometry;questionnaire;randomized controlled trial;United States;Follow-Up Studies;Growth Disorders;Humans;Psychometrics;Surveys and Questionnaires,"Bloemeke, J.; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistraße 52, Germany; email: j.bloemeke@uke.de",,,,,,De Gruyter,0334018X,,JPEMF,31557127,English,J.

 Insulin volume and expenditure data were obtained in official administrative databases and in the Electronic System of the Information Service to Citizens,Yes,"Background: From 2006 to 2017, the Brazilian federal government provided free of charge traditional insulins for diabetes treatment. This involved public tendering by the Department of Health Logistics of the Ministry of Health (DLOG-MOH) and the reimbursement after direct contracting for supply with commercial private retailers (Brazilian Popular Pharmacy Program — PFPB). Objective: We aim to describe the budget of the Brazilian federal government committed to for the acquisition of insulin, as well as corresponding prices and treatment availability from 2009 to 2017. Methods: Insulin volume and expenditure data were obtained in official administrative databases and in the Electronic System of the Information Service to Citizens. Data were analyzed according to the total provision by the federal government, DLOG-MOH and PFPB. Moreover, data were presented according to insulin type. Volumes were calculated in number of defined daily doses (DDD)/1,000 inhabitants/day. Results: Budgetary commitments due to insulin over nine years amounted to U$1,027 billion in 2017, with an approximate average of U$114.1 million per year. DLOG-MOH was the main insulin provider, despite the increase in PFPB provision along period. DLOG-MOH and PFBP together provided an average of 6.08 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day for nine years. Average prices in PFPB were higher than those in the DLOG series, with a downward trend over the years, narrowing to 2.7 times in 2017, when compared to 2009. Conclusions: Brazil evidenced a moderately sustainable and effective, albeit imperfect, policy for public provision of traditional insulins in the period preceding mandatory free supply of insulin analogues. Future studies must address treatment availability and financial sustainability in the new scenario. © 2020, Assocaicao Brasileira de Pos, Gradacao em Saude Coletiva.

,No,"Understanding how urban nature is important to the public can broaden management objectives and give citizens a say in how nature is managed in the places where they live. However, studies on the topic do not usually integrate multiple research methods: and case studies, or have an opportunity to reflect on an understanding of the value-elicitation process, which is vital for strengthening future research. This article synthesizes multiple qualitative and quantitative research studies that focused on developing an understanding of how the public values the urban forest. Investigating urban-forest public values provides opportunities to understand how the public assigns importance to urban nature in a context where the benefits of nature to humans are less tangible. The studies took place in four Canadian and three Colombian cities, and elicited values from 1289 participants and respondents with the use of field tours, personal diaries, focus groups, photo-elicitation, interviews, and side-walk interception surveys. The synthesis presented here merged the value codes from all case studies to develop a general framework of urban forest public values, and analysed the relationship between the value codes, case studies, and research methods, using qualitative and quantitative meta-analysis techniques. By integrating these rich data sets, we reveal the complex structure of the aesthetic, ecological, economic, environmental, health, psychological, and socio-cultural ideas that these members of the public associate with the urban forest. The quantitative research methods in our studies mostly elicited aesthetic and environmental values, while the qualitative methods elicited all types of values, while enriching descriptions of psycho-social and natural-ecological values. Future research on public values associated with nature can be strengthened by deepening the natural experience of participants, and by using open-ended and collective value-elicitation mechanisms. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Public values associated with urban forests: Synthesis of findings and lessons learned from emerging methods and cross-cultural case studies,"Ordonez C., Beckley T., Duinker P.N., Sinclair A.J.",2017,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,25,,,74,84,,25,10.1016/j.ufug.2017.05.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019867487&doi=10.1016%2fj.ufug.2017.05.002&partnerID=40&md5=f3b9cc568c55460632ac32ed28a3a23b,"Geography & Environmental Studies, Ryerson University, Canada; Faculty of Forestry, University of New Brunswick, Canada; Natural Resources Institute, University of Manitoba, Canada; School for Resource and Environmental Studies, Dalhousie University, Canada","Ordóñez, C., Geography & Environmental Studies, Ryerson University, Canada; Beckley, T., Faculty of Forestry, University of New Brunswick, Canada; Duinker, P.N., School for Resource and Environmental Studies, Dalhousie University, Canada; Sinclair, A.J., Natural Resources Institute, University of Manitoba, Canada",Case study research; Ecosystem values; Public opinion; Public participation; Qualitative research; Social science research methods; Survey research,environmental values; local participation; meta-analysis; perception; public attitude; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; research method; urban forestry; Brazil; Canada; Colombo [Parana]; Parana [Brazil],Case study research;Ecosystem values;Public opinion;Public participation;Qualitative research;Social science research methods;Survey research;environmental values;local participation;meta-analysis;perception;public attitude;qualitative analysis;quantitative analysis;research method;urban forestry;Brazil;Canada;Colombo [Parana];Parana [Brazil],"Duinker, P.N.; School for Resource and Environmental Studies, Canada; email: peter.duinker@dal.ca",,,,,,Elsevier GmbH,16188667,,,,English,Urban For.

,No,"High-throughput sequencing methods are becoming an essential tool in disease management programs. Unfortunately, the implementation of these techniques in developing countries can be hindered by a limited availability of well-trained bioinformaticians and/or high-performance computing centers that can process and analyze the data with reliability and speed. In this work we present a stand-alone plant virus detection pipeline (PVDP) optimized for the surveillance of potato viruses but also useful in other plant hosts. This open source pipeline runs under Python and includes a curated database of plant viruses in addition to an R script for presenting results as a user-friendly html report. The pipeline scripts are freely-available in GitHub, can be executed locally under LINUX, macOS or Windows, and does not require data submission to third-parties or access to high performance computing centers. The pipeline was calibrated using twelve previously obtained potato datasets and validated with new samples collected in Solanum tuberosum and S. phureja fields from eastern Antioquia (Colombia). The plant virus detection pipeline revealed high infection levels of PVY (1678.4 RPM) and lower levels of PMTV (1.2-2 RPM) infecting S. tuberosum. In S. phureja, the pipeline detected high infection levels of PVX, PVS and PVV (RPM > 2044) and lower levels of PMTV, PVY, and PYVV (RPM <82.1). Results also suggest the probable infection of S. phureja by pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) and by a putative unidentified potyvirus. Hopefully, this plant virus detection pipeline will facilitate the implementation of HTS methods in developing countries, such as Colombia, where there is an urgent need to improve the current plant and seed health standards.",PVDP: A portable open source pipeline for detection of plant viruses in RNAseq data.

The responsibility of the Hospital Food and Nutrition Service (HFNS) is not always well defined, despite efforts to establish guidelines for patient clinical nutrition practice. This study describes the elaboration of an Instrument for Evaluation of Food and Nutritional Care (IEFNC) aimed at directing the actions of the Hospital Food and Nutrition Service. This instrument was qualified by means of a comparative analysis of the categories related to hospital food and nutritional care, published in the literature. Elaboration of the IEFNC comprised the following stages: (a) a survey of databases and documents for selection of the categories to be used in nutrition care evaluation, (b) a study of the institutional procedures for nutrition practice at two Brazilian hospitals, in order to provide a description of the sequence of actions that should be taken by the HFNS as well as other services participating in nutrition care, (c) design of the IEFNC based on the categories published in the literature, adapted to the sequence of actions observed in the routines of the hospitals under study, (d) application of the questionnaire at two different hospitals that was mentioned in the item (b), in order to assess the time spent on its application, the difficulties in phrasing the questions, and the coverage of the instrument, and (e) finalization of the instrument. The IEFNC consists of 50 open and closed questions on two areas of food and nutritional care in hospital: inpatient nutritional care and food service quality. It deals with the characterization and structure of hospitals and their HFNS, the actions concerning the patients' nutritional evaluation and monitoring, the meal production system, and the hospital diets.

Three SUS administrative databases were integrated,Yes,"Introduction: Antipsychotics are widely prescribed for patients with schizophrenia. The Brazilian public health system provides these patients free of charge to patients and it is pertinent to evaluate their benefits. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of olanzapine and risperidone in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in the real-world and assessing risk factors for their discontinuation through a national non-concurrent cohort with 16 years of follow-up. Methods: Three SUS administrative databases were integrated by deterministic-probabilistic linkage. After patients were matched (1:1) for psychiatric hospitalization, year of receiving the antipsychotic, sex, and age, considering either olanzapine or risperidone at study entry. Kaplan-Meier was used to estimate the cumulative probabilities of discontinuation of treatment and associated factors were identified. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: 3416 pairs of patients were included. Olanzapine had a longer time until discontinuation of treatment (p = 0.021), and risperidone had a higher risk of discontinuation (p = 0.021).

,No,"Background The CARD study demonstrated superiority of cabazitaxel over abiraterone/enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who received prior docetaxel and progressed <= 12 months on the alternative androgen-receptor-targeted agent (ARTA). The objective was to compare characteristics and treatment patterns of patients from a real-world dataset with the CARD population. Methods Real-world data were collected from Medimix Live Tracker(TM), a retrospective, global oncology database of healthcare professional-reported electronic patient medical forms (2001-2019), with data from patients from Europe, USA, Brazil and Japan. The database contained patient, tumor and treatment information for 12,140 patients who received >= 1 line of treatment for mCRPC. A CARD-like cohort included patients treated with docetaxel, prior abiraterone/enzalutamide and cabazitaxel. Results A large proportion of patients received >= 2 lines of ARTA (35.1%) with 42% of patients who received a first-line ARTA receiving another ARTA in second line. Of the total patients, 452 were eligible for the CARD-like cohort. Median age of the CARD-like cohort was comparable to CARD (73 vs 70 years). The CARD-like cohort had unfavorable disease characteristics vs CARD: ECOG PS >= 2 (45% vs 4.7%); metastasis at diagnosis (46% vs 38%) and Gleason 8-10 (65% vs 57%). More patients in the CARD-like cohort received ARTA before docetaxel (48% vs 39%) and received the first ARTA for >12 months (30% vs 17%) compared with CARD. Despite more patients in the CARD-like cohort receiving the lower 20 mg/m(2) dose of cabazitaxel (55% vs 21%), cabazitaxel treatment duration was similar (21.9 vs 22.0 weeks). Conclusions Sequential use of ARTA was frequent.

"In a Brazilian leprosy national referral center, 222 patients with leprosy or other dermatological conditions were included, and the 1229 collected skin images and 585 sets of metadata are stored in an open-source dataset for other researchers to exploit",Yes,"Background Leprosy is an infectious disease that mostly affects underserved populations. Although it has been largely eliminated, still about 200'000 new patients are diagnosed annually. In the absence of a diagnostic test, clinical diagnosis is often delayed, potentially leading to irreversible neurological damage and its resulting stigma, as well as continued transmission. Accelerating diagnosis could significantly contribute to advancing global leprosy elimination. Digital and Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven technology has shown potential to augment health workers abilities in making faster and more accurate diagnosis, especially when using images such as in the fields of dermatology or ophthalmology. That made us start the quest for an AI-driven diagnosis assistant for leprosy, based on skin images. Methods Here we describe the accuracy of an AI-enabled image-based diagnosis assistant for leprosy, called AI4Leprosy, based on a combination of skin images and clinical data, collected following a standardized process. In a Brazilian leprosy national referral center, 222 patients with leprosy or other dermatological conditions were included, and the 1229 collected skin images and 585 sets of metadata are stored in an open-source dataset for other researchers to exploit. Findings We used this dataset to test whether a CNN-based AI algorithm could contribute to leprosy diagnosis and employed three AI models, testing images and metadata both independently and in combination. AI modeling indicated that the most important clinical signs are thermal sensitivity loss, nodules and papules, feet paresthesia, number of lesions and gender, but also scaling surface and pruritus that were negatively associated with leprosy. Using elastic-net logistic regression provided a high classification accuracy (90%) and an area under curve (AUC) of 96.46% for leprosy diagnosis. Interpretation Future validation of these models is underway, gathering larger datasets from populations of different skin types and collecting images with smartphone cameras to mimic real world settings. We hope that the results of our research will lead to clinical solutions that help accelerate global leprosy elimination. Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

,No,"Objectives: To present the data available and discuss the progress, current advances and challenges of the initiatives, current policies and guidance implemented by the Health and Education Ministries in Brazil to target transformation of health teaching in order to improve the health care offered by the Brazilian National Health System. Study design: Literature review. Methods: Documentary analysis and review of articles identified in a search of electronic databases, along with reports and documents acquired from the Health and Education Ministries between 1988 and 2013. Results: This study identified some important initiatives, including the Programme for the Encouragement of Curricular Changes in Medical Courses (PROMED), implemented in 2002 for medical courses alone. Inspired by PROMED and covering a wider range of graduate courses, the National Programme for Re-orientation of Health Professionals was implemented in 2005. This initiative launched its third edition in 2012, covering 14 health professional areas. Another relevant innovation was the National Policy of Permanent Health Education, implemented in 2007, with the goal of transforming public health services into a locus of teaching-learning through working. The Unified Health System Open University was also implemented. Conclusions: There is general concern and ongoing actions involving different sectors in Brazil in an attempt to improve the health of the Brazilian population in the future.

,No,"Domestic violence by husbands against their wives has increased considerably in recent years to become a serious public health problem, particularly because of the grave psychological and physical sequelae which may result from such treatment. In this study, we examined the ways in which women victims of domestic violence viewed or ""represented"" themselves, their partners, their marriages and domestic violence itself. This ""representation"" generally included a written account of the motives for such violence and associated complaints, as well as comments on related sensations, memories and thoughts experienced by the victim. Such knowledge could form a useful database for preventing similar incidents in the future by providing important information on the victims insights and emotions about domestic violence. This, in turn, could allow earlier, more direct intervention in such cases. For this study, 480 questionnaires consisting of 60 open and closed questions were distributed to women living in the region of Campinas in the State of São Paulo. Of these, 117 were returned completed after three months. Analysis of these forms showed that women who had experienced domestic violence held very negative views of their partners and their marriages, and this was accompanied by a sense of hopelessness and resentment about their situation. They also generally held a low-self esteem mixed with feelings of sadness and increasing irritation, characteristic dysthymic symptoms. These findings suggest that psychotherapy with or without pharmacological intervention could help these women in their search for more effective means of resolving their conflicts and avoiding further aggression.",Representations of the domestic violence by 117 women of Campinas-Brazil [Representações da violência conjugal de 117 mulheres de Campinas-Brasil],"Cabral M.A.A., Brancalhone P.G.",2000,Jornal Brasileiro de Psiquiatria,49,8,,277,285,,1,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0347741706&partnerID=40&md5=3c4baa5b86e974e2ef70c255a5693328,,"Cabral, M.A.A.; Brancalhone, P.G.",Domestic violence; Dysthymic disorder; Family; Representations; Women,,Domestic violence;Dysthymic disorder;Family;Representations;Women,,,,,,,,472085,,JBPSA,,Portuguese,J.

,No,"Background: Genome survey sequences (GSS) offer a preliminary global view of a genome since, unlike ESTs, they cover coding as well as non-coding DNA and include repetitive regions of the genome. A more precise estimation of the nature, quantity and variability of repetitive sequences very early in a genome sequencing project is of considerable importance, as such data strongly influence the estimation of genome coverage, library quality and progress in scaffold construction. Also, the elimination of repetitive sequences from the initial assembly process is important to avoid errors and unnecessary complexity. Repetitive sequences are also of interest in a variety of other studies, for instance as molecular markers. Results: We designed and implemented a straightforward pipeline called ReRep, which combines bioinformatics tools for identifying repetitive structures in a GSS dataset. In a case study, we first applied the pipeline to a set of 970 GSSs, sequenced in our laboratory from the human pathogen Leishmania braziliensis, the causative agent of leishmaniosis, an important public health problem in Brazil. We also verified the applicability of ReRep to new sequencing technologies using a set of 454-reads of an Escheria coli. The behaviour of several parameters in the algorithm is evaluated and suggestions are made for tuning of the analysis. Conclusion: The ReRep approach for identification of repetitive elements in GSS datasets proved to be straightforward and efficient. Several potential repetitive sequences were found in a L. braziliensis GSS dataset generated in our laboratory, and further validated by the analysis of a more complete genomic dataset from the EMBL and Sanger Centre databases. ReRep also identified most of the E. coli K12 repeats prior to assembly in an example dataset obtained by automated sequencing using 454 technology. The parameters controlling the algorithm behaved consistently and may be tuned to the properties of the dataset, in particular to the length of sequencing reads and the genome coverage.

,No,"Background: Several interventions for tuberculosis (TB) control have been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) over the past decade. These include isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for HIV-infected individuals and household contacts of infectious TB patients, diagnostic algorithms for rule-in or rule-out of smear-negative pulmonary TB, and programmatic treatment for multidrug-resistant TB. There is no systematically collected data on the type of evidence that is publicly available to guide the scale-up of these interventions in low- and middle-income countries. We investigated the availability of published evidence on their effectiveness, delivery, and cost-effectiveness that policy makers need for scaling-up these interventions at country level. Methods and Findings: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and several regional databases were searched for studies published from 1 January 1990 through 31 March 2012 that assessed health outcomes, delivery aspects, or cost-effectiveness for any of these interventions in low- or middle-income countries. Selected studies were evaluated for their objective(s), design, geographical and institutional setting, and generalizability. Studies reporting health outcomes were categorized as primarily addressing efficacy or effectiveness of the intervention. These criteria were used to draw landscapes of published research. We identified 59 studies on IPT in HIV infection, 14 on IPT in household contacts, 44 on rule-in diagnosis, 19 on rule-out diagnosis, and 72 on second-line treatment. Comparative effectiveness studies were relatively few (n = 9) and limited to South America and sub-Saharan Africa for IPT in HIV-infection, absent for IPT in household contacts, and rare for second-line treatment (n = 3). Evaluations of diagnostic and screening algorithms were more frequent (n = 19) but geographically clustered and mainly of non-comparative design. Fifty-four studies evaluated ways of delivering these interventions, and nine addressed their cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: There are substantial gaps in published evidence for scale-up for five WHO-recommended TB interventions settings at country level, which for many countries possibly precludes program-wide implementation of these interventions. There is a strong need for rigorous operational research studies to be carried out in programmatic settings to inform on best use of existing and new interventions in TB control.

,No,"The work analyzed the effect of Public Consultations (PC) and their contributions to the recommendations of the National Commis-sion for the Incorporation of Technologies (CO-NITEC). This is a descriptive and retrospective study with a qualitative-quantitative approach using a secondary data source of public access, between 2012 and 2017. A database was deve-loped to characterize the PC of medications and their contributions, which allowed the identifica-tion of cases of reversals between the preliminary and final recommendation of CONITEC. We analyzed the contributions in cases of reversal for characterization of argumentative axes and type of basis. Of the 307 demands for incorporation of medications, 205 went through PC, with 23,894 contributions. The reversal of the recommenda-tions occurred in 9% of the open PC (15 medica-tions), all in the sense of non-incorporation for incorporation. Main argumentative axes dealt with clinical benefits and minor adverse events, with prevalence of the submission of clinical expe-riences and opinions.

,No,"The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological characteristics and clinical outcome of children hospitalized with COVID-19 and identify the risk factors for severe disease. All hospital admissions of pediatric patients between March and December 2020 in the southern region of Brazil were reviewed and the patients positive for RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. This region encompasses a population of over 2.8 million children and adolescents. Data were extracted from a national database that includes all cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome requiring hospitalization in Brazil. A total of 288 hospitalizations (51.3% female) with a median age of 3 years (interquartile range 0-12 years) were identified. Of these, 38.9% had chronic medical conditions, 55.6% required some form of supplementary oxygen, and 30.2% were admitted to an intensive care unit. There were 17 deaths (5.9%) related to COVID-19. Age less than 30 days was significantly associated with increased odds of critical illness (OR 9.52, 95% CI 3.01-30.08), as well as the presence of one chronic condition (OR 5.08 95%CI 2.78-9.33) or two or more chronic conditions (OR 6.60, 95% CI 3.17-13.74). Conclusion: Age under 30 days old and presence of chronic conditions were strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes in Brazilian children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings could help local public health authorities to develop specific policies to protect this more vulnerable group of children. (c) 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia.

"Retrospective study using open-access databases were published by the Peruvian Ministry of Health. Databases of genomic sequencing, death, COVID-19 cases, hospitalization and ICU, and vaccination were used",Yes,"Objectives: Peru has had the highest death toll from the pandemic worldwide; however, it is not clear what the effects of the different variants on these outcomes are. The study aimed to evaluate the risk of death, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates of COVID-19 according to the SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in Peru from March 2020-February 2022. Methods: Retrospective study using open-access databases were published by the Peruvian Ministry of Health. Databases of genomic sequencing, death, COVID-19 cases, hospitalization and ICU, and vaccination were used. Crude and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regressions with clustered variances were modeled to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of outcomes by variant. Results: Lambda variant had the highest risk of death (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.37-2.68), whereas the Delta variant had the lowest risk (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31-0.82). Mu variant had the highest risk of hospitalization (HR: 2.39, 95% CI 1.56-3.67), Omicron the lowest (HR 0.45, 95%CI 0.23-0.90), and Gamma had the highest ICU admission rate (HR 1.95, 95%CI 1.40-2.71).

,No,"Objectives: minimally invasive inguinal hernia repair has proven advantages over open procedures including less pain and earlier return to normal activity. Robotic surgery adds ergonomics, a three-dimensional high definition camera and articulating instruments overcoming some laparoscopic limitations. We aimed to report the outcomes of the early experience of over 97 robotic inguinal hernia repairs performed by a referred surgical group in Brazil. Methods: a review of a prospective mantined database was conducted in patients submitted to robotic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal hernia repairs between March 2016 and February 2020. Descriptive statistics were performed. Surgical outcomes data and patient follow-ups are reported. Results: retrospective chart review identified 97 patients submitted to robotic TAPP inguinal hernia repair. Mean age was 36.4 years, with median BMI of 26.9 kg/m2. Mean console time was 58 min (range 40-150) and patients were discharged within 24 hours of their stay in a majority of cases. Mesh was placed in all procedures and there were no conversion rates. Complications were low grade and no recurrence was seen after a mean follow-up of 642 days. Conclusion: this study represents to-date the first brazilian case series of robotic TAPP inguinal hernia repair. Our results encourage that robotic assisted TAPP inguinal hernia repair appears to be technically feasible and safe in experienced hands, with good outcomes achieving high health-related quality of life and low recurrence rates in the short and long term. © 2021, Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes.

,No,"Purpose: Health information systems in Brazil have been designed and developed in a heterogeneous manner based on local regional characteristics, resulting in a lack of health information integrity. In this context, the Brazilian Ministry of Health pointed out the need for interoperability solutions of health information systems, noting the importance of integration with national databases and alignment with Brazilian data protection laws. Therefore, this paper presents Sabiá, a platform for authentication, authorization, and data delivery based on user consent for health information systems in Brazil. Methods: Sabiá’s architecture is designed to achieve the following requirements: (R1) Provide a Federated Identity; (R2) Be a Federated Resource Manager; (R3) Collect user data from different information systems; and (R4) Deliver user data to systems based on user consent. Sabiá consists of three main components: (1) Sabiá Authorization Server, responsible for implementing Open Authentication; (2) Sabiá Collector, responsible for collecting data from different information systems; and (3) Sabiá Resource Server, responsible for delivering data previously authorized by the user to the systems. Results: After analyzing historical data, R4 functionality was selected to be submitted to performance testing because it is the process that most affects overall system performance. The tests aimed at analyzing Sabiá’s behavior in the heaviest scenario based on historical data. Conclusion: The results showed no flaws and indicated system stability and consistency, in which the user perceives a system reaction instantaneous, whose response time averages remained below 100 ms. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.","Sabiá: an authentication, authorization, and user data delivery architecture based on user consent for health information systems in Brazil","de Paiva Marques Carvalho T., de Paiva J.C., de Medeiros Valentim R.A., Silva C.B.P., de Lima D.F., Silva E.C.",2020,Research on Biomedical Engineering,36,2,,197,202,,1,10.1007/s42600-020-00058-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082721401&doi=10.1007%2fs42600-020-00058-8&partnerID=40&md5=a7a1e1ec189db497fa9aebaf666fa4d0,"Laboratory for Technological Innovation in Healthcare (LAIS), Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), R.

,No,"Mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones, have continuously modified people's habits and relationships in various areas of their lives. Currently, the ease of access to these devices has caused a growing number of people to have one or more devices and know how to handle them. The relationship between mobile technologies and education is growing in the teaching-learning scenario. Therefore, mobile learning becomes a reality, allowing access to educational content and knowledge sharing with autonomy, regardless of economic, social and geographical factors, through mobile interaction platforms. In this context, institutions that work with Distance Education (DE) need to update and adapt their processes to these innovations. Considering this trend, Saite Group has built, in partnership with the Open University of Brazilian National Health System (UNA-SUS) associated with the Federal University of Maranhao (UFMA), a virtual library that enables fast and free access to its contents using mobile devices: Saite Store. This tool enables the dissemination of knowledge with quality. Its content is mostly aimed at health professionals, since the training of workers in this area imposes the need for permanent qualification and innovation of educational practices, in a dynamic and systematized way. Currently, Saite Store already has more than 200 e-books distributed in 12 thematic areas. It is used by more than 21,860 users, proving to be useful in the democratization of the contents offered by UNA-SUS/UFMA. With the expansion of the tool's use, the institution invested in a new version to provide a better experience to its users. A new database architecture has been implemented for the server environment and the user's mobile device. With the operation of this data structure, the use of the offline application was allowed, since a mirror of the service is provisioned at the client. In addition to the change in navigability, the new Saite Store also has a greater capacity of books storage than the previous version, mainly because of the improvement in the application's speed. The new version has optimization algorithm for data provision and only once a day a mirror of the data that the application needs is generated. Two algorithms are used on the server: one to create a file with all available information and another only for new information. Another interesting change is that the new Saite Store brings a more flexible design than the previous one and now the student has a tool more compatible and adaptable to different devices. It was sought to understand how the user uses his device and then a version that is better suited to reading was built - be it horizontal for tablets or vertical for smartphones. Specific versions were also developed for smartphones, adapted to the guidelines of each of the operating systems (iOS, Android, and Windows). According to the Google publisher (Play Store), the application's acceptance in approved devices has reached 100%. In this paper, we dealt with the details of the version for Android devices. This paper aims to perform a detailing of the Saite Store new version, showing its operation and the technological implementations carried out. Finally, the importance of performing updates in the application is highlighted, considering its great potential for use by more than twenty thousand users.",SAITE STORE 2.0: EXPERIENCE REPORT ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VIRTUAL LIBRARY'S NEW VERSION,"de Oliveira, A.E.F., Haddad, A.E., de Assis, K.M.M., Lima, C.S.D.E., Almeida, A.M.L., Silva, D.G., Spinillo, C.G.",2018,EDULEARN18: 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,,,,720,727,8,0,,,"[Figueiredo de Oliveira, A.

,No,"Introduction: Venezuela and Colombia both adopted measures of containment early in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Venezuela's ongoing humanitarian crisis has decimated its health care system, and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border, and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region. Methods: We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages 'Pangolin' tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference. Results: We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes. Additionally, three mutations (R203K/G204R substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome. Conclusions: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil, consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns. The presence of mutations associated with increased infectivity in the 3 Venezuelan genomes we report and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from neighboring borders areas may pose additional challenges for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the complex epidemiological landscape in Latin American countries.

data of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV-2 infection or other etiologic agents (OEA) among Brazilian Indigenous peoples during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from a Brazilian Ministry of Health open-access database,Yes,"Background Indigenous peoples are vulnerable to pandemics, including to the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, since it causes high mortality and specially, the loss of elderly Indigenous individuals. Methods The epidemiological data of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV-2 infection or other etiologic agents (OEA) among Brazilian Indigenous peoples during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from a Brazilian Ministry of Health open-access database to perform an observational study. Considering only Indigenous individuals diagnosed with SARS by COVID-19, the epidemiology data were also evaluated as risk of death. The type of sample collection for virus screening, demographic profile, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical evolution were evaluated. The primary outcome was considered the death in the Brazilian Indigenous individuals and the secondary outcome, the characteristics of Brazilian Indigenous infected by SARS-CoV-2 or OEA, as the need for intensive care unit admission or the need for mechanical ventilation support. The statistical analysis was done using Logistic Regression Model. Alpha of 0.05. Findings A total of 3,122 cases of Indigenous individuals with SARS in Brazil were reported during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these, 1,994 were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 730/1,816 (40.2%) of them died. The death rate among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 was three-fold increased when compared to the group of individuals with OEA. Several symptoms (myalgia, loss of smell, and sore throat) and comorbidities (cardiopathy, systemic arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) were more prevalent in the COVID-19 group when compared to Indigenous individuals with OEA. Similar profile was observed considering the risk of death among the Indigenous individuals with COVID-19 who presented several symptoms (oxygen saturation < 95%, dyspnea, and respiratory distress) and comorbidities (renal disorders, cardiopathy, and diabetes mellitus). The multivariate analysis was significant in differentiating between the COVID-19-positive and non-COVID-19 patients [X-2 ((7))=65.187; P-value< 0.001]. Among the patients' features, the following contributed in relation to the diagnosis of COVID-19: age [>= 43 years-old [y.o.]; OR=1.984 (95%CI=1.480-2.658)]; loss of smell [OR=2.373 (95%CI=1.461-3.854)]; presence of previous respiratory disorders [OR=0.487; 95%CI=0.287-0.824)]; and fever [OR=1.445 (95%CI=1.082-1.929)]. Also, the multivariate analysis was able to predict the risk of death [X-2 ((9))=293.694; P-value< 0.001]. Among the patients' features, the following contributed in relation to the risk of death: male gender [OR=1.507 (95%CI=1.010-2.250)]; age [>= 60 y.o.; OR=3.377 (95%CI=2.292-4.974)]; the need for ventilatory support [invasive mechanical ventilation; OR=24.050 (95%CI=12.584-45.962) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation; OR=2.249 (95%CI=1.378-3.671)]; dyspnea [OR=2.053 (95%CI=1.196-3.522)]; oxygen saturation <95% [OR=1.691 (95%CI=1.050-2.723)]; myalgia [OR=0.423 (95%CI=0.191-0.937)]; and the presence of kidney disorders [OR=3.135 (95%CI=1.144-8.539)]. Interpretation The Brazilian Indigenous peoples are in a vulnerable situation during the COVID-19 pandemic and presented an increased risk of death due to COVID-19. Several factors were associated with enhanced risk of death, as male sex, older age (>= 60 y.o.), and need for ventilatory support; also, other factors might help to differentiate SARS by COVID-19 or by OEA, as older age (>= 43 y.o.), loss of smell, and fever.

,No,"This investigation, using a case-control analysis approach on an IUD data set from a less-developed country center, delineated four risk factors in patient characteristics that are associated with severe pain at interval IUD insertion. They are: higher education (≥ seven years), low-parity (1-2 live births), longer open interval (≥ 13 months) between the end of the last pregnancy and insertion, and non-breast feeding at the time of insertion. Adjusted relative risks estimated by odds ratios are 2.1, 2.7, 2.7 and 5.0, respectively. For women with a combination of the above risk factors, they have a further increased (additive in nature) risk of suffering severe insertion pain. Similar analysis was also performed on a developed country center data set for which only the effect of education and parity could be studied; an odds ratio of 5.0 for nulliparity was obtained. The plausibility of these findings as well as their clinical and programmatic implications are discussed. © 1986.",Severe pain at interval IUD insertion: A case-control analysis of patient risk factors,"Chi I.c., Galich L.F., Tauber P.F., Wilkens L.R., Waszak C.S., Siemens A.J., Lippes J.",1986,Contraception,34,5,,483,495,,23,10.1016/0010-7824(86)90057-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023028963&doi=10.1016%2f0010-7824%2886%2990057-0&partnerID=40&md5=578279c7c64b6a7e1d9abe749cdb05ec,"Family Health International, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, United States; APROFAM, Aportado Postal 1004, Guatemala; University Hospitals, Hufelandstrasse 55, 4300 Essen 1, Germany; School of Medicine, State University of New York at Buffalo, Deaconess Hospital, Buffalo, NY 14208, United States","Chi, I.-c., Family Health International, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, United States; Galich, L.F., APROFAM, Aportado Postal 1004, Guatemala; Tauber, P.F., University Hospitals, Hufelandstrasse 55, 4300 Essen 1, Germany; Wilkens, L.R., Family Health International, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, United States; Waszak, C.S., Family Health International, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, United States; Siemens, A.J., Family Health International, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, United States; Lippes, J., School of Medicine, State University of New York at Buffalo, Deaconess Hospital, Buffalo, NY 14208, United States",,"adult; contraception; diagnosis; etiology; female genital system; human; insertion; intrauterine contraceptive device; major clinical study; pain; priority journal; therapy; united states; Acceptor Characteristics; Acceptors; Americas; Breast Feeding; Central America; Contraception; Contraceptive Methods; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Diseases; Economic Factors; Educational Status; Europe; Family Planning; Family Planning Programs; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Germany, Federal Republic Of; Guatemala; Health; Infant Nutrition; Insertion; Iud; Latin America; North America; Northern America; Nutrition; Pain; Parity; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Research Report; Signs And Symptoms; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Treatment; United States; Western Europe; Breast Feeding; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Intrauterine Devices; Pain; Parity; Risk","adult;contraception;diagnosis;etiology;female genital system;human;insertion;intrauterine contraceptive device;major clinical study;pain;priority journal;therapy;united states;Acceptor Characteristics;Acceptors;Americas;Breast Feeding;Central America;Contraceptive Methods;Data Analysis;Demographic Factors;Developed Countries;Developing Countries;Diseases;Economic Factors;Educational Status;Europe;Family Planning;Family Planning Programs;Fertility;Fertility Measurements;Germany, Federal Republic Of;Guatemala;Health;Infant Nutrition;Iud;Latin America;North America;Northern America;Nutrition;Parity;Population;Population Dynamics;Research Methodology;Research Report;Signs And Symptoms;Socioeconomic Factors;Socioeconomic Status;Treatment;Western Europe;Female;Humans;Intrauterine Devices;Risk","Chi, I.-c.; Family Health International, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, United States",,,,,,,107824,,CCPTA,3816232,English,Contraception,Article,Scopus,,2-s2.0-0023028963,,United States;Guatemala;Germany,No email,,,"Chi I.-c., Galich L.F., Tauber P.F., Wilkens L.R., Waszak C.S., Siemens A.J., Lippes J.",,
matching through three databases of the SUS with assessment of liver graft survival,Yes,"Objective: To evaluate factors related to liver graft survival with a focus on immunosuppressive schemes based on calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine). Methodology: This study was carried out through an open cohort constructed by deterministic and probabilistic matching through three databases of the SUS with assessment of liver graft survival from 2000 to 2015 in Brazil. From this first cohort, a second cohort was constructed by pairing 1: 1 to more precisely assess the effect of the immunosuppressive scheme on graft survival. The Kaplan-Meier method and was used to estimate the probability of survival. Cox’s model of proportional risks was used to assess factors related to graft loss. Result: We found 12,687 patients in the Full cohort and 470 patients in the Matched cohort. The overall graft survival rates at 1, 5, 10, and 16 years were 72.6, 63.3, 52.8, and 45.3%, respectively. Patients younger had a longer graft survival than older ones. In the Full cohort, male patients had a higher survival rate than female ones. Therapeutic schemes based on tacrolimus were more prevalent and had a better survival rate when compared to schemes that used cyclosporine. Tacrolimus without association with antiproliferative agents or rapamycin inhibitors was the therapeutic scheme associated with greater survival rate in both cohorts (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.72–0.91), (HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.30–0.85). In addition, white-skinned patients had longer survival rate in both cohorts (HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.50–0.61 and HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.34–0.75). On the other hand, patients who a greater time ratio without using an immunosuppressant had lower graft survival rate (HR = 6.46, 95% CI = 5.05–8.27 and HR = 6.57, 95% CI = 2.66–16.22). Conclusion: This 16-year cohort showed that the older age and the greater time ratio without using an immunosuppressant are risk factors for liver graft loss. White-skinned patients and tacrolimus-based regimens, especially tacrolimus without other immunosuppressants, are factors of better prognosis to the graft. © Copyright © 2020 Nascimento, Gomes, Alvares-Teodoro, Ribeiro, Cherchiglia, Simão-Filho, Acurcio, Sarmento, Gargano and Guerra.",Sixteen-Year Cohort of Liver Transplantation in the National Health System in Brazil: Analysis of Immunosuppression Maintenance Therapies,"Nascimento G.F., Gomes R.M., Alvares-Teodoro J., Ribeiro N.G., Jr., Cherchiglia M.L., Simao-Filho C., Acurcio F.A., Sarmento T.T.R., Gargano L.P., Guerra A.A., Junior",2020,Frontiers in Pharmacology,11,,572043,,,,1,10.3389/fphar.2020.572043,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093833037&doi=10.3389%2ffphar.2020.572043&partnerID=40&md5=004fb73df4d4b95a5f82f1f52c3e23ad,"Department of Social Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; SUS Collaborating Centre–Technology Assessment Excellence in Health, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, College of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Department of Surgery, College of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil","Nascimento, G.F., Department of Social Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Gomes, R.M., Department of Social Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Alvares-Teodoro, J., Department of Social Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, SUS Collaborating Centre–Technology Assessment Excellence in Health, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Ribeiro, N.G., Jr., SUS Collaborating Centre–Technology Assessment Excellence in Health, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Cherchiglia, M.L., Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, College of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Simão-Filho, C., Department of Surgery, College of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Acurcio, F.A., Department of Social Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, SUS Collaborating Centre–Technology Assessment Excellence in Health, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Sarmento, T.T.R., SUS Collaborating Centre–Technology Assessment Excellence in Health, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Gargano, L.P., SUS Collaborating Centre–Technology Assessment Excellence in Health, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Guerra, A.A., Júnior, Department of Social Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, SUS Collaborating Centre–Technology Assessment Excellence in Health, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil",graft survival; calcineurin inhibitor; cyclosporine; immunosuppression; liver transplantation; National Health Service; survival analysis; tacrolimus,cyclosporine; rapamycin; tacrolimus; adult; age; aged; Article; Brazil; cohort analysis; female; follow up; graft failure; graft survival; human; immunosuppressive treatment; liver transplantation; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; open study; overall survival; prognosis; risk factor; survival rate; trend study,graft survival;calcineurin inhibitor;cyclosporine;immunosuppression;liver transplantation;National Health Service;survival analysis;tacrolimus;rapamycin;adult;age;aged;Article;Brazil;cohort analysis;female;follow up;graft failure;human;immunosuppressive treatment;maintenance therapy;major clinical study;male;open study;overall survival;prognosis;risk factor;survival rate;trend study,"Nascimento, G.F.; Department of Social Pharmacy, Belo Horizonte, Brazil

,No,"Background: To evaluate demographic, clinical and pathological characteristics of small renal masses (SRM) (≤ 4 cm) in a Latin-American population provided by LARCG (Latin-American Renal Cancer Group) and analyze predictors of survival, recurrence and metastasis. Methods: A multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of 1523 patients submitted to surgical treatment for non-metastatic SRM from 1979 to 2016. Comparisons between radical (RN) or partial nephrectomy (PN) and young or elderly patients were performed. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests estimated 10-year overall survival. Predictors of local recurrence or metastasis were analyzed by a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: PN and RN were performed in 897 (66%) and 461 (34%) patients. A proportional increase of PN cases from 48.5% (1979-2009) to 75% (after 2009) was evidenced. Stratifying by age, elderly patients (≥ 65 years) had better 10-year OS rates when submitted to PN (83.5%), than RN (54.5%), p = 0.044. This disparity was not evidenced in younger patients. On multivariable model, bilaterality, extracapsular extension and ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) classification ≥3 were predictors of local recurrence. We did not identify significant predictors for distant metastasis in our series. Conclusions: PN is performed in Latin-America in a similar proportion to developed areas and it has been increasing in the last years. Even in elderly individuals, if good functional status, sufficiently fit to surgery, and favorable tumor characteristics, they should be encouraged to perform PN. Intending to an earlier diagnosis of recurrence or distant metastasis, SRM cases with unfavorable characteristics should have a more rigorous follow-up routine. © 2020 The Author(s).","Small renal masses in Latin-American population: Characteristics and prognostic factors for survival, recurrence and metastasis - A multi-institutional study from LARCG database","Mourao T.C., Abreu D., Carvalhal G.F., Gueglio G., Da Costa W.H., Calsavara V.F., Meza-Montoya L., Bengio R.G., Scorticati C., Castillejos-Molina R., Rodriguez-Covarrubias F., Autran-Gomez A.M., Campos-Salcedo J.G., Nolazco A., Ameri C., Zampolli H., Langenhin R., Muguruza D., Machado M.T., Mingote P., Clavijo J., Nogueira L., Clark O., Rovegno A.R., Secin F.P., Decia R., Guimaraes G.C., Glina S., Rodriguez-Faba O., Palou J., Zequi S.C.",2020,BMC Urology,20,1,85,,,,0,10.1186/s12894-020-00649-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087531592&doi=10.1186%2fs12894-020-00649-8&partnerID=40&md5=d918e70d9caad1c872f0326d51dff87b,"A.C.

,No,"Objectives: Urinary incontinence (UI) is a very common condition in the primary healthcare settings. Few studies have investigated whether sociodemographic factors are related to UI. This nationwide study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between sociodemographic factors and UI in women. Methods: A nationwide open cohort study included 2,044,065 women aged 15–50 years. Several national population-based (Sweden) databases including nationwide primary healthcare data were used. The outcome was the time to the first event of any UI diagnosis during the study period (1997–2018). Cox regression models were used to test for associations between individual sociodemographic factors and UI. Results: The study identified 44,250 UI events. These corresponded to 2.16% of the study population and an incidence rate (IR) per 1000 person-years of 1.85 (95% CI 1.84–1.87). In the fully adjusted model, a high age, low education level, and being born outside of Sweden were independently associated with a higher UI risk, while rural living was associated with a lower risk. The income level did not seem to have a large impact. Most notably, women born in the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America/Caribbean had a substantially higher risk of UI with HRs of 2.41 (95% CI 2.33–2.49) and 2.30 (95% CI 2.17–2.43), respectively. Parity was strongly and independently associated with UI. Conclusion: This study presents novel risk factors associated with UI. The findings provide new knowledge concerning the burden of this disease among women, which could be used to provide more equal healthcare for these patients in the future. Previous research allied with these findings suggests using a comprehensive approach targeting health disparities. © 2022 by the authors.

,No,"Background: The four common soil-transmitted helminth species-. Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and the two hookworm species Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus-are endemic in South America, but their distribution, infection prevalence, and regional burden are poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the risk and number of people infected with A lumbricoides, T trichiura, and hookworm across South America. Methods: We did a systematic review of reports on the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection in South America published up to May 14, 2012. We extracted and georeferenced relevant survey data and did a meta-analysis of the data to assess the geographical distribution of the infection risk with Bayesian geostatistical models. We used advanced Bayesian variable selection to identify environmental determinants that govern the distribution of soil-transmitted helminth infections. Findings: We screened 4085 scientific papers and identified 174 articles containing relevant survey prevalence data. We georeferenced 6948 survey locations and entered the data into the open-access Global Neglected Tropical Diseases database. Survey data were sparse for the south of the continent and for the western coast, and we identified no relevant information for Uruguay and little data for smaller countries such as Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, and Ecuador. Population-adjusted prevalence of infection with A lumbricoides was 15·6%, with T trichiura was 12·5%, and with hookworm was 11·9% from 2005 onwards. Risks of contracting soil-transmitted helminth infection have substantially reduced since 2005 (odds ratio 0·47 [95% Bayesian credible interval 0·46-0·47] for A lumbricoides, 0·54 [0·54-0·55] for T trichiura, and 0·58 [0·58-0·59] for hookworm infection). Interpretation: Our findings offer important baseline support for spatial targeting of soil-transmitted helminthiasis control, and suggest that more information about the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection is needed, especially in countries in which we estimate prevalence of infection to be high but for which current data are scarce.

,No,"Background: Data regarding the geographical distribution of cases and risk factors for COVID-19 death in children and adolescents are scarce. We describe the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in paediatric population and their association with social determinants of health in Brazil. Methods: This is a population-based ecological study with a spatial analysis of all cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in Brazil among children and adolescents aged 0–19 years from March 2020 to October 2021. The units of analysis were the 5570 municipalities. Data on COVID-19 cases and deaths, social vulnerability, health inequities, and health system capacity were obtained from publicly available databases. Municipalities were stratified from low to very high COVID-19 incidence and mortality using K-means clustering procedures, and spatial clusters and relative risks were estimated using spatial statistics with Poisson probability models. The relationship between COVID-19 estimates and social determinants of health was explored by using multivariate Beta regression techniques. Findings: A total of 33,991 COVID-19 cases and 2424 deaths among children and adolescents aged 0–19 years were recorded from March 2020 to October 2021. There was a spatial dependence for the crude mortality coefficient per 100,000 population in the paediatric population aged 0–19 years (I Moran 0·10; P < 0·001). Forty municipalities had higher mortality rates, of which 20 were in states from the Northeast region. Seven spatial clusters were identified for COVID-19 mortality, with four clusters in the Northeast region and three in the North region. Municipalities with higher social inequality and vulnerability had higher COVID-19 mortality in the paediatric population. Interpretation: The main clusters of risk for mortality among children and adolescents were identified in municipalities in the North and Northeast regions, which are the regions with the worst socioeconomic indicators and greatest health disparities in the country. Our findings confirmed the higher burden of COVID-19 for Brazilian paediatric population in municipalities with higher social inequality and vulnerability and worse socioeconomic indicators. To reduce the burden of COVID-19 on children, mass immunisation is necessary.

,No,"Atmospheric emissions from oil activities impact human health, socioeconomic status and exacerbate global warming. This study was conducted in the North-eastern Ecuadorian Amazon, a rich biodiverse and cultural area. This study aimed to show the benefits of public institutional data to advance hazard mapping knowledge for comprehensible risk evaluation. A spatial inventory was built from publicly disclosed reports spanning ten years (2003–2012). Emissions were estimated for gas flaring, associated black carbon (BC) and greenhouse gases (i.e., CO2 and CH4). To assess the quality of publicly available data, the calculated emissions were compared with satellite observations and historical energy statistics from the United Nations (UN). Results indicate total gas flared for this period of 7.6 Gm3, corresponding to 782 Mm3 yr−1, and equivalent to a 3.7–4.5 kt yr−1 of BC. These values were in agreement with the UN estimates, suggesting that publicly available data are of acceptable quality. In contrast, the results from energy censuses diverged from satellite observation data, which might be explained by a poor calibration of satellite sensors. Study results enabled emissions mapping at a higher spatial scale than previous studies. Black carbon presented the highest results with 29.4–148.0 kg m−2 yr−1 in the cities of Shushufindi and Joya de Los Sachas. Greenhouse gases were up to twenty-fold higher than previous estimates. Publicly disclosed data estimates were discussed in terms of their potential on evaluations for climate, local health and economic impacts, to raise environmental monitoring and accountability in governmental institutions. © 2019",Spatial inventory of selected atmospheric emissions from oil industry in Ecuadorian Amazon: Insights from comparisons among satellite and institutional datasets,"Durango-Cordero J., Saqalli M., Parra R., Elger A.",2019,Safety Science,120,,,107,116,,7,10.1016/j.ssci.2019.05.047,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068104219&doi=10.1016%2fj.ssci.2019.05.047&partnerID=40&md5=79cac3ca647f2c95fe18abb0dc48ed4b,"Université Paul Sabatier, Laboratory of Functional Ecology and Environment, 31062 Toulouse, ECOLAB, France; Université Toulouse Jean Jaurès, Laboratory of Environmental Geography, 31058 Toulouse, GEODE, France; Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Instituto de Simulación Computacional, Quito, 170902, Ecuador; Andean University Simon Bolivar, Toledo N2280, Quito, Ecuador","Durango-Cordero, J., Université Paul Sabatier, Laboratory of Functional Ecology and Environment, 31062 Toulouse, ECOLAB, France, Université Toulouse Jean Jaurès, Laboratory of Environmental Geography, 31058 Toulouse, GEODE, France, Andean University Simon Bolivar, Toledo N2280, Quito, Ecuador; Saqalli, M., Université Toulouse Jean Jaurès, Laboratory of Environmental Geography, 31058 Toulouse, GEODE, France; Parra, R., Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Instituto de Simulación Computacional, Quito, 170902, Ecuador; Elger, A., Université Paul Sabatier, Laboratory of Functional Ecology and Environment, 31062 Toulouse, ECOLAB, France",Black carbon; Greenhouse emissions; Public disclosure; Spatial inventory; The Amazon,Atmospheric spectra; Carbon; Flare stacks; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Mapping; Satellites; Black carbon; Greenhouse emissions; Public disclosures; Spatial inventory; The Amazon; Air pollution; black carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; air pollution; Article; controlled study; Ecuador; gas flaring; greenhouse gas; oil industry; priority journal; risk assessment; telecommunication,Black carbon;Greenhouse emissions;Public disclosure;Spatial inventory;The Amazon;Atmospheric spectra;Carbon;Flare stacks;Gas emissions;Global warming;Greenhouse gases;Mapping;Satellites;Public disclosures;Air pollution;carbon dioxide;methane;Article;controlled study;Ecuador;gas flaring;greenhouse gas;oil industry;priority journal;risk assessment;telecommunication,"Durango-Cordero, J.Avenue de l'Agrobiopole – BP 32607, France; email: juandurango2012@gmail.com",,,,,,Elsevier B.V.,9257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

,No,"Cities are complex, networked and continuously changing social ecosystems, shaped and transformed through the interaction of different interests and ambitions. Employment, sustainable development, inclusion, security and quality of life are important concerns and in this respect many cities are confronted with a wide range of challenges. Cities, particularly in rural areas, are also facing the implications of ageing population in combination with economic decline [9]. However cities also represent a promise for the future: a vision of freedom, creativity, opportunity and prosperity [4]. More than half of the global population is now urban and projections estimate that this percentage will even grow towards 70 % in 2050 [13]. At the same time, technology is currently promoting unprecedented changes in urban areas, which are often labelled as smart city developments. Internet-based infrastructures of cities, addressing the above mentioned concerns, comprise a diversity of services in areas such as healthcare, energy, education, environmental management, transportation and mobility, and public safety. These services are increasingly enabled by broadband infrastructures, wireless sensor networks, Internet-based networked applications, open data and open platforms. Over the past decade digital technologies have begun to blanket our cities, working together to form the backbone of a large, intelligent infrastructure. Broadband fibre-optic and wireless telecommunications grids are supporting mobile phones, smart phones and tablets that are increasingly affordable. At the same time, open databases - especially about government - that people can read and add to are revealing all sorts of information, and public kiosks and displays in buildings are allowing literate and illiterate people to access information. Add to this foundation a relentlessly growing network of sensors and digital control technologies such as smart meters, all tied together by cheap, powerful computers and our cities are quickly becoming like computers in open air. Against this background, this Special Issue addresses the role of smart applications in cities, especially inasmuch they foster enhanced living and working conditions, new modes of participation and a higher level of engagement of citizens.

,No,"To assess the cost-effectiveness of the robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) compared to open radical prostatectomy (ORP) for localized prostate cancer from a healthcare perspective in Colombia. A systematic review was conducted in Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases, to identify relevant publications up to January 2020 to summarize clinical outcomes related to effectiveness of robot-assisted and open radical prostatectomy. A tree decision model was designed given the clinical outcomes and possibilities of complication and success. Outcomes were defined as complications according to Clavien – Dindo classification and success measured as urethral stricture rate. Cost was divided into two categories: surgical procedure and complications. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated and a deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of the uncertainty on the conclusions of the model. A 90-day horizon was defined. Direct medical costs associated with RALRP were $6.511 ($ 5.127– $8.138), and for ORP were $4.476 ($2.170–$ 6.511). The average cost for complication management was rated at $ 327 for RALRP and $ 382 for ORP, based on an augmented risk of post-operative urethral stricture in the ORP group (2.4% vs 10.8%). ICER was calculated in USD $18.987. The cost of RALRP has to be reduced to around USD 5.345 to achieve an ICER under 1 GDP making the intervention feasible. Using a 3 GDP per capita threshold, the implementation of RALRP could be cost-effective for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in emerging economies. Bolder measures including the use of one needle carrier, three robotic arms, and a shorten hospitalization program of 24 h, can save around $1000 for each patient, achieving the goal cost of $5345 needed for a favorable ICER. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Strategies to improve cost effectiveness of robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in emerging economies,"Caicedo J.I., Santander J., Taborda A., Medina C., Zuluaga L., Trujillo C.G., Castillo C.B., Londono Trujillo D., Plata M.",2023,Journal of Robotic Surgery,17,1,,243,250,,0,10.1007/s11701-022-01431-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131402759&doi=10.1007%2fs11701-022-01431-8&partnerID=40&md5=2f757a7575b00faf3ed7f7b964305799,"Department of Urology, Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá and Universidad de los Andes School of Medicine, Carrera 7 No. 118-09, Unidad Renal, piso 3, D.C, Bogotá, 110111, Colombia; Department of Public Health and Health Economics, Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá, D.C, Bogotá, Colombia","Caicedo, J.I., Department of Urology, Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá and Universidad de los Andes School of Medicine, Carrera 7 No. 118-09, Unidad Renal, piso 3, D.C, Bogotá, 110111, Colombia; Santander, J., Department of Urology, Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá and Universidad de los Andes School of Medicine, Carrera 7 No. 118-09, Unidad Renal, piso 3, D.C, Bogotá, 110111, Colombia; Taborda, A., Department of Public Health and Health Economics, Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá, D.C, Bogotá, Colombia; Medina, C., Department of Urology, Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá and Universidad de los Andes School of Medicine, Carrera 7 No. 118-09, Unidad Renal, piso 3, D.C, Bogotá, 110111, Colombia; Zuluaga, L., Department of Urology, Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá and Universidad de los Andes School of Medicine, Carrera 7 No. 118-09, Unidad Renal, piso 3, D.C, Bogotá, 110111, Colombia; Trujillo, C.G., Department of Urology, Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá and Universidad de los Andes School of Medicine, Carrera 7 No. 118-09, Unidad Renal, piso 3, D.C, Bogotá, 110111, Colombia; Castillo, C.B., Department of Urology, Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá and Universidad de los Andes School of Medicine, Carrera 7 No. 118-09, Unidad Renal, piso 3, D.C, Bogotá, 110111, Colombia; Londoño Trujillo, D., Department of Public Health and Health Economics, Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá, D.C, Bogotá, Colombia; Plata, M., Department of Urology, Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá and Universidad de los Andes School of Medicine, Carrera 7 No. 118-09, Unidad Renal, piso 3, D.C, Bogotá, 110111, Colombia",Cost-effectiveness; Prostate cancer; Radical prostatectomy laparoscopic assisted,Cost benefit analysis; Diseases; Laparoscopy; Robotics; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Urology; Clinical outcome; Colombia; Cost-effectiveness ratios; Emerging economies; Incremental cost; Localized prostate cancer; Prostate cancers; Radical prostatectomy; Radical prostatectomy laparoscopic assisted; Urethral stricture; Cost effectiveness; Article; cost effectiveness analysis; decision tree; economic aspect; health care cost; hospitalization; human; prostate cancer; robot assisted surgery; robot-assisted prostatectomy; sensitivity analysis; surgical technique; systematic review; urethra stenosis; laparoscopy; male; procedures; prostate tumor; prostatectomy; treatment outcome; urethra stenosis; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Treatment Outcome; Urethral Stricture,Cost-effectiveness;Prostate cancer;Radical prostatectomy laparoscopic assisted;Cost benefit analysis;Diseases;Laparoscopy;Robotics;Sensitivity analysis;Uncertainty analysis;Urology;Clinical outcome;Colombia;Cost-effectiveness ratios;Emerging economies;Incremental cost;Localized prostate cancer;Prostate cancers;Radical prostatectomy;Urethral stricture;Cost effectiveness;Article;cost effectiveness analysis;decision tree;economic aspect;health care cost;hospitalization;human;robot assisted surgery;robot-assisted prostatectomy;surgical technique;systematic review;urethra stenosis;male;procedures;prostate tumor;prostatectomy;treatment outcome;Cost-Effectiveness Analysis;Humans;Prostatic Neoplasms;Robotic Surgical Procedures,"Caicedo, J.I.; Department of Urology, Carrera 7 No. 118-09, Unidad Renal, piso 3, D.C, Colombia; email: juan.caicedo@fsfb.org.co",,,,,,Springer Nature,18632483,,,35668314,English,J.

,No,"Suicide, suicide ideations, and psychiatric disorder rates tend to increase after natural disasters such as earth-quake. In 2016 Ecuador experienced a 7.8Mw earthquake and, more recently, the Covid-19 confinement. Both events may have negatively affected the mental health of the Ecuadorian population. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the suicide rates and choice of suicide method in the Ecuadorian population between January 2011 and December 2020. The dataset used is publicly available on the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Censuses. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) for potential sociodemographic factors associated with each suicide method compared to other reported suicide methods. There were 10,380 registered cases of suicide in Ecuador between 2011 and 2020. Significant suicide rates per provinces were seen in Napo with 12.63 and Azuay with 12.52, followed by Bolivar with 12.30, and Orellana with 11.36 suicides/100,000 habitants. Hanging accounted for 7082 cases (68.2 %). The mestizos (82 %) were the most prevalent ethnicity of all suicide cases. School-age children with 6-12 years (OR 8.83, 95 % CI 5.34-14.59) and adolescents with 13-19 years (OR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.29-1.66) were more likely to use hanging as method of suicide. In conclusion, we observed an increase of suicide rates from 8.15 per 100,000 in 2011 to 8.81 in 2020. The confinement of COVID-19 pandemic in the period evaluated did not significantly affect the suicide rates. An increased suicide rate was observed in the province hardest hit by the 2016 earthquake.",Suicide rates in Ecuador: A nationwide study from 2011 until 2020,"Lapo-Talledo, G.J., Talledo-Delgado, J.A., Portalanza, D., Rodrigues, A.L.S., Siteneski, A.",2023,JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,320,,,638,646,9,0,10.1016/j.jad.2022.09.167,,"[Lapo-Talledo, German Josuet; Talledo-Delgado, Jorge Andres; Siteneski, Aline] Univ Tecn Manabi, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Med, Portoviejo, Manabi, Ecuador; [Portalanza, Diego] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Phys, Climate Res Grp, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Ana Lucia S.] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Biol Sci, Dept Biochem, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Siteneski, Aline] Univ Tecn Manabi, Res Inst, Portoviejo, Manabi, Ecuador; [Siteneski, Aline] Univ Tecn Manabi, Res Inst, Portoviejo 130105, Ecuador; [Siteneski, Aline] Univ Tecn Manabi, Fac Hlth Sci, Portoviejo 130105, Ecuador",,Suicide; Ecuador; COVID-19; Earthquake; Hanging,RISK-FACTORS; MORTALITY; HOPELESSNESS; DEATH,Suicide;Ecuador;COVID-19;Earthquake;Hanging;RISK-FACTORS;MORTALITY;HOPELESSNESS;DEATH,aline.siteneski@gmail.com,,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,ELSEVIER,0165-0327,,,36208687,English,J AFFECT DISORDERS,Article,WoS,Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,WOS:000888135400016,2-s2.0-85139847969,Ecuador;Brazil,gmail.com,Univ Tecn Manabi;Univ Fed Santa Maria;Univ Fed Santa Catarina,"Univ Tecn Manabi, Ecuador;Univ Fed Santa Maria, Brazil;Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Brazil","Lapo-Talledo, German Josuet; Talledo-Delgado, Jorge Andres; Portalanza, Diego; Rodrigues, Ana Lucia S.; Siteneski, Aline",,
,No,"Background Environmental degradation facilitates the emergence of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, through changes in the ecological landscape that increase human-vector contacts and that expand vector habitats. However, the modifying effects of environmental degradation on climate-disease relationships have not been well explored. Here, we investigate the rapid re-emergence of malaria in a transmission hotspot in southern Venezuela and explore the synergistic effects of environmental degradation, specifically gold-mining activity, and climate variation. Methods In this spatiotemporal modelling study of the 46 parishes of the state of Bolivar, southeast Venezuela, we used data from the Venezuelan Ministry of Health including population data and monthly cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and Plasmodium vivax malaria between 1996 and 2016. We estimated mean precipitation and temperature using the ERA5-Land dataset and used monthly anomalies in sea-surface temperature as an indicator of El Nino events between 1996 and 2016. The location of suspected mining sites in Bolivar in 2009, 2017, and 2018 were sourced from the Amazon Geo-Referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network. We estimated measures of cumulative forest loss and urban development by km2 using annual land cover maps from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative between 1996 and 2016. We modelled monthly cases of P falciparum and P vivax malaria using a Bayesian hierarchical mixed model framework. We quantified the variation explained by mining activity before exploring the modifying effects of environmental degradation on climate-malaria relationships. Findings We observed a 27% reduction in the additional unexplained spatial variation in incidence of P falciparum malaria and a 23% reduction in P vivax malaria when mining was included in our models. The effect of temperature on malaria was greater in high mining areas than low mining areas, and the P falciparum malaria effect size at temperatures of 26middot5 degrees C (2middot4 cases per 1000 people [95% CI 1middot78-3middot06]) was twice as high as the effect in low mining areas (1 case per 1000 people [0middot68-1middot49]). Interpretation We show that mining activity in southern Venezuela is associated with hotspots of malaria transmission. Increased temperatures exacerbated malaria transmission in mining areas, highlighting the need to consider how environmental degradation modulates climate effect on disease risk, which is especially important in areas subjected to rapidly rising temperatures and land-use change globally. Our findings have implications for the progress towards malaria elimination in the Latin American region. Our findings are also important for effectively targeting timely treatment programmes and vector-control activities in mining areas with high rates of malaria transmission. Copyright (C) 2022.

,No,"Objective: To show the results of a literature review about the investigation and methodology of Systematization of Experiences and its relevance in public health. Method: A literature review was carried out in two stages. The following Boolean operators were used: “systematization of experiences” AND “methodology” OR “research” OR “health” OR “popular education” OR “social work” OR “Latin America” OR “Participatory Action Research”, in the MedLine and Scielo databases, was complemented by a search in the general catalog of the libraries of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana and the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Date and language were left open. N-Vivo version 12 was used for the processing and description of the information. Results: A total of 183 references were obtained from articles, books, gray literature, thesis (undergraduate, master’s or doctorate) and audiovisual material. Of these, 88 were selected for full text review. Six categories were created related to the definition, methodology, instruments, objectives, limits-tensions and advantages of the Systematization of experiences. Conclusions: The Systematization of Experiences is a methodological strategy that contributes to qualitative research created within the context of Latin America, which allows us to recover the history and knowledge of practices while also strengthening and transforming the local reality. In the field of public health, it allows us to reinterpreting the notions and problems of individuals and communities; understanding their experiences, needs and expectations in health; and identify people’s agency to improve and positively influence the well-being and quality of life of the community. © 2022, Universidad del Norte.

,No,"Introduction At the 72nd World Health Assembly of May 2019, WHO member states prioritised a global action plan to promote migrant and refugee health. Five months earlier, WHO had declared vaccine hesitancy-the reluctance to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccination services-as one of the top 10 threats to global health. Although vaccination is often a requirement for immigration, repeated outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases within certain immigrant communities in some host nations suggest that vaccine hesitancy could be a factor in their susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases. Studies of the prevalence and determinants of vaccine hesitancy among migrants globally seem to be lacking. This scoping review will (1) identify articles on vaccine hesitancy among migrants; (2) examine the extent and nature of the extant evidence; and (3) determine the value of undertaking a full systematic review. Methods and analysis The framework for the scoping review proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute will be used. The reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. Studies published in English or French between January 1999 and December 2019 will be drawn from most or all of the following multidisciplinary databases: Africa-Wide Information, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Index Medicus for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, International Bibliography of Social Sciences, Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean, Medline, Proquest Theses/Dissertations, PsycInfo and Web of Science. The search will include an extensive list of keywords to capture multiple dimensions of confidence and hesitancy vis-à-vis vaccines among migrants. Findings will be reported through summary narratives, tables, flowcharts and evidence maps.

,No,"The aim of this study was to assess temporal trends in disability benefits for breast cancer awarded to women by Brazil’s National Social Security Institute. We conducted a time-series analysis of disability benefit incidence rates between 2007 and 2018 using joinpoint regression and data from the Unified Benefits Infor-mation System (SUIBE) and open access social security system database. The age-adjusted incidence rate increased by 6.7% per year between 2015 and 2018 after a period of stability between 2007 and 2014. The number of benefits granted to women aged 20-49 increased, on average, by 3.4% per year, showing a marked rise from 2015 to 2018 (10.4% per year). The findings highlight that breast cancer is an important cause of sick leave among female workers and that the incidence of the disease is growing in younger economically active women, reinforcing the importance of early referral to the Social Security Professional Reha-bilitation Program to help workers return to work and readapt to working life. © 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

This study analyzed all vena cava filter procedures conducted from 2008 to 2018 in the city of São Paulo and registered on the public database using a big data system to conduct web scraping of publicly available databases,Yes,"Background: Vena cava filter implantation is considered a simple procedure, which can lead to overuse and over-indication. It is nevertheless associated with short and long-term complications. Objectives: The goals of this study were to evaluate rates of vena cava filter implantation conducted by Brazil’s Unified Public Health System, analyzing in-hospital mortality and migration of patients from other cities seeking medical attention in São Paulo. Methods: This study analyzed all vena cava filter procedures conducted from 2008 to 2018 in the city of São Paulo and registered on the public database using a big data system to conduct web scraping of publicly available databases. Results: A total of 1324 vena cava filter implantations were analyzed. 60.5% of the patients were female; 61.7% were under 65 years old; 34.07% had registered addresses in other cities or states; and there was a 7.4% in-hospital mortality rate. Conclusions: We observed an increase in the rates of use of vena cava filters up to 2010 and a decrease in rates from that year onwards, which coincides with the year that the Food and Drug Administration published a recommendation to better evaluate vena cava filter indications. © 2022 The authors.",Temporal trends in vena cava filter implantation in public health system inpatients: an 11-year analysis of the largest city in Brazil [Tendência temporal do implante de filtro de veia cava em pacientes internados no SUS em São Paulo: análise de 11 anos da maior cidade do Brasil],"Leiderman D.B.D., Fiorelli M., Teivelis M.P., Stabellini N., Amaro Junior E., Wolosker N.",2022,Jornal Vascular Brasileiro,21,,e20210186,,,,0,10.1590/1677-5449.20210186,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129513573&doi=10.1590%2f1677-5449.20210186&partnerID=40&md5=479295f1d2b730a5cd634beeb070c448,"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein – HIAE, SP, São Paulo, Brazil; Universidade de São Paulo – USP, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital de Clínicas, SP, São Paulo, Brazil; Faculdade Israelita de Ciências, Médicas Albert Einstein – FICMAE, SP, São Paulo, Brazil; Universidade de São Paulo – USP, SP, São Paulo, Brazil","Leiderman, D.B.D., Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein – HIAE, SP, São Paulo, Brazil, Universidade de São Paulo – USP, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital de Clínicas, SP, São Paulo, Brazil; Fiorelli, M., Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein – HIAE, SP, São Paulo, Brazil, Universidade de São Paulo – USP, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital de Clínicas, SP, São Paulo, Brazil; Teivelis, M.P., Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein – HIAE, SP, São Paulo, Brazil, Universidade de São Paulo – USP, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital de Clínicas, SP, São Paulo, Brazil; Stabellini, N., Faculdade Israelita de Ciências, Médicas Albert Einstein – FICMAE, SP, São Paulo, Brazil; Amaro Júnior, E., Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein – HIAE, SP, São Paulo, Brazil, Universidade de São Paulo – USP, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital de Clínicas, SP, São Paulo, Brazil, Universidade de São Paulo – USP, SP, São Paulo, Brazil; Wolosker, N., Universidade de São Paulo – USP, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital de Clínicas, SP, São Paulo, Brazil, Universidade de São Paulo – USP, SP, São Paulo, Brazil",epidemiology; inferior vena cava filter; mortality rate; public health system; pulmonary embolism; thrombosis,aged; aging; Article; big data; demographics; female; help seeking behavior; human; in-hospital mortality; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; public health service; Sao Paulo (state); sex ratio,epidemiology;inferior vena cava filter;mortality rate;public health system;pulmonary embolism;thrombosis;aged;aging;Article;big data;demographics;female;help seeking behavior;human;in-hospital mortality;major clinical study;male;public health service;Sao Paulo (state);sex ratio,"Leiderman, D.B.D.; Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein – HIAE, Av.

,No,"Public health institutions with sectorized structure and low integration among field teams, old-fashioned practices such as paper-based storage system, and poorly qualified health agents have limited ability to conduct accurate surveillance and design effective timely interventions. Herein, we describe the steps taken by the Zoonosis Control Center of Foz do Iguacu (CCZ-Foz) in the last 23 years to move from an archaic and sectorized structure to a modern and timely surveillance program embracing zoonotic diseases, venomous animal injuries, and vector-borne diseases epidemiology under the One Health approach. The full implementation of the One Health approach was based on 5 axes: (1) merging sectorized field teams; (2) adoption of digital solutions; (3) health agents empowerment and permanent capacitation; (4) social mobilization; and (5) active surveys. By doing so, notifications related to zoonotic diseases and venomous animals increased 10 and 21 times, respectively, with no impairment on arbovirus surveillance (major concern in the city). Open sources database (PostgreSQL) and software (QGis) are daily updated and create real-time maps to support timely decisions. The adoption of One Health approach increased preparedness for endemic diseases and reemerging and emerging threats such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","The adoption of the One Health approach to improve surveillance of venomous animal injury, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases in Foz do Iguacu, Brazil","Leandro, A.D., Lopes, R.D., Martins, C.A., Rivas, A.V., da Silva, I., Galvao, S.R., Maciel-de-Freitas, R.",2021,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,15,2,e0009109,,,8,11,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009109,,"[Leandro, Andre de Souza; Lopes, Renata Defante; Martins, Caroline Amaral; da Silva, Isaac; Galvao, Sandro Roberto] Secretaria Municipal Saude Foz do Iguacu, Ctr Controle Zoonoses, Foz Do Iguacu, Parana, Brazil; [Leandro, Andre de Souza; Maciel-de-Freitas, Rafael] Fiocruz MS, Lab Transmissores Hematozoarios, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Rivas, Acucena Veleh] Ctr Med Trop Triplice Fronteira, Lab Saude Unica, Foz Do Iguacu, Parana, Brazil; [Maciel-de-Freitas, Rafael] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Nacl Ciencia & Tecnol Entomol Mol, Inst Bioquim Med, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,,AEDES-AEGYPTI DIPTERA; DENGUE,AEDES-AEGYPTI DIPTERA;DENGUE,freitas@ioc.fiocruz.br,,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",,,,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,1935-2735,,,33600424,English,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Article,WoS,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,WOS:000620634200005,2-s2.0-85101734630,Brazil,ioc.fiocruz.br,Secretaria Municipal Saude Foz do Iguacu;Fiocruz MS;Ctr Med Trop Triplice Fronteira;Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro,"Secretaria Municipal Saude Foz do Iguacu, Brazil;Fiocruz MS, Brazil;Ctr Med Trop Triplice Fronteira, Brazil;Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Leandro, Andre de Souza; Lopes, Renata Defante; Martins, Caroline Amaral; Rivas, Acucena Veleh; da Silva, Isaac; Galvao, Sandro Roberto; Maciel-de-Freitas, Rafael",,
,No,"This study examines the relationship of neighborhood recreational space with youth smoking in mid- to low-income areas in the capital of Chile, Santiago. A unique data set of adolescents (n = 779, mean age = 14, 51 % male) provided home addresses of study participants which were geocoded and mapped. Satellite maps of neighborhoods were used to identify open spaces for recreational use (e.g., soccer fields and plazas). Thiessen polygons were generated to associate study participants with the nearest available open space using ArcGIS. Regression models, with smoking as a dependent variable, were estimated in which age, sex, family socioeconomic status, peer substance usage, neighborhood crime, and accessibility of open space were covariates. The results show that residential proximity to recreational space was significantly and inversely associated with tobacco consumption among female, but not male, adolescents. Age and neighborhood crime were both positively associated with tobacco consumption among both male and female adolescents. This study suggests that recreational spaces in proximity to residences may have a positive impact on reducing adolescents' inclination to consume tobacco. The relationship of the accessibility to such spaces with smoking appears to vary by adolescents' sex.","The association of recreational space with youth smoking in low-socioeconomic status neighborhoods in Santiago, Chile","Lee, W., Grogan-Kaylor, A., Sanhueza, G., Andrade, F., Delva, J.",2014,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,59,1,,87,94,8,8,10.1007/s00038-013-0477-y,,"[Lee, Wonhyung; Grogan-Kaylor, Andrew; Andrade, Fernando; Delva, Jorge] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sanhueza, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,Environmental health; Residence characteristics; Smoking; Adolescent behavior; GIS,CIGARETTE-SMOKING; AREA CHARACTERISTICS; UNITED-STATES; YOUNG-ADULTS; HEALTH; PEERS; ADOLESCENCE; CHILDHOOD; MORTALITY; STUDENTS,Environmental health;Residence characteristics;Smoking;Adolescent behavior;GIS;CIGARETTE-SMOKING;AREA CHARACTERISTICS;UNITED-STATES;YOUNG-ADULTS;HEALTH;PEERS;ADOLESCENCE;CHILDHOOD;MORTALITY;STUDENTS,elsalee@umich.edu,,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",,,,SPRINGER BASEL AG,1661-8556,,,23722521,English,INT J PUBLIC HEALTH,Article,WoS,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",WOS:000331962900010,2-s2.0-84897771069,United States;Chile,umich.edu,Univ Michigan;Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile,"Univ Michigan, United States;Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Chile","Lee, Wonhyung; Grogan-Kaylor, Andrew; Sanhueza, Guillermo; Andrade, Fernando; Delva, Jorge",,
,No,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 was introduced in North America in late 2021 through trans-Atlantic pathways via migratory birds. These introductions have resulted in an unprecedented epizootic, a widespread disease event in animals, heavily affecting poultry, wild birds, and recently mammals. The North American incursions occurred during the largest epidemic season (2021-2022) in Europe where H5N1 may now be endemic (i.e., continuously present). The continuing outbreak includes expansion into Mexico, Central and South America beginning in late 2022. Here, we provide an overview of the Eurasian origin H5N1 introduction to the Americas, including a significant shift in virus dynamics and severe disease in wild birds. Then, to investigate the global changes in confirmed detections in wild birds and poultry across time and geographic regions, we analyzed FAO's EMPRES-i + database. To examine the 2021 introduction and spread in North American wild birds and poultry, we collated publicly available data across USA and Canadian federal sources. Based on our assessment, the unique magnitude of the North American H5N1 spread indicates the need for effective decision framing to prioritize management needs and scientific inquiry, particularly for species at risk and interface areas for wildlife, poultry, and humans. We illustrate the rapidly occurring and likely increasing detrimental effects that this One Health issue has on wildlife, agriculture, and potentially human health, and we offer a reframing of HPAIV disease response towards a decision analytical context to guide scientific prioritization as a potentially valuable change in focus.",The changing dynamics of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1: Next steps for management & science in North America,"Harvey, J.A., Mullinax, J.M., Runge, M.C., Prosser, D.J.",2023,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,282,,110041,,,11,0,10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110041,,"[Harvey, Johanna A.; Mullinax, Jennifer M.] Univ Maryland, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Harvey, Johanna A.; Runge, Michael C.; Prosser, Diann J.] US Geol Survey, Eastern Ecol Sci Ctr, Laurel, MD 20708 USA",,Avian influenza; Disease management; Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus; Poultry; Clade 2; 3; 4; 4b; Structured decision making; Wild birds,EXPERT ELICITATION; VIRUSES; MORTALITY; EVOLUTION; INFECTION; GENE,Avian influenza;Disease management;Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus;Poultry;Clade 2;3;4;4b;Structured decision making;Wild birds;EXPERT ELICITATION;VIRUSES;MORTALITY;EVOLUTION;INFECTION;GENE,dprosser@usgs.gov,,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,0006-3207,,,,English,BIOL CONSERV,Article,WoS,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000990362700001,2-s2.0-85153797505,United States,usgs.gov,Univ Maryland;US Geol Survey,"Univ Maryland, United States;US Geol Survey, United States","Harvey, Johanna A.; Mullinax, Jennifer M.; Runge, Michael C.; Prosser, Diann J.",,
,No,"Introduction: Inguinal hernia pathology is frequent, but its approaches may vary. Spain and Spanish-speaking Latin America share an official language and databases, but the similarities in treatment are unknown, the standards of the International Guide for the Management of Inguinal Hernia are not followed. The objective of this study was to know and analyse the real management of inguinal hernia patients in these countries and compare it with the recommendations. Method: A survey with 48 questions was conducted between Latin American and Spanish general surgeons. Hernia and Surgery Associations and social networks were used for its diffusion. Google Forms and SPSS version 26.0 were used to collect and analyse the information, with frequencies and percentages for qualitative variables, measures of central tendency for quantitative variables, χ2-distribution and Student’s t for associations. Results: 366 surveys were obtained from a majority of countries. The surveyed were surgeons with more than 11 years of experience, that performed mainly abdominal wall surgery, and 23 % specialised in abdominal wall. 58 % operated less than 3 hernias per week. Contrary to the recommendations, spinal anaesthesia was widely used (56 %). The preferred open approach was the Lichtenstein (80 %). 23 % did not perform minimally invasive surgery for inguinal hernia, although 58 % considered it as the future. 78 % of the Spanish surgeons denied this statement. The use of the mesh plug (37 %) and prophylactic neurectomy (45 %) were discouraged, but the pubic fixation point was still used (44 %). For the 53 % the International Guide was unknown, 52 % considered themselves as an expert, and performed more laparoscopic repair per week (79 %). Conclusions: The management of patients with inguinal hernia has many similarities and even though the Guide is not well-known, most of its recommendations are followed with exceptions. The laparoscopic repair was less accepted in Spain. The guidelines should be disseminated more widely for a better patient care. © 2022 Sociedad Hispanoamericana de Hernia.",The current management of patients with inguinal hernia in Spain and Latin America compared to the International Guide for the Management of Inguinal Hernia [El estado actual del manejo del paciente con hernia inguinal en España e Hispanoamérica comparado con la Guía internacional para el manejo de la hernia inguinal],"Martinez-Hoed J., Garcia-Pastor P., Ortiz-Cubero J.A., Pous-Serrano S.",2022,Revista Hispanoamericana de Hernia,10,2,,70,81,,0,10.20960/rhh.00475,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131227001&doi=10.20960%2frhh.00475&partnerID=40&md5=8d6305cd78e5c1d86269ccbde8c08c6c,"Unidad de Cirugía de Corta Estancia y Pared, Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain; Servicio de Cirugía General., Grupo de Innovación Tecnológica (GIT) de Hernia Compleja., Hospital Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, San José, Costa Rica","Martínez-Hoed, J., Unidad de Cirugía de Corta Estancia y Pared, Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain; García-Pastor, P., Servicio de Cirugía General., Grupo de Innovación Tecnológica (GIT) de Hernia Compleja., Hospital Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, San José, Costa Rica; Ortiz-Cubero, J.Á., Servicio de Cirugía General., Grupo de Innovación Tecnológica (GIT) de Hernia Compleja., Hospital Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, San José, Costa Rica; Pous-Serrano, S., Unidad de Cirugía de Corta Estancia y Pared, Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain",guideline; hernioplasty; Inguinal hernia; laparoscopy,local anesthetic agent; Article; controlled study; health care survey; hernioplasty; human; inguinal hernia; laparoscopic surgery; minimally invasive surgery; neurectomy; normal human; open surgery; practice guideline; prophylactic surgical procedure; South and Central America; Spain; spinal anesthesia; surgeon; work experience,guideline;hernioplasty;Inguinal hernia;laparoscopy;local anesthetic agent;Article;controlled study;health care survey;human;laparoscopic surgery;minimally invasive surgery;neurectomy;normal human;open surgery;practice guideline;prophylactic surgical procedure;South and Central America;Spain;spinal anesthesia;surgeon;work experience,"Martínez-Hoed, J.; Unidad de Cirugía de Corta Estancia y Pared, Av. de Fernando Abril Martorell, 106., Spain; email: dr.martinezhoed@gmail.com",,,,,,ARAN Ediciones S.L,22552677,,,,Spanish,Rev.

The relevant public health risks of C. jejuni are caused by particular virulence genes encompassing its virulome. We analyzed 40,371 publicly available genomes of C. jejuni deposited in the NCBI Pathogen Detection Database, combining their epidemi-ologic metadata with an in silico bioinformatics analysis to increase our current comprehension of their virulome from a global perspective. The collection presented a virulome composed of 126 identified virulence factors that were grouped in three clusters representing the accessory, the softcore, and the essential core genes according to their prevalence within the genomes. The multi-locus sequence type distribution in the genomes was also investigated. An unexpected low prevalence of the full-length flagellin flaA and flaB locus of C. jejuni genomes was revealed, and an essential core virulence gene repertoire prevalent in more than 99.99% of genomes was identified. Alto-gether, this is a pioneer study regarding Campylobacter jejuni that has compiled a significant amount of data about the Multilocus Sequence Type and virulence factors concerning their global prevalence and distribution over this database. © 2021 by the authors.

A descriptive analysis of costs included a calculation of the overall and mean maximum price to consumers. Monetary costs were converted from local currency units (Brazilian Real - BRL) to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchanging rates. Results129,708 prescriptions were retrieved from the database. The overall expenditure on opioids was R$4,316,383.46 BRL or $2,721,315.82 (PPP). The mean cost of an individual prescription was R$33.27 BRL ($20.98 PPP), ranging from 14.19 to 3,255.60 BRL. Codeine was frequently prescribed (87.2 percent).

,No,"Background: Intra-uterine growth is a powerful predictor of infant mortality and of health, developmental and socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood. The question about whether this relationship is causal rather than driven by unobserved characteristics of low-weight infants is, however, still open. We use twin models to examine the hypothesis that in utero growth has a detrimental impact on cognitive development in childhood. Methods: We merge birth registry information on birthweight with standardized Math and Spanish test scores for all fourth graders in Chile to create a prospective data set. Twin fixed-effects models are used to estimate the causal effect of intra-uterine growth on test scores. Fixed-effect estimates are compared with traditional regression results in a cross-section of births to gauge the omitted variable bias emerging from unobserved genetic, maternal and pregnancy-related factors in cross-sectional models. Results: Birthweight differences within twin pairs have a substantial effect on test scores. A 400-g increase in birthweight results in a 15% standard deviation increase in Math scores. The effect is larger among (estimated) monozygotic than dizygotic pairs, reaching >20% standard deviation. The effect varies across family socioeconomic status. It is strong among disadvantaged families but it nearly disappears among advantaged ones. Conclusion: Scarcity of uterine resources resulting in intra-uterine growth restriction has a detrimental effect on cognitive development in childhood. This effect interacts with family socioeconomic status (SES), so that low-SES families reinforce the effect of low birthweight and high-SES families fully compensate for it. Findings are particularly relevant in the developing world, where intra-uterine growth restriction is the main determinant of low birthweight.

,No,"Background Dengue fever is the most common arboviral disease in humans, with an estimated 50-100 million annual infections worldwide. Dengue fever cases have increased substantially in the past four decades, driven largely by anthropogenic factors including climate change. More than half the population of Peru is at risk of dengue infection and due to its geography, Peru is also particularly sensitive to the effects of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Determining the effect of ENSO on the risk for dengue outbreaks is of particular public health relevance and may also be applicable to other Aedes-vectored viruses. Methods We conducted a time-series analysis at the level of the district-month, using surveillance data collected from January 2000 to September 2018 from all districts with a mean elevation suitable to survival of the mosquito vector (<2,500m), and ENSO and weather data from publicly-available datasets maintained by national and international agencies. We took a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to address correlation in space, and B-splines with four knots per year to address correlation in time. We furthermore conducted subgroup analyses by season and natural region. Results We detected a positive and significant effect of temperature (˚C, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.13, 1.15, adjusted for precipitation) and ENSO (ICEN index: RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.15, 1.20; ONI index: RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02, 1.07) on outbreak risk, but no evidence of a strong effect for precipitation after adjustment for temperature. Both natural region and season were found to be significant effect modifiers of the ENSO-dengue effect, with the effect of ENSO being stronger in the summer and the Selva Alta and Costa regions, compared with winter and Selva Baja and Sierra regions. Conclusions Our results provide strong evidence that temperature and ENSO have significant effects on dengue outbreaks in Peru, however these results interact with region and season, and are stronger for local ENSO impacts than remote ENSO impacts. These findings support optimization of a dengue early warning system based on local weather and climate moni-toring, including where and when to deploy such a system and parameterization of ENSO events, and provide high-precision effect estimates for future climate and dengue modeling efforts. © 2022 Dostal et al.","The effect of weather and climate on dengue outbreak risk in Peru, 2000-2018: A time-series analysis","Dostal T., Meisner J., Munaycoid C., Garcia P.J., Carcamo C., Lu J.E.P., Morin C., Frisbie L., Rabinowitz P.M.",2022,PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,16,6,e0010479,,,,3,10.1371/JOURNAL.PNTD.0010479,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134387351&doi=10.1371%2fJOURNAL.PNTD.0010479&partnerID=40&md5=90827041a01c54d23a1fef8246ab6a97,"Center for One Health Research, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States; Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States; Centro Nacional de Epidemiología, Prevención y Control de Enfermedades, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru; School of Public Health and Administration, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru; Center for Health and the Global Environment, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States","Dostal, T., Center for One Health Research, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States; Meisner, J., Center for One Health Research, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States, Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States; Munaycoid, C., Centro Nacional de Epidemiología, Prevención y Control de Enfermedades, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru; García, P.J., School of Public Health and Administration, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru; Cárcamo, C., School of Public Health and Administration, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru; Lu, J.E.P., School of Public Health and Administration, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru; Morin, C., Center for Health and the Global Environment, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States; Frisbie, L., Center for One Health Research, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States; Rabinowitz, P.M., Center for One Health Research, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States",,Aedes aegypti; Article; climate change; comparative study; controlled study; correlation analysis; dengue; disease simulation; disease surveillance; disease transmission; fatigue; geographic distribution; hierarchical clustering; human; immunoassay; mathematical analysis; mosquito vector; nonhuman; outcome assessment; polymerase chain reaction; precipitation; risk factor; seasonal variation; temperature sensitivity; time series analysis; vector control; virus transmission; animal; Bayes theorem; El Nino; epidemic; Peru; weather; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Dengue; Disease Outbreaks; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Humans; Peru; Weather,Aedes aegypti;Article;climate change;comparative study;controlled study;correlation analysis;dengue;disease simulation;disease surveillance;disease transmission;fatigue;geographic distribution;hierarchical clustering;human;immunoassay;mathematical analysis;mosquito vector;nonhuman;outcome assessment;polymerase chain reaction;precipitation;risk factor;seasonal variation;temperature sensitivity;time series analysis;vector control;virus transmission;animal;Bayes theorem;El Nino;epidemic;Peru;weather;Animals;Disease Outbreaks;El Nino-Southern Oscillation;Humans,"Meisner, J.; Center for One Health Research, United States; email: meisnerj@uw.edu",,,,,,Public Library of Science,19352727,,,35771874,English,PLoS.

Publicly available datasets were used. ,Yes,"Background: The COVID 19 epidemic submerged many health systems in the Amazon. The objective of the present study was to focus on the epidemic curves of the COVID 19 epidemic in different centers, and to look at testing and mortality data. Methods: Publicly available datasets were used. The log10 of the daily cumulated number of cases starting from the day the territory reached 100 cumulated cases was plotted to compare the magnitude, shape and slope of the different curves. The maximum daily testing efforts were plotted for each territory in relation to the maximum daily number of diagnoses. The case fatality rate was computed by dividing the number of COVID 19 deaths by the number of confirmed cases. Results: In the Amazonian regions in general the speed of growth was generally lower than in Europe or the USA, or Southern Brazil. Whereas, countries like South Korea or New Zealand “broke” the curve relatively rapidly the log linear trajectory seemed much longer with signs of a decline in growth rate as of early July 2020. After a very slow start, French Guiana had the lowest slope when compared to other Amazonian territories with significant epidemics. The Amazonian states of Roraima, Amazonas, Parà, and Amapà had among the highest number of cases and deaths per million inhabitants in the world. French Guiana had significantly fewer deaths relative to its number of confirmed cases than other Amazonian territories. French Guiana had a late epidemic surge with intense testing scale-up often exceeding 4,000 persons tested daily per million inhabitants. Brazil was an outlier with low daily testing levels in relation to the number of daily diagnoses. Conclusions: There were marked heterogeneities mortality rates suggesting that socioeconomic, political factors, and perhaps ethnic vulnerability led to striking outcome differences in this Amazonian context. © Copyright © 2021 Nacher, Rousseau, Succo, Andrieu, Gaillet, Michaud, Servas, Douine, Schaub, Adenis, Demar, Abboud, Epelboin and Djossou.","The Epidemiology of COVID 19 in the Amazon and the Guianas: Similarities, Differences, and International Comparisons","Nacher M., Rousseau C., Succo T., Andrieu A., Gaillet M., Michaud C., Servas V., Douine M., Schaub R., Adenis A., Demar M., Abboud P., Epelboin L., Djossou F.",2021,Frontiers in Public Health,9,,586299,,,,8,10.3389/fpubh.2021.586299,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103152659&doi=10.3389%2ffpubh.2021.586299&partnerID=40&md5=3025a52fe9d2da6240d8ff7d1d187fe7,"Centre d'Investigation Clinique Antilles Guyane, INSERM 1424, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Département Formation Recherche (DFR) Santé, Université de Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana; Santé Publique France, Cayenne, French Guiana; Centres Délocalisés de Prévention et de Soins, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Unité Mixte de Recherche Tropical Biome et Immuno-Pathologie (UMR TBIP), Université de Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana; Service des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana","Nacher, M., Centre d'Investigation Clinique Antilles Guyane, INSERM 1424, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana, Département Formation Recherche (DFR) Santé, Université de Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana; Rousseau, C., Santé Publique France, Cayenne, French Guiana; Succo, T., Santé Publique France, Cayenne, French Guiana; Andrieu, A., Santé Publique France, Cayenne, French Guiana; Gaillet, M., Centres Délocalisés de Prévention et de Soins, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Michaud, C., Centres Délocalisés de Prévention et de Soins, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Servas, V., Centres Délocalisés de Prévention et de Soins, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Douine, M., Centre d'Investigation Clinique Antilles Guyane, INSERM 1424, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Schaub, R., Centre d'Investigation Clinique Antilles Guyane, INSERM 1424, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Adenis, A., Centre d'Investigation Clinique Antilles Guyane, INSERM 1424, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Demar, M., Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana, Unité Mixte de Recherche Tropical Biome et Immuno-Pathologie (UMR TBIP), Université de Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana; Abboud, P., Service des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Epelboin, L., Service des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Djossou, F., Département Formation Recherche (DFR) Santé, Université de Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana, Unité Mixte de Recherche Tropical Biome et Immuno-Pathologie (UMR TBIP), Université de Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana, Service des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana",Amazon; COVID 19; epidemiology; Guiana shield; mortality; testing; vulnerable populations,Brazil; cause of death; comparative study; epidemic; epidemiology; Europe; French Guiana; human; international cooperation; mortality; North America; Brazil; Cause of Death; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemics; Europe; French Guiana; Humans; Internationality; North America; SARS-CoV-2,Amazon;COVID 19;epidemiology;Guiana shield;mortality;testing;vulnerable populations;Brazil;cause of death;comparative study;epidemic;Europe;French Guiana;human;international cooperation;North America;COVID-19;Disease Outbreaks;Epidemics;Humans;Internationality;SARS-CoV-2,"Nacher, M.; Centre d'Investigation Clinique Antilles Guyane, French Guiana; email: mathieu.nacher66@gmail.com

,No,"Epidemic outbreaks represent a significant concern for the current state of global health, particularly in Brazil, the epicentre of several vector-borne disease outbreaks and where epidemic control is still a challenge for the scientific community. Data science techniques applied to epidemics are usually made via standard statistical and modelling approaches, which do not always lead to reliable predictions, especially when the data lacks a piece of reliable surveillance information needed for precise parameter estimation. In particular, dengue outbreaks reported over the past years raise concerns for global health care, and thus novel data-driven methods are necessary to predict the emergence of outbreaks. In this work, we propose a parameter-free approach based on geometric and topological techniques, which extracts geometrical and topological invariants as opposed to statistical summaries used in established methods. Specifically, our procedure generates a time-varying network from a time-series of new epidemic cases based on synthetic time-series and real dengue data across several districts of Recife, the fourth-largest urban area in Brazil. Subsequently, we use the Euler characteristic (EC) to extract key topological invariant of the epidemic time-varying network and we finally compared the results with the effective reproduction number (R ( t )) for each data set. Our results unveil a strong correlation between epidemic outbreaks and the EC. In fact, sudden changes in the EC curve preceding and/or during an epidemic period emerge as a warning sign for an outbreak in the synthetic data, the EC transitions occur close to the periods of epidemic transitions, which is also corroborated. In the real dengue data, where data is intrinsically noise, the EC seems to show a better sign-to-noise ratio once compared to R ( t ). In analogy with later studies on noisy data by using EC in positron emission tomography scans, the EC estimates the number of regions with high connectivity in the epidemic network and thus has potential to be a signature of the emergence of an epidemic state. Our results open the door to the development of alternative/complementary topological and geometrical data-driven methods to characterise vector-borne disease outbreaks, specially when the conventional epidemic surveillance methods are not effective in a scenario of extreme noise and lack of robustness in the data.",The Euler characteristic as a topological marker for outbreaks in vector-borne disease,"de Souza, D.B., dos Santos, E.F., Santos, F.A.N.",2022,JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT,2022,12,123501,,,23,0,10.1088/1742-5468/aca0e5,,"[de Souza, Danillo Barros] Basque Ctr Appl Math BCAM, Math Computat & Expt Neurosci Team, Bilbao 48009, Spain; [de Souza, Danillo Barros; dos Santos, Everlon Figueiroa; Santos, Fernando A.

,No,"European forests are threatened by increasing numbers of invasive pests and pathogens. Over the past century, Lecanosticta acicola, a foliar pathogen predominantly of Pinus spp., has expanded its range globally, and is increasing in impact. Lecanosticta acicola causes brown spot needle blight, resulting in premature defoliation, reduced growth, and mortality in some hosts. Originating from southern regions of North American, it devastated forests in the USA's southern states in the early twentieth century, and in 1942 was discovered in Spain. Derived from Euphresco project ‘Brownspotrisk,’ this study aimed to establish the current distribution of Lecanosticta species, and assess the risks of L. acicola to European forests. Pathogen reports from the literature, and new/ unpublished survey data were combined into an open-access geo-database (http://www.portalofforestpathology.com), and used to visualise the pathogen's range, infer its climatic tolerance, and update its host range. Lecanosticta species have now been recorded in 44 countries, mostly in the northern hemisphere. The type species, L. acicola, has increased its range in recent years, and is present in 24 out of the 26 European countries where data were available. Other species of Lecanosticta are largely restricted to Mexico and Central America, and recently Colombia. The geo-database records demonstrate that L. acicola tolerates a wide range of climates across the northern hemisphere, and indicate its potential to colonise Pinus spp. forests across large swathes of the Europe. Preliminary analyses suggest L. acicola could affect 62% of global Pinus species area by the end of this century, under climate change predictions. Although its host range appears slightly narrower than the similar Dothistroma species, Lecanosticta species were recorded on 70 host taxa, mostly Pinus spp., but including, Cedrus and Picea spp. Twenty-three, including species of critical ecological, environmental and economic significance in Europe, are highly susceptible to L. acicola, suffering heavy defoliation and sometimes mortality. Variation in apparent susceptibility between reports could reflect variation between regions in the hosts’ genetic make-up, but could also reflect the significant variation in L. acicola populations and lineages found across Europe. This study served to highlight significant gaps in our understanding of the pathogen's behaviour. Lecanosticta acicola has recently been downgraded from an A1 quarantine pest to a regulated non quarantine pathogen, and is now widely distributed across Europe. With a need to consider disease management, this study also explored global BSNB strategies, and used Case Studies to summarise the tactics employed to date in Europe. © 2023 The Authors","The increasing threat to European forests from the invasive foliar pine pathogen, Lecanosticta acicola","Tubby K., Adamcikova K., Adamson K., Akiba M., Barnes I., Boron P., Braganca H., Bulgakov T., Burgdorf N., Capretti P., Cech T., Cleary M., Davydenko K., Drenkhan R., Elvira-Recuenco M., Enderle R., Gardner J., Georgieva M., Ghelardini L., Husson C., Iturritxa E., Markovskaja S., Mesanza N., Ogris N., Oskay F., Piskur B., Queloz V., Raitelaityte K., Raposo R., Soukainen M., Strasser L., Vahalik P., Vester M., Mullett M.",2023,Forest Ecology and Management,536,,120847,,,,0,10.1016/j.foreco.2023.120847,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151414973&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2023.120847&partnerID=40&md5=f8cdcf34d479de8fcd4201e3fec932cb,"Forest Research, Alice Holt Lodge, Surrey, Farnham, GU10 4LH, United Kingdom; Department of Plant Pathology and Mycology, Institute of Forest Ecology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Akademická 2, Nitra, 94901, Slovakia; Institute of Forestry and Engineering, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Tartu, Estonia; Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, 1 Matsunosato, Ibaraki, Tsukuba, 305-8687, Japan; Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute (FABI), University of Pretoria, Pretoria, 0002, South Africa; Department Forest Ecosystems Protection, University of Agriculture in Kraków, Kraków, 31-425, Poland; Instituto Nacional de Investigação Agrária e Veterinária I.

,No,"Background: Most cancer patients, under active treatment or not, are sedentary, despite increasing scientific and clinical understanding of the benefits of exercise and physical activity, such as improving quality of life, limiting disease symptoms, decreasing cancer recurrence, and increasing overall survival. Studies have shown that both supervised exercise and unsupervised physical activity programs have low adherence and limited long-term benefits among cancer survivors. Therefore, interventions focused on increasing physical activity levels have clinical and psychological relevance. The present study will examine the feasibility and efficacy of an intervention that combines supervised group exercise with active lifestyle recommendations, analyzing its clinical, psychological, physiological, functional, and immunological effects in breast cancer survivors. Methods: Women aged 35–75 years who have completed chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery for breast cancer will be recruited from the Cancer Institute of the State of Sao Paulo (ICESP) and take part in a 16-week, parallel-group, randomized, and controlled trial. They will receive a booklet with recommendations for achieving a physically active lifestyle by increasing overall daily movement and undertaking at least 150 min/week of structured exercise. Then, they will be randomized into two groups: the supervised group will take part in two canoeing group exercise sessions every week, and the unsupervised group will increase their overall physical activity level by any means, such as active commuting, daily activities, or home-based exercise. Primary outcome includes aerobic capacity. Secondary outcomes are physical activity, physical functioning, self-reported quality of life, fatigue, presence of lymphedema, body composition, immune function, adherence to physical activity guidelines, and perceptions of self-image. Discussion: Results should contribute to advance knowledge on the impact of a supervised group exercise intervention to improve aspects related to health, physical functioning, and quality of life in female breast cancer survivors.

ecological time series study of mammograms and breast biopsies in women aged 30 years or older from an open-access data set of the Public Health System of Brazil,Yes,"Objectives: The overload of health services because of the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the population's access to treatment and prevention of other diseases. This study aimed to identify whether there was a change in the trend of breast biopsies and their direct costs during the COVID-19 pandemic in a developing country's public and universal healthcare system.Methods: This was an ecological time series study of mammograms and breast biopsies in women aged 30 years or older from an open-access data set of the Public Health System of Brazil from 2017 to July 2021.Results: In 2020, there was a reduction of-40.9% in mammograms and-7.9% in breast biopsies compared with the pre-pandemic period. From 2017 to 2020, there was an increase in the breast biopsies ratio per mammogram (1.37%-2.55%), the percentage of Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) IV and V mammograms (0.79%-1.14%), and the annual direct cost of breast biopsies (Brazilian Real 3 477410.00 to Brazilian Real 7 334 910.00). In the time series, the negative impact of the pandemic was lower on BI-RADS IV to V mammograms than on BI-RADS 0 to III. There was an association between the trend of breast biopsies and BI-RADS IV to V mammography.Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic harmed the increasing trend of breast biopsies, their total direct costs, BI-RADS 0 to III and IV to V mammograms, observed in the prepandemic period.

This study aimed to assess the pandemic impact on the trend of mammograms, breast biopsies, and breast cancer stage at diagnosis according to age group. Methods: This was an ecological time series study by inflection point regression model. We used data from women aged between 30 and 49, 50 and 69, and 70 years or more available in an open-access dataset of the Brazilian public healthcare system (2017-2021). We analyzed the trend of the variables in the pre-pandemic and the pandemic effect on the total time series. Results: The decreasing or stationary trend of mammograms in the pre-pandemic has changed to a decreasing trend in the total time series in all age groups. Before the pandemic, the increasing trend of breast biopsies has changed to stationary in the total time series in all age groups. The increasing trend of tumors at stages O to II in the pre-pandemic has changed to decreasing or stationary in the total time series. Finally, the increasing trend of tumors at stage III or IV remained increasing in the total time series in all age groups. Conclusion: The pandemic has changed the stationary or increasing trend to a decreasing or stationary trend of mammograms, breast biopsies, and tumors at stages 0 to II but has not influenced the increasing trend of tumors at stages III and IV in all age groups.",The New Coronavirus Pandemic and the Trend of Breast Cancer Diagnosis According to Age Group: Total and Interrupted Time Series Study,"Hyeda, A., da Costa, E.S.M., Kowalski, S.C.",2023,MEDICAL PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE,,,,,,21,0,10.1159/000530179,,"[Hyeda, Adriano; da Costa, Elide Sbardellotto Mariano; Kowalski, Sergio Candido] Fed Univ Parana UFPR, Postgrad Program Internal Med & Hlth Sci, Curitiba, PR, Brazil; [Hyeda, Adriano] Fed Univ Parana UFPR, Postgrad Program Internal Med & Hlth Sci, Gen Carneiro St, 181, Cent Bldg-11th Floor, BR-80060900 Curitiba, PR, Brazil",,,MORTALITY; IMPACT; DELAYS,MORTALITY;IMPACT;DELAYS,adriano.hyeda@ufpr.br,,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,KARGER,1011-7571,,,36927744,English,MED PRIN PRACT,Article; Early Access,WoS,General & Internal Medicine,WOS:000955104100001,,Brazil,ufpr.br,Fed Univ Parana UFPR,"Fed Univ Parana UFPR, Brazil","Hyeda, Adriano; da Costa, Elide Sbardellotto Mariano; Kowalski, Sergio Candido",,
,No,"Background: Comorbid mental illnesses and substance use disorders are associated with adverse criminal, social, and health outcomes. Yet, their burden is not reliably known among prison populations. We therefore aimed to estimate the prevalence of comorbid serious mental illnesses and substance use disorders (dual disorders) among people in prison worldwide. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched 15 electronic databases (ASSIA, CAB Abstracts, Criminal Justice Database, Embase, Global Health, Global Index Medicus, IBSS, MEDLINE, NCJRS, PAIS Index, PsycINFO, Russian Science Citation Index, Scielo, Social Services Abstracts, and Web of Science) and the grey literature (Open Grey and ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global) for studies reporting the prevalence of serious mental illnesses and substance use disorders in prison populations published between Jan 1, 1980, and Sept 25, 2021, and contacted the authors of relevant studies. Empirical studies among unselected adult prison populations that applied representative sampling strategies and validated diagnostic instruments, and either reported the prevalence of dual disorders or had authors who could provide prevalence data in correspondence, were included. Two reviewers (GB and SDL) independently extracted data from the eligible studies; both current (up to 1 year) and lifetime prevalence were extracted, if available. We sought summary estimates. Our primary outcomes were comorbid non-affective psychosis with substance use disorders and comorbid major depression with substance use disorders. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis, explored between-sample heterogeneity with meta-regression, and calculated odds ratios (ORs) to assess bidirectional relationships between mental and substance use disorders. Risk of bias was assessed by use of a standard tool. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020207301. Findings: Of 11 346 records screened, we identified 34 studies reporting the prevalence of dual disorders among individuals in prison and received unpublished prevalence data for 16 studies, totalling 50 eligible studies and 24 915 people. The mean quality score of included studies was 7·8 (SD 1·2). We found that 3·5% (95% CI 2·2–5·0) had current non-affective psychosis with any comorbid substance use disorder, representing 443 (49·2%) of 900 people with non-affective psychosis, and 9·1% (5·6–13·3) had current major depression and comorbid substance use disorders, representing 1105 (51·6%) of 2143 people with major depression. Between-sample heterogeneity was high (I2&gt;80%). People in prison with current non-affective psychosis were significantly more likely to have substance use disorders compared with those without (OR 1·7, 95% CI 1·4–2·2). People with major depression had higher odds of substance use disorders than those without (1·6, 1·3–2·0). Interpretation: Around half of the prison population with non-affective psychosis or major depression have a comorbid substance use disorder.

,No,"A cDNA clone (designated CaIRL) encoding an isoflavone reductase-like protein from coffee (Coffea arabica) was retrieved during a search for genes showing organ/tissue-specific expression among the expressed sequence tags (EST) of the Brazilian coffee EST database. The CaIRL cDNA contains a single open reading frame of 946 nucleotides (nt) encoding 314 amino acids (predicted molecular weight of 34 kDa). Several features identified the predicted CaIRL protein as a new member of the PIP family of NADPH-dependent reductases. Expression studies demonstrated that CaIRL is expressed exclusively in coffee leaves and its transcript level is markedly increased in response to fungal infection and mechanical injury. Analysis of transgenic tobacco plants harboring a CaIRL 5'-flanking region (862 nt) fused to uidA reporter gene (GUS) confirmed the responsiveness of the putative promoter to abiotic stress in wounded leaves. In turn, a 5' deletion to -404 completely abolished promoter activation by abiotic stimulus in transgenic plants. The lack of GUS expression in non-wounded leaf tissues in transgenic tobacco was in contrast to the basal level of CaIRL expression observed in non-stressed healthy coffee leaves.",The promoter of a gene encoding an isoflavone reductase-like protein in coffee (Coffea arabica) drives a stress-responsive expression in leaves,"Brandalise, M., Severino, F.E., Maluf, M.P., Maia, I.G.",2009,PLANT CELL REPORTS,28,11,,1699,1708,10,23,10.1007/s00299-009-0769-0,,"[Brandalise, Marcos; Severino, Fabio E.; Maia, Ivan G.] UNESP, Dept Genet, Inst Biociencias, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Brandalise, Marcos; Maluf, Mirian P.] Inst Agron Campinas, Ctr Cafe Alcides Carvalho, EMBRAPA Cafe, Campinas, SP, Brazil",,Coffee; Promoter; Tissue-specificity; Gene expression; Isoflavone-like proteins,RESISTANCE RESPONSES; DISEASE RESISTANCE; PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS; ELICITOR; TOBACCO; PLANTS; PCR; BIOSYNTHESIS; PATTERNS; ELEMENTS,Coffee;Promoter;Tissue-specificity;Gene expression;Isoflavone-like proteins;RESISTANCE RESPONSES;DISEASE RESISTANCE;PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS;ELICITOR;TOBACCO;PLANTS;PCR;BIOSYNTHESIS;PATTERNS;ELEMENTS,igmaia@ibb.unesp.br,,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",,,,SPRINGER,0721-7714,,,19756631,English,PLANT CELL REP,Article,WoS,Plant Sciences,WOS:000271905900009,2-s2.0-77950350686,Brazil,ibb.unesp.br,UNESP;Inst Agron Campinas,"UNESP, Brazil;Inst Agron Campinas, Brazil","Brandalise, Marcos; Severino, Fabio E.; Maluf, Mirian P.; Maia, Ivan G.",,
,No,"This study analyzed the consequences of the disordered expansion of Dentistry courses on the distribution of professionals, the job market, and limitations of the National System of Higher Education Assessment (SINAES) developed as a guarantee of education quality. This observational, descriptive, and analytical study used secondary data from several official databases. The number of courses was obtained from the e-MEC registry. From the Higher Education Census, the study collected historical series of courses offered, number of candidates per open seat, number of individuals who initiated and completed the course, and information about professors in the public and private schools. The reports related to Dentistry courses from the National Health Council were also analyzed. The performance of undergraduate students was assessed from synthesis reports of Enade from 2004 to 2016. The number of dentists and their regional distribution was based on the Federal Dental Council, and Brazilian population and gross domestic product were collected from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Dentistry courses in Brazil grew exponentially from 1856 to 2020; among the 544 authorized courses, 82 currently have not yet started their activities. The fast expansion of courses in Brazil has worsened the regional asymmetries in the supply of dentist, and the SINAES has not been able to fully assure the quality of Dentistry courses.

,No,"Objective The Xavante Longitudinal Health Study was developed to permit granular tracking of contemporary health challenges faced by indigenous communities in Brazil, taking into consideration ongoing historical processes that may be associated with increases in child undernutrition, adult obesity, and cardiovascular disease risks. Methods This was an open-cohort study with six semiannual data collection waves from 2009 to 2012. The study was undertaken in two Xavante villages, Pimentel Barbosa and Etenhiritipa, State of Mato Grosso, Central Brazil. No sampling technique was used. Data collection placed emphasis on growth and nutrition of children under five and nutrition status, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels of adolescents and adults. Results Baseline data collection began in July/August 2009 with a population census (656 individuals). Between the first and final waves, the study population increased by 17%. At baseline, stunting and wasting was elevated for most age groups <10 years. Overweight, obesity, and increased risk of metabolic complications were expressive among individuals >17 years, disproportionately affecting females. Anemia was elevated in most age groups, especially among females. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was moderate. The overall prevalence of high blood pressure was relatively low. Conclusions Our findings reveal marked health disparities relative to the Brazilian national population and a complex dietary health epidemiology involving the double burden of malnutrition, rapidly changing nutritional indicators, and elevated metabolic disease risk. The topically broad multidisciplinary focus permitted construction of the richest longitudinal data set of socio-epidemiological information for an indigenous population in Brazil.","The Xavante Longitudinal Health Study in Brazil: Objectives, design, and key results","Welch, J.R., Ferreira, A.A., Tavares, F.G., Lucena, J.R.M., de Oliveira, M.V.G., Santos, R.V., Coimbra, C.E.A.",2020,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY,32,2,e23339,,,12,5,10.1002/ajhb.23339,,"[Welch, James R.; Lucena, J.

,Yes,"Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the expected mortality, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no global, frequently-updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 94 countries and territories, openly available as the regularly-updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that in several worst-affected countries (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) the excess mortality was above 50% of the expected annual mortality. At the same time, in several other countries (Australia, New Zealand) mortality during the pandemic was below the usual level, presumably due to social distancing measures decreasing the non-COVID infectious mortality. Furthermore, we found that while many countries have been reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, some countries have been substantially underreporting their COVID-19 deaths (e.g. Nicaragua, Russia, Uzbekistan), sometimes by two orders of magnitude (Tajikistan). Our results highlight the importance of open and rapid all-cause mortality reporting for pandemic monitoring. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

,Yes,"Background: Helicobacter pylori infection can cause gastritis, gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, and gastric cancer. Its treatment involves different medications, but resistance to these treatments is increasing. It is currently considered a public health problem.Aims: to identify regimens used for H. pylori eradication by age group, year of treatment and geographical region of Colombia. Methods: A cross-sectional study that identified regimens used H. pylori eradication in outpatient consultations over a 6-year period based on a medication dispensing database of 8.5 million people affiliated to the Colombian Health System. The appropriate regimens were those that included a proton pump inhibitor, associated with two antibiotics recommended by clinical practice guidelines (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, moxiflox-acin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole, tinidazole, and furazolidone). Results: A total of 12,011 patients with a diagnosis of acid-peptic disease and H. pylori infection were identified, who had undergone 12,426 eradication treatment courses. Of these, 98.0% used a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and 91.1% used amoxicillin. A total of 56.1% of the regimens were considered adequate; of these, 42.0% were a combination of PPI, amoxicillin/ clarithromycin. This regimen predominated between 2015 and 2017 for all age groups.Conclusions: The management of H. pylori infection in the majority of patients is heterogeneous and inconsistent with current recommendations based on evidence of antimicrobial resistance.(c) 2022 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia.

,No,"Objective: There are limited studies on laparoscopy for benign hysterectomy in low- and middle-income countries. This article describes national trends in modes of hysterectomy in Brazil and compares outcomes by regions and health sectors. Materials and Methods: This was a cross sectional retrospective analysis of benign hysterectomies from open-access national databases (public sector: 2008-2017; private sector: 2016) in Brazil. Variables examined included the modes (vaginal, abdominal, and laparoscopic) of hysterectomies, geographic regions, mortality rates, and lengths of stay (LOS). Results: Benign hysterectomies decreased by 19.2% over 10 years. The proportion of abdominal surgeries increased from 85% to 88%. Despite an increase in laparoscopic surgeries (0.2-0.9%), minimally invasive surgery (vaginal and laparoscopic) decreased (14.7%-12.6%), largely driven by a drop in vaginal cases (14.5%-11.7%). More laparoscopic hysterectomies were performed in the private sector compared to the public sector (11% versus 1%; p < 0.001). There were significant geographic disparities, with 17% of hysterectomies in the private sector performed laparoscopically in the south compared to 9% in the northeast (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Trends in modes of hysterectomies have changed. There are regional inequities, with wealthier regions accessing more laparoscopic surgery. Understanding the trends and factors affecting access to laparoscopy is essential for ensuring equitable access to high-quality gynecologic care.

"Through the use of datasets made publicly available by the Federal Government of Brazil, a new dataset was generated with municipality-level socioeconomic data and a PTB occurrence rate",Yes,"Preterm birth (PTB) is a phenomenon that brings risks and challenges for the survival of the newborn child. Despite many advances in research, not all the causes of PTB are already clear. It is understood that PTB risk is multi-factorial and can also be associated with socioeconomic factors. Thereby, this article seeks to use unsupervised learning techniques to stratify PTB risk in Brazil using only socioeconomic data. Through the use of datasets made publicly available by the Federal Government of Brazil, a new dataset was generated with municipality-level socioeconomic data and a PTB occurrence rate. This dataset was processed using various unsupervised learning techniques, such as k-means, principal component analysis (PCA), and density-based spatial clustering of ap-plications with noise (DBSCAN). After validation, four clusters with high levels of PTB occurrence were discovered, as well as three with low levels. The clusters with high PTB were comprised mostly of municipalities with lower levels of education, worse quality of public services—such as basic sanitation and garbage collection—and a less white population. The regional distribution of the clusters was also observed, with clusters of high PTB located mostly in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil. The results indicate a positive influence of the quality of life and the offer of public services on the reduction in PTB risk. © 2022 by the authors.

,No,"Introduction: Previous cross-sectional studies could establish an association between prevalence of self-reported wheeze and urban–rural environment, but the impact of urbanization on meaningful outcomes of asthma for public health is not established yet. Objectives: Evaluate the effect of urbanization on asthma burden. Methods: A time series study of 5,505 Brazilian municipalities. The unit of analysis was the municipality. Two time frames were evaluated: from 1999 to 2001 and from 2009 to 2011. Trends from the first to the second time frame were evaluated. Governmental databases were the source of information. Multivariate binary logistic regression models were used. Results: In the age range from 5 to 24 years old, municipalities with increase in the proportion of individuals living in urban area had lower odds to reduce hospital admission rate from asthma (OR:.93) and lower odds to reduce death rate from asthma (OR:.88). In the age range from 25 to 39 years old, municipalities with increase in the proportion of individuals living in urban area had lower odds to reduce hospital admission rate from asthma (OR:.93) and lower odds to reduce death rate from asthma (OR:.82). Municipalities that increased access to physicians and that supplied inhaled corticosteroids free of charge for asthma since year 2003 had increased odds to reduce hospital admission and death rates from asthma. Conclusions: Increase in urban population was associated with lower odds to reduce hospital admission and death rates from asthma in children and young adults living in a transition society. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Urbanization is associated with increased asthma morbidity and mortality in Brazil,"Ponte E.V., Cruz A.A., Athanazio R., Carvalho-Pinto R., Fernandes F.L.A., Barreto M.L., Stelmach R.",2018,Clinical Respiratory Journal,12,2,,410,417,,31,10.1111/crj.12530,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994460472&doi=10.1111%2fcrj.12530&partnerID=40&md5=ff4909be9d56a18eac5b1c7d71ee4d55,"Faculdade de Medicina de Jundiaí, Sao Paulo, Brazil; ProAR - Núcleo de Excelência em Asma, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Bahia, Brazil; Pulmonary Divison-Heart Institute, Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Instituto de Saúde Coletiva, UFBA, Brazil","Ponte, E.V., Faculdade de Medicina de Jundiaí, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Cruz, A.A., ProAR - Núcleo de Excelência em Asma, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Bahia, Brazil; Athanazio, R., Pulmonary Divison-Heart Institute, Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Carvalho-Pinto, R., Pulmonary Divison-Heart Institute, Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Fernandes, F.L.A., Pulmonary Divison-Heart Institute, Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Barreto, M.L., Instituto de Saúde Coletiva, UFBA, Brazil; Stelmach, R., Pulmonary Divison-Heart Institute, Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil",asthma; epidemiology; hospitalization; mortality; treatment; urbanization,"corticosteroid; corticosteroid; adolescent; adult; Article; asthma; Brazil; calculation; child; controlled study; hospital admission; human; influenza; longitudinal study; morbidity; mortality rate; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; risk reduction; time series analysis; trend study; urban area; urban population; urbanization; asthma; cost of illness; cross-sectional study; hospitalization; morbidity; mortality; preschool child; prevalence; self report; statistics and numerical data; trends; urbanization; young adult; Adolescent; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Asthma; Brazil; Child; Child, Preschool; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitalization; Humans; Morbidity; Mortality; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Self Report; Urban Population; Urbanization; Young Adult","asthma;epidemiology;hospitalization;mortality;treatment;urbanization;corticosteroid;adolescent;adult;Article;Brazil;calculation;child;controlled study;hospital admission;human;influenza;longitudinal study;morbidity;mortality rate;priority journal;risk assessment;risk factor;risk reduction;time series analysis;trend study;urban area;urban population;cost of illness;cross-sectional study;preschool child;prevalence;self report;statistics and numerical data;trends;young adult;Adrenal Cortex Hormones;Child, Preschool;Cross-Sectional Studies;Humans;Risk Factors","Ponte, E.V.; Faculdade de Medicina de JundiaíBrazil; email: evponte@yahoo.com.br",,,,,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,17526981,,,27400674,English,Clin.

,No,"Background: Urban areas are hot spots for human exposure to air pollution, which originates in large part from traffic. As the urban population continues to grow, a greater number of people risk exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) and its adverse, costly health effects. In many cities, there is a need and scope for air quality improvements through targeted policy interventions, which continue to grow including rapidly changing technologies. Objective: This systematic evidence map (SEM) examines and characterizes peer-reviewed evidence on urban-level policy interventions aimed at reducing traffic emissions and/or TRAP from on-road mobile sources, thus potentially reducing human exposures and adverse health effects and producing various co-benefits. Methods: This SEM follows a previously peer-reviewed and published protocol with minor deviations, explicitly outlined here. Articles indexed in Public Affairs Index, TRID, Medline and Embase were searched, limited to English, published between January 1, 2000, and June 1, 2020. Covidence was used to screen articles based on previously developed eligibility criteria. Data for included articles was extracted and manually documented into an Excel database. Data visualizations were created in Tableau. Results: We identified 7528 unique articles from database searches and included 376 unique articles in the final SEM. There were 58 unique policy interventions, and a total of 1,139 unique policy scenarios, comprising these interventions and different combinations thereof. The policy interventions fell under 6 overarching policy categories: 1) pricing, 2) land use, 3) infrastructure, 4) behavioral, 5) technology, and 6) management, standards, and services, with the latter being the most studied. For geographic location, 463 policy scenarios were studied in Europe, followed by 355 in Asia, 206 in North America, 57 in South America, 10 in Africa, and 7 in Australia. Alternative fuel technology was the most frequently studied intervention (271 times), followed by vehicle emission regulation (134 times). The least frequently studied interventions were vehicle ownership taxes, and studded tire regulations, studied once each. A mere 3 % of studies addressed all elements of the full-chain—traffic emissions, TRAP, exposures, and health. The evidence recorded for each unique policy scenario is hosted in an open-access, query-able Excel database, and a complementary interactive visualization tool. We showcase how users can find more about the effectiveness of the 1,139 included policy scenarios in reducing, increasing, having mixed or no effect on traffic emissions and/or TRAP. Conclusion: This is the first peer-reviewed SEM to compile international evidence on urban-level policy interventions to reduce traffic emissions and/or TRAP in the context of human exposure and health effects. We also documented reported enablers, barriers, and co-benefits. The open-access Excel database and interactive visualization tool can be valuable resources for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers. Future updates to this work are recommended.

,No,"BACKGROUND: In 2006, 848 persons died from tuberculosis (TB) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, corresponding to a mortality rate of 5.4 per 100 000 population. No specific TB death surveillance actions are currently in place in Brazil. SETTING: Two public general hospitals with large open emergency rooms in Rio de Janeiro City. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of TB death surveillance in detecting gaps in TB control. METHODS: We conducted a survey of TB deaths from September 2005 to August 2006. Records of TB-related deaths and deaths due to undefined causes were investigated. Complementary data were gathered from the mortality and TB notification databases. RESULTS: Seventy-three TB-related deaths were investigated. Transmission hazards were identified among fire-fighters, health care workers and in-patients. Management errors included failure to isolate suspected cases, to confirm TB, to correct drug doses in underweight patients and to trace contacts. Following the survey, 36 cases that had not previously been notified were included in the national TB notification database and the outcome of 29 notified cases was corrected. CONCLUSION: TB mortality surveillance can contribute to TB monitoring and evaluation by detecting correctable and specific programme- and hospital-based care errors, and by improving the accuracy of TB database reporting. Specific local and programmatic interventions can be proposed as a result.",Uses of tuberculosis mortality surveillance to identify programme errors and improve database reporting,"Selig, L., Guedes, R., Kritski, A., Spector, N., Silva, J.R.L.E., Braga, J.U., Trajman, A.",2009,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE,13,8,,982,988,7,11,,,"[Selig, L.] Serra dos Orgaos Univ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Selig, L.; Guedes, R.] Rio de Janeiro State Hlth Dept, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Kritski, A.; Spector, N.; Lapa e Silva, J.

,No,"Background: Research on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) has increased in recent decades, and significant need-gaps in diagnostic and treatment tools remain. Analysing bibliometric data from published research is a powerful method for revealing research efforts, partnerships and expertise. We aim to identify and map NTD research networks in Germany and their partners abroad to enable an informed and transparent evaluation of German contributions to NTD research. Methodology/Principal Findings: A SCOPUS database search for articles with German author affiliations that were published between 2002 and 2012 was conducted for kinetoplastid and helminth diseases. Open-access tools were used for data cleaning and scientometrics (OpenRefine), geocoding (OpenStreetMaps) and to create (Table2Net), visualise and analyse co-authorship networks (Gephi). From 26,833 publications from around the world that addressed 11 diseases, we identified 1,187 (4.4%) with at least one German author affiliation, and we processed 972 publications for the five most published-about diseases. Of those, we extracted 4,007 individual authors and 863 research institutions to construct co-author networks. The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil. Collaborations with partners on the African continent remain scattered. NTD research within Germany was distributed among 220 research institutions. We identified strong performers on an individual level by using classic parameters (number of publications, h-index) and social network analysis parameters (betweenness centrality). The research network characteristics varied strongly between diseases. Conclusions/Significance: The share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research. This finding underlines the need to identify barriers and expand Germany’s otherwise strong research activities towards NTDs. A geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, which were less involved in collaborations than high-income countries. Identifying knowledge hubs within individual researcher networks complements traditional scientometric indicators that are used to identify opportunities for collaboration. Using free tools to analyse research processes and output could facilitate data-driven health policies.

,No,"Objective: Describe a case series of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) after COVID-19 vaccination in Brazil that included ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Ad26.COV2.S and BNT162b2 vaccines, describing their clinical and laboratory characteristics. Methodology: Descriptive case series study using Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz/AstraZeneca Brazil and National Immunization Program/Ministry of Health (NIP/MoH) data on COVID-19 AEFI surveillance.We obtained patient-level data from pharmacovigilance for AEFI surveillance and used both the NIP/ MoH and Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz pharmacovigilance databases to create the study database. Thirty-nine cases of suspect VITT were included, 36 after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one after BNT162b2 and two after Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. All cases were based on meeting the Brighton Collaboration criteria for VITT. The primary outcomes were clinical and laboratory features, site of thrombosis, and anti-PF4 ELISA, when available.Results: Thirty-nine cases met the criteria, 38 of which were classified as level 1 and one as level 3 according to Brighton Collaboration. Most cases had the central nervous system (CNS) as the main site of thrombosis (21/39) and happened after the vaccine first dose (34/39). The median age of the cases was 41 years old (23 to 86 yo). Most of the cases (61.5%) occurred in women. The median interval between vaccination and onset of symptoms was 8 days (0-37 days). The platelet count and D-dimer count had median values of 34,000/lL and 19,235 lg FEU/L, respectively. The ELISA anti-PF4 antibody was positive in 18 samples. The overall mortality rate was 51% and was higher in cases of CNS thrombosis with intracerebral bleeding. Conclusion: Our case series shows that Brazilian VITT cases have similar clinical and laboratory profiles as demonstrated in the literature. Brazil has administered more than 300 million doses of COVID-19 vacci-nes (more than 110 million from ChAdOx1 nCoV-19). VITT seems to be a very rare but serious adverse event following COVID-19 immunization, especially adenoviral vector immunization. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Da-ta were collected using the CrowdTangle graphi-cal interface, based on search terms in Portuguese related to vaccines approved for use in Brazil and it included posts from public Facebook pages and open Instagram profiles made from January 1st, 2020, to December 31st, 2021. The database included 3,876,408 posts (2,901,457 on Facebook and 974,952 on Instagram). The results showed an alternation of Pfizer, CoronaVac, AstraZeneca, and Janssen vaccines as the focus of discussion, fol-lowing the public debate established in the country around the dilemmas and advances related to the development, production, distribution, and appli-cation of immunizing agents. References to insti-tutions involved in the acquisition and production of immunizing agents were also identified, such as the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the Butantan Institute, and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, pres-ent among the thousand social actors that most generated comments from users in both networks.

,No,"Background Accurate cause of death data are essential to guide health policy. However, mortality surveillance is limited in many low-income countries. In such settings, verbal autopsy (VA) is increasingly used to provide population-level cause of death data. VAs are now widely interpreted using the automated algorithms SmartVA and InterVA. Here we use conventional autopsy as the gold standard to validate SmartVA methodology. Methods This study included adult deaths from natural causes in Sao Paulo and Recife for which conventional autopsy was indicated. VA was conducted with a relative of the deceased using an amended version of the SmartVA instrument to suit the local context. Causes of death from VA were produced using the SmartVA-Analyze program. Physician coded verbal autopsy (PCVA), conducted on the same questionnaires, and Global Burden of Disease Study data were used as additional comparators. Cause of death data were grouped into 10 broad causes for the validation due to the real-world utility of VA lying in identifying broad population cause of death patterns. Findings The study included 2,060 deaths in Sao Paulo and 1,079 in Recife. The cause specific mortality fractions (CSMFs) estimated using SmartVA were broadly similar to conventional autopsy for: cardiovascular diseases (46.8% vs 54.0%, respectively), cancers (10.6% vs 11.4%), infections (7.0% vs 10.4%) and chronic respiratory disease (4.1% vs 3.7%), causes accounting for 76.1% of the autopsy dataset. The SmartVA CSMF estimates were lower than autopsy for ""Other NCDs"" (7.8% vs 14.6%) and higher for diabetes (13.0% vs 6.6%). CSMF accuracy of SmartVA compared to autopsy was 84.5%. CSMF accuracy for PCVA was 93.0%. Interpretation The results suggest that SmartVA can, with reasonable accuracy, predict the broad cause of death groups important to assess a population's epidemiological transition. VA remains a useful tool for understanding causes of death where medical certification is not possible. Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

,No,"Objectives: To measure basal metabolic rate (BMR) and to compare it with the values obtained from predictive equations in a sample of elderly (>= 60 y) women. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants and setting: Seventy-nine women living in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil enrolled in physical activity programs open to the community. Measurements: Anthropometric measures were obtained using standard procedures. Percent body fat (PBF) was assessed by DXA. BMR was measured (BMRm) by indirect calorimetry under standardized conditions and compared with BMR estimated by 14 predictive equations that included elderly individuals in their development. Results: Mean (+/- SD) age, BMI and PBF were 69.7 +/- 6.5 y, 27.2 +/- 4.6 kg/m(2) and 42.1 +/- 5.9%. BMRm (4188.3 +/- 707.2 kJ/day) was significantly lower than estimated BMR by all predictive equations, including the equation developed for the Niteroian adult population (4565.6 +/- 607.9 kJ/day). This population-specific equation provided the largest number of results within +/- 10% of BMRm and the lowest overestimation (10.6 +/- 15.4%), much lower than the results from the internationally recommended Schofield equation (27.2 +/- 17.6%). Regression of calf circumference (CC), age and body mass on BMRm provided similar estimates in comparison to models with fat-free mass (FFM). Conclusions: All predictive equations provided biased, inaccurate estimates of BMR values in comparison to BMRm. Anthropometry and body composition explained only approximately 50% of the variability of BMRm. New equations should account for the variability of organ-metabolic rates and underlying undetected health conditions in older individuals living in tropical regions.

Data from the Brazilian Registry of Cardiovascular Surgeries in Adults (BYPASS Registry) database.,Yes,"Objective: To analyze the profile and outcomes of patients who underwent valve heart surgery in Brazil, using information retrieved from the Brazilian Registry of Cardiovascular Surgeries in Adults (BYPASS Registry) database. Methods: This is a multicenter cohort study, evaluating 920 patients submitted to heart valve surgery. Demographics and postoperative clinical outcomes were assessed and compared to estimate mortality risk using the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE). Results: Isolated aortic valve replacement was the most frequently performed surgery (34%), followed by isolated mitral valve replacement (24.9%). Valve repair was performed in 21% of mitral procedures. Minimally invasive access was performed in 1.6% and the most frequent postoperative complications were arrhythmias (22.6%), infections (5.7%), and low-output syndrome (5.1%). Operations covered by the public health system accounted for 80.8% and the hospital mortality rate was 7.3%. Conclusion: The most frequent isolated valve surgery in Brazil is the aortic valve replacement by conventional open access and the rheumatic disease is still the main etiology for valve surgery.

,No,"Background Surgical interventions occur at lower rates in resource-poor settings, and complication and death rates following surgery are probably substantial but have not been well quantified. A deeper understanding of outcomes is a crucial step to ensure that high quality accompanies increased global access to surgical care. We aimed to assess surgical mortality following three common surgical procedures-caesarean delivery, appendectomy, and groin (inguinal and femoral) hernia repair-to quantify the potential risks of expanding access without simultaneously addressing issues of quality and safety. Methods We collected demographic, health, and economic data for 113 countries classified as low income or lower-middle income by the World Bank in 2005. We did a systematic review of Ovid, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Scopus from Jan 1, 2000, to Jan 15, 2015, to identify studies in these countries reporting all-cause mortality following the three commonly undertaken operations. Reports from governmental and other agencies were also identified and included. We modelled surgical mortality rates for countries without reported data using a two-step multiple imputation method. We first used a fully conditional specification (FCS) multiple imputation method to establish complete datasets for all missing variables that we considered potentially predictive of surgical mortality. We then used regression-based predictive mean matching imputation methods, specified within the multiple imputation FCS method, for selected predictors for each operation using the completed dataset to predict mortality rates along with confidence intervals for countries without reported mortality data. To account for variability in data availability, we aggregated results by subregion and estimated surgical mortality rates. Findings From an initial 1302 articles and reports identified, 247 full-text articles met our inclusion criteria, and 124 provided data for surgical mortality for at least one of the three selected operations. We identified 42 countries with mortality data for at least one of the three procedures. Median reported mortality was 7.9 per 1000 operations for caesarean delivery (IQR 2.8-19.9), 2.2 per 1000 operations for appendectomy (0.0-17.2), and 4.9 per 1000 operations for groin hernia (0.0-11.7). Perioperative mortality estimates by subregion ranged from 2.8 (South Asia) to 50.2 (East Asia) per 1000 caesarean deliveries, 2.4 (South Asia) to 54.0 (Central sub-Saharan Africa) per 1000 appendectomies, and 0.3 (Andean Latin America) to 25.5 (Southern sub-Saharan Africa) per 1000 hernia repairs.

,No,"Black carbon (BC) is a fraction of airborne PM2.5 emitted by combustion, causing deleterious effects on human health. Due to its abundance in cities, assessing personal exposure to BC is of utmost importance. Personal exposure and dose of six couples with different working routines were determined for 48 h based on 1-min mobile BC measurements and on ambient concentrations monitored simultaneously at home (outdoor) and at a suburban site. Although couples spent on average ~ 10 h together at home, the routine of each individual in other microenvironments led to 3–55% discrepancies in exposure between partners. The location of the residences and background concentrations accounted for the differences in inter-couple exposure. The overall average exposure and dose by gender were not statistically different. The personal exposure and dose calculated with datasets from fixed sites were lower than the calculations using data from mobile measurements, with the largest divergences (between four and nine times) in the transport category. Even though the individuals spent only 7% of the time commuting, this activity contributed to between 17 and 20% of the integrated exposure and inhaled dose, respectively. On average, exposure was highest on bus trips, while pedestrians and bus passengers had lower doses. Open windows elevated the in-car exposure and dose four times compared to settings with closed windows. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Variations in individuals’ exposure to black carbon particles during their daily activities: a screening study in Brazil,"Carvalho A.M., Krecl P., Targino A.C.",2018,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,25,19,,18412,18423,,22,10.1007/s11356-018-2045-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046016706&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-018-2045-8&partnerID=40&md5=154068a986ab05bc347601ba8ccd6a0f,"Graduate Program in Environmental Engineering, Federal University of Technology, Av.

RESULTS: Most patients were female and adults. A total of 66,577 varicose vein surgeries were performed in public hospitals and outpatient clinics in Sao Paulo, with a statistically significant increase for both unilateral (p=0.003) and bilateral (p<0.001) procedures. Since 2016, unilateral procedures have been performed more frequently than bilateral procedures. Most procedures were associated with same-day (54.8%) or next-day (32%) discharge. The in-hospital mortality rate was 0.0045%. The total amount reimbursed was $20,693,437.94, corresponding to a mean value of $310.82 per procedure.CONCLUSION: Surgeries to treat chronic vein disease totaled 66,577 in 11 years, demanding $20,693,437.94 from the public health system. The majority of treated patients were female, over 40 years of age, and local residents. Procedure rates have increased over the years.

,No,"Introduction Humanitarian emergencies, of either natural or anthropogenic origins, are equivalent to major disasters, which can lead to population displacement, food insecurity and health system disruptions. Almost two-thirds of people affected by humanitarian emergencies inhabit malaria endemic regions, particularly the WHO African Region, which currently accounts for 93% and 94% of malaria cases and deaths, respectively. As of late 2020, the United Nations Refugee Agency estimates that there are globally 79.5 million forcibly displaced people, including 45.7 million internally displaced people, 26 million refugees, 4.2 million asylum-seekers and 3.6 million Venezuelans displaced abroad. Methods and analyses A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted to evaluate the impact of different vector control interventions on malaria disease burden during humanitarian emergencies. Published and grey literatures will be systematically retrieved from 10 electronic databases and 3 clinical trials registries. A systematic approach to screening, reviewing and data extraction will be applied based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Two review authors will independently assess full-text copies of potentially relevant articles based on inclusion criteria. Included studies will be assessed for risk of bias according to Cochrane and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Eligible studies with reported or measurable risk ratios or ORs with 95% CIs will be included in a meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses, including per study design, emergency phase and primary mode of intervention, may be performed if substantial heterogeneity is encountered. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to perform secondary analyses of existing anonymous data. Study findings will be disseminated via open-access publications in peer-reviewed journals, presentations to stakeholders and international policy makers, and will contribute to the latest WHO guidelines for malaria control during humanitarian emergencies.

,No,"Emission inventories are the quantification of pollutants from different sources. They provide important information not only for climate and weather studies but also for urban planning and environmental health protection. We developed an open-source model (called Vehicular Emissions Inventory-VEIN v0.2.2) that provides high-resolution vehicular emissions inventories for different fields of studies. We focused on vehicular sources at street and hourly levels due to the current lack of information about these sources, mainly in developing countries. The type of emissions covered by VEIN are exhaust (hot and cold) and evaporative considering the deterioration of the factors. VEIN also performs speciation and incorporates functions to generate and spatially allocate emissions databases. It allows users to load their own emission factors, but it also provides emission factors from the road transport model (Copert), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Brazilian databases. The VEIN model reads, distributes by age of use and extrapolates hourly traffic data, and it estimates emissions hourly and spatially. Based on our knowledge, VEIN is the first bottom-up vehicle emissions software that allows input to the WRF-Chem model. Therefore, the VEIN model provides an important, easy and fast way of elaborating or analyzing vehicular emissions inventories under different scenarios. The VEIN results can be used as an input for atmospheric models, health studies, air quality standardizations and decision making. © 2018 Author(s).",VEIN v0.2.2: an R package for bottom-up vehicular emissions inventories,"Ibarra-Espinosa S., Ynoue R., O'sullivan S., Pebesma E., De Fatima Andrade M., Osses M.",2018,Geoscientific Model Development,11,6,,2209,2229,,46,10.5194/gmd-11-2209-2018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048652978&doi=10.5194%2fgmd-11-2209-2018&partnerID=40&md5=bbfb17c3d8b6ef861c45db5501613821,"Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Universidade de São Paulo, Rua do Matão 1226, São Paulo, SP, Brazil; Department of Pathology, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de São Paulo, Av.

,Yes,"Over the last two decades, video-assisted surgery has become the preferential access route for many procedures. Despite cholecystectomy being the laparoscopic procedure most frequently performed in Brazilian public hospitals from 2008 to 2012, the lack of population-based studies led us to conduct a survey on the prevalence of video-assisted surgery in the treatment of patients using the Sistema Aenico de SaA(0)de (SUS) (Unified Health System), which is the universal, free, and public healthcare system of Brazil. By analyzing the DATASUS (national public health registry database), the prevalence of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and open cholecystectomy (OC) was calculated in the period from January to December in 2008, 2010 and 2012, taking into consideration their geographic distribution throughout Brazil. At the end of the study period, an increase in the number of laparoscopic cholecystectomies was observed, with a variation of 125.7 %. However, OC was more prevalent despite an increase in the use of video-assisted surgery over the 5-year study period, increasing from 12 to 25 % in 2012. In spite of a trend toward increased use of video-assisted surgery for treating SUS patients during the period under study, the data from 2012 are still far from being ideal. For this population, OC via laparotomy is still the most prevalent option in all regions. This information must encourage the Brazilian surgical societies to push for an improvement in the supply of the treatment provided by the public health system.",Video-Assisted Surgery Implementation in the Public Health System of a Developing Country,"Olijnyk, J.G., Cavazzola, L.T., de Aguilar-Nascimento, J.E., Nacul, M.P., Almeida, E.C.E.",2014,WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY,38,8,,1912,1916,5,2,10.1007/s00268-014-2493-3,,"[Olijnyk, Jose Gustavo; Cavazzola, Leandro Totti; Nacul, Miguel Prestes] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Surg, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [de Aguilar-Nascimento, Jose Eduardo] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Dept Surg, Cuiaba, MT, Brazil; [Couto e Almeida Filho, Elias] Ctr Ensino & Treinamento Expt Ciencias Saude Cetr, Dept Expt Surg, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",,,LAPAROSCOPIC CHOLECYSTECTOMY,LAPAROSCOPIC CHOLECYSTECTOMY,olijnyk.jg@gmail.com,,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",,,,SPRINGER,0364-2313,,,24615611,English,WORLD J SURG,Article,WoS,Surgery,WOS:000338639300007,2-s2.0-84903791823,Brazil,gmail.com,Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul;Univ Fed Mato Grosso;Ctr Ensino & Treinamento Expt Ciencias Saude Cetr,"Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil;Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Brazil;Ctr Ensino & Treinamento Expt Ciencias Saude Cetr, Brazil","Olijnyk, Jose Gustavo; Cavazzola, Leandro Totti; de Aguilar-Nascimento, Jose Eduardo; Nacul, Miguel Prestes; Couto e Almeida Filho, Elias",,

Materials and Methods: This is a quantitative, descriptive study of the universe of Latin American nursing journals (119) and scientific documents (13,208) published according to current library databases including: the Web of Science (WOS), Medline, LILACS, Periodica, Cuiden, and SciELO. A database was prepared using ProCite((R)). Results: The PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) Open-access Directory of Latin American Nursing Journals includes the greatest number of the 119 journal titles (60%). The average journal longevity is 11.3 years and Brazil produces the greatest percentage (31.9%) of journals. Of the current journals, 55% do not have international readership. The non-Latin American countries that contribute most to document diffusion are Spain, the United States, and England. The doubling time of scientific production of documents is 7.3 years and the annual growth rate is 10%; 2% of researchers form the most productive group of authors. Only in recent years has the number of contributions to the ISI nursing category begun to stabilize. Conclusions: Latin American scientific nursing production is still growing exponentially and Latin American nursing contributions to knowledge being disseminated through databases of recognized scientific quality seem to be increasing.

To fill this gap, this study visualizes green space accessibility for 4353 cities across the globe. Three global open datasets and two different scales (city- and national-scales) were involved for the analysis. We found that most countries and cities have a relative high value in terms of the green space accessibility, and those with a relatively low value are mostly located in South American, African, and Asian countries and cities.

First, the system is based on Spatial Data Infrastructure architecture and web interface built using free software and public domain data. Second, we went beyond visualization of maps and spatial queries by providing information obtained with spatial analysis models. To do that, we designed a database that stores the results of previously defined spatial analyses and developed customized reports and query tools to facilitate fast access of information by end-users. Finally, the system is application-oriented in the areas of forest monitoring, conservation and forest law enforcement, meaning that it aims to contribute to support the protection of Brazilian Amazon forests. We illustrate these principles by presenting ImazonGeo's technology, architecture, content and tools. Moreover, we present two successful cases to demonstrate how the system is being used.

Aim: This study aimed to create an image dataset of commonly consumed nut types and use it to build an AI computer vision model to automate nut type classification tasks. Methods: iPhone 11 was used to take photos of 11 nut types—almond, brazil nut, cashew, chestnut, hazelnut, macadamia, peanut, pecan, pine nut, pistachio, and walnut. The dataset contains 2200 images, 200 per nut type. The dataset was randomly split into the training (60% or 1320 images), validation (20% or 440 images), and test sets (20% or 440 images). A neural network model was constructed and trained using transfer learning and other computer vision techniques—data augmentation, mixup, normalization, label smoothing, and learning rate optimization. Results: The trained neural network model correctly predicted 338 out of 440 images (40 per nut type) in the validation set, achieving 99.55% accuracy. Moreover, the model classified the 440 images in the test set with 100% accuracy. Conclusion: This study built a nut image dataset and used it to train a neural network model to classify images by nut type. The model achieved near-perfect accuracy on the validation and test sets, demonstrating the feasibility of automating nut type classification using smartphone photos. Being made open-source, the dataset and model can assist the development of diet-tracking apps that facilitate users’ adoption and adherence to a healthy diet. © The Author(s) 2022.",We got nuts! use deep neural networks to classify images of common edible nuts,"An R., Perez-Cruet J., Wang J.",2022,Nutrition and Health,,,,,,,1,10.1177/02601060221113928,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135011797&doi=10.1177%2f02601060221113928&partnerID=40&md5=94f3f971265fc6b29c133eb9c217b7cc,"Brown School, Washington University, St Louis, MO, United States; School of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO, United States; Department of Kinesiology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China","An, R., Brown School, Washington University, St Louis, MO, United States; Perez-Cruet, J., School of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO, United States; Wang, J., Department of Kinesiology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China",,,,"Wang, J.; Department of Kinesiology, China; email: wangjunjie@dlut.edu.cn",,,,,,SAGE Publications Ltd,2601060,,,,English,Nutr.

The secondary objective is to identify stress management strategies for the work environment during the pandemic. This is an integrative review. Phase 1 consisted of searches of open access electronic databases (MEDLINE, SciELO, Bireme, and LILACS) for papers published in 2020 addressing mental health, work, and pandemics. Phase 2 consisted of selecting literature recommended by specialists in occupational psychiatry and positive psychology. These materials were read and critically analyzed. Forty references were included in the literature review. The articles reviewed were classified into the following categories: articles concerning work relationships in Brazil; articles describing the impact of pandemics on mental health and work; articles focusing on the work of health professionals during pandemics; articles about well-being at work; and papers proposing strategies to improve well-being and productivity and to promote mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic can have a significant impact on workers’ mental health and productivity. Most professionals face a need to adapt to changes, which can decrease their feeling of well-being. Consequently, strategies to promote well-being and mental health in the work environment should be a priority. Work routines were modified after the COVID-19 pandemic set in and assessing these changes is essential to maintain workers’ mental health. By so doing, it is possible to promote general well-being and post-traumatic recovery and reduce stress levels. © 2022, Sociedade de Psiquiatria do Rio Grande do Sul.

Understanding the most recent global patterns and temporal trends of cervical cancer burden might be helpful for its prevention and control. Methods Data on cervical cancer (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code C53) incidence and mortality in 2018 were extracted from the GLOBOCAN 2018 database and further analyzed for their correlations with the Human Development Index. Temporal trends were analyzed using the annual percent change with joinpoint analysis among 31 countries with highly qualified data from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Plus and World Health Organization mortality databases. Future trends for the next 15 years were predicted using an open-source age-period-cohort model. Results Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates were both negatively correlated with the Human Development Index (r = -0.56 for incidence, r = -0.69 for mortality; P < .001) in cross-sectional analysis, and both remained stable in 12 countries or even decreased in 14 and 18 countries for incidence and mortality, respectively, during the most recent 10 data years. Similar findings were observed for the next 15 years. Conclusions Cervical cancer burden was correlated with socioeconomic development. An overwhelming majority of countries had stable or decreasing trends in incidence and mortality rates, especially in those with effective cervical cancer screening programs and human papillomavirus vaccination. Lay Summary The authors investigated the most up-to-date data from official databases released by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and found that cervical cancer incidence and mortality were negatively correlated with socioeconomic development. Among the 31 countries analyzed, most (26 countries were analyzed for incidence, and 30 were analyzed for mortality) had stable or even decreasing temporal trends over the most recent 10 years, especially in those with effective cervical cancer screening programs. In addition, the predicted trends for the next 15 years were basically consistent with the observed trends among most of the analyzed countries (19 countries for incidence and 26 countries for mortality).","Worldwide trends in cervical cancer incidence and mortality, with predictions for the next 15 years","Lin, S.J., Gao, K., Gu, S.M., You, L.Q., Qian, S.N., Tang, M.L., Wang, J.B., Chen, K., Jin, M.J.",2021,CANCER,127,21,,4030,4039,10,31,10.1002/cncr.33795,,"[Lin, Shujuan; Gao, Kai; Gu, Simeng; You, Liuqing; Qian, Sangni; Tang, Mengling; Wang, Jianbing; Chen, Kun; Jin, Mingjuan] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Sch Med, Sch Publ Hlth, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jianbing] Zhejiang Univ, Natl Clin Res Ctr Child Hlth, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Kun; Jin, Mingjuan] Zhejiang Univ, Canc Inst, Affiliated Hosp 2, Sch Med, Hangzhou, Peoples R China",,cervical cancer; human development index; incidence; mortality; projection; temporal trend,HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; SCREENING-PROGRAMS; NORDIC COUNTRIES; LATIN-AMERICA; WOMEN; RISK; INFECTION; IMPACT; REGRESSION; TIME,cervical cancer;human development index;incidence;mortality;projection;temporal trend;HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION;SCREENING-PROGRAMS;NORDIC COUNTRIES;LATIN-AMERICA;WOMEN;RISK;INFECTION;IMPACT;REGRESSION;TIME,jinmj@zju.edu.cn,,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,WILEY,0008-543X,,,34368955,English,CANCER-AM CANCER SOC,Article,WoS,Oncology,WOS:000682879900001,,China,zju.edu.cn,Zhejiang Univ,"Zhejiang Univ, China","Lin, Shujuan; Gao, Kai; Gu, Simeng; You, Liuqing; Qian, Sangni; Tang, Mengling; Wang, Jianbing; Chen, Kun; Jin, Mingjuan",,
" performed a cross-sectional analysis of a publicly available data set. Data regarding the burden of prostate cancer in 20 Latin-American countries, and the 32 states of Mexico, were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019",Yes,"Purpose: Prostate cancer (PC) is the second leading cause of cancer and the fifth cause of cancer-related death. This manuscript aims to determine the incidence, mortality, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) trends of PC in the last 30 years in Latin America and Mexico.

Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a publicly available data set. Data regarding the burden of prostate cancer in 20 Latin-American countries, and the 32 states of Mexico, were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Collected information included incidence and mortality rates (per 100,000), as well as the DALYs as absolute numbers and rates (per 100,000) and the annual rates of change in rates from 1990 to 2019.

Results: In Latin America in males aged 55 years or older, the mean incidence rate was 344 cases per 100,000. The number of deaths attributable to prostate cancer observed was 67,110 and the mean mortality rate was 210 per 100,000. The overall burden of disease was 1,120,709 DALYs and the contribution of years of life lost (YLL) was 91.7% ([Formula: see text] = 1,027,946). Mexico presented an incidence rate (279.6) and mortality (99.1) rate (per /100 thousand). In Mexico, 13 states had a DALYs' rate above the national mean (883 per 100,000) and the highest burden (1360 DALYs/100,000) were documented in the state of Guerrero (Southwestern Mexico).

Conclusion: Only two Latin-American countries (Brazil and Colombia) and eight states of Mexico showed a decreased trend about the rate of change of DALYs in the last 30 years.","Regional and national burden of prostate cancer: incidence, mortality, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years, in Mexico and Latin America from 1990 to 2019","Guzman-Esquivel J, Murillo-Zamora E, Ortiz-Mesina M, Galvan-Salazar HR, De-Leon-Zaragoza L, Casarez-Price JC, Delgado-Enciso J, Delgado-Enciso I.",2023,Int Urol Nephrol,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11255-023-03653-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37273013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No mention of dataset,No,"Objective: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has high relapse rates due to dysregulated inflammatory signaling pathways and significant changes in the tumor microenvironment, probably influencing the failure of several therapies. The Cysteinyl Leukotriene Receptor 1 (CYSLTR1), a leukotriene modulator of inflammation, has been shown to play an important role in cancer pathogenesis and survival but few studies have been reported on its role in breast cancer.

Materials and methods: The present work was conducted using publicly available platforms that have omics data to assess the clinical potential of CYSLTR1 expression and its prognostic validation in large cohorts of samples from breast cancer patients. Web platforms containing clinical information, RNA-seq and protein data were selected to perform in silico analyses of the potential marker CYLSTR1. Added together, the platforms included modules for correlation, expression, prognosis, drug interactions, and construction of gene networks.

Results: Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that reduced levels of CYSLTR1 corresponded to an unfavorable outcome for overall survival (p<0.005) as well as relapse-free survival (p<0.001) in the basal subtype. Additionally, CYSLTR1 was downregulated in breast tumor samples compared to adjacent healthy tissue (p<0.01) and the basal subtype exhibited the lowest expression of CYSLTR1 relative to the other subtypes (p<0.0001). Furthermore, gene networking analysis showed strong associations of CYSLTR1 with two protein-coding genes (P2RY10 and XCR1) when tested on a TNBC dataset.

Conclusion: Our data highlighted the relevance of CYSLTR1 since it may play an important role in TNBC therapy. However, further in vitro and in vivo studies should be directed towards validating our findings in an effort to improve our understanding of TNBC pathology.",Altered Expression of CYSLTR1 is Associated With Adverse Clinical Outcome in Triple Negative Breast Tumors: An In Silico Approach,"Céspedes AG, Conceição MPF, de Bastos DR, de Grazia GÁ, Leite JMRS, do Nascimento RG, Ferreira MT, Lopez RM.",2023,Eur J Breast Health,,,,,,,,10.4274/ejbh.galenos.2023.2022-12-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37025579,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeast,No,"Metschnikowia pulcherrima is an important yeast species that is attracting increased interest thanks to its biotechnological potential, especially in agri-food applications. Phylogenetically related species of the so-called ‘pulcherrima clade’ were first described and then reclassified in one single species, which makes the identification an intriguing issue. Starting from the whole-genome sequencing of the protechnological strain Metschnikowia sp. DBT012, this study applied comparative genomics to calculate similarity with the M. pulcherrima clade publicly available genomes with the aim to verify if novel single-copy putative phylogenetic markers could be selected, in comparison with the commonly used primary and secondary barcodes. The genome-based bioinformatic analysis allowed the identification of 85 consensus single-copy orthologs, which were reduced to three after split decomposition analysis. However, wet-lab amplification of these three genes in nonsequenced type strains revealed the presence of multiple copies, which made them unsuitable as phylogenetic markers. Finally, average nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated between strain DBT012 and available genome sequences of the M. pulcherrima clade, although the genome dataset is still rather limited. Presence of multiple copies of phylogenetic markers as well as ANI values were compatible with the recent reclassification of the clade, allowing the identification of strain DBT012 as M. pulcherrima.",Finding a correct species assignment for a Metschnikowia strain: insights from the genome sequencing of strain DBT012,"Troiano E, Larini I, Binati RL, Gatto V, Torriani S, Buzzini P, Turchetti B, Salvetti E, Felis GE.",2023,FEMS Yeast Res,,,,,,,,10.1093/femsyr/foad024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37019825,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sheep,No,"Background: To enhance and extend the knowledge about the global historical and phylogenetic relationships between Merino and Merino-derived breeds, 19 populations were genotyped with the OvineSNP50 BeadChip specifically for this study, while an additional 23 populations from the publicly available genotypes were retrieved. Three complementary statistical tests, Rsb (extended haplotype homozygosity between-populations), XP-EHH (cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity), and runs of homozygosity (ROH) islands were applied to identify genomic variants with potential impact on the adaptability of Merino genetic type in two contrasting climate zones.

Results: The results indicate that a large part of the Merino's genetic relatedness and admixture patterns are explained by their genetic background and/or geographic origin, followed by local admixture. Multi-dimensional scaling, Neighbor-Net, Admixture, and TREEMIX analyses consistently provided evidence of the role of Australian, Rambouillet and German strains in the extensive gene introgression into the other Merino and Merino-derived breeds. The close relationship between Iberian Merinos and other South-western European breeds is consistent with the Iberian origin of the Merino genetic type, with traces from previous contributions of other Mediterranean stocks. Using Rsb and XP-EHH approaches, signatures of selection were detected spanning four genomic regions located on Ovis aries chromosomes (OAR) 1, 6 and 16, whereas two genomic regions on OAR6, that partially overlapped with the previous ones, were highlighted by ROH islands. Overall, the three approaches identified 106 candidate genes putatively under selection. Among them, genes related to immune response were identified via the gene interaction network. In addition, several candidate genes were found, such as LEKR1, LCORL, GHR, RBPJ, BMPR1B, PPARGC1A, and PRKAA1, related to morphological, growth and reproductive traits, adaptive thermogenesis, and hypoxia responses.

Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive dataset that includes most of the Merino and Merino-derived sheep breeds raised in different regions of the world. The results provide an in-depth picture of the genetic makeup of the current Merino and Merino-derived breeds, highlighting the possible selection pressures associated with the combined effect of anthropic and environmental factors.

"xplore the diversity of journal editorial boards publishing in environmental science and public health. The Clarivate Journal Citation Reports database was used to identify journals classified as Public, Environmental, and Occupational (PEO) Health, Environmental Studies, or Environmental Sciences - more scientometric",No,"In light of global environmental crises and the need for sustainable development, the fields of public health and environmental sciences have become increasingly interrelated. Both fields require interdisciplinary thinking and global solutions, which is largely directed by scientific progress documented in peer-reviewed journals. Journal editors play a critical role in coordinating and shaping what is accepted as scientific knowledge. Previous research has demonstrated a lack of diversity in the gender and geographic representation of editors across scientific disciplines. This study aimed to explore the diversity of journal editorial boards publishing in environmental science and public health. The Clarivate Journal Citation Reports database was used to identify journals classified as Public, Environmental, and Occupational (PEO) Health, Environmental Studies, or Environmental Sciences. Current EB members were identified from each journal's publicly available website between 1 March and 31 May 2021. Individuals' names, editorial board roles, institutional affiliations, geographic locations (city, country), and inferred gender were collected. Binomial 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the proportions of interest. Pearson correlations with false discovery rate adjustment were used to assess the correlation between journal-based indicators and editorial board characteristics. Linear regression and logistic regression models were fitted to further assess the relationship between gender presence, low- and middle-income country (LMIC) presence and several journal and editor-based indicators. After identifying 628 unique journals and excluding discontinued or unavailable journals, 615 journal editorial boards were included. In-depth analysis was conducted on 591 journals with complete gender and geographic data for their 27,772 editors. Overall, the majority of editors were men (65.9%), followed by women (32.9%) and non-binary/other gender minorities (0.05%). 75.5% journal editorial boards (n = 446) were composed of a majority of men (>55% men), whilst only 13.2% (n = 78) demonstrated gender parity (between 45-55% women/gender minorities). Journals categorized as PEO Health had the most gender diversity. Furthermore, 84% of editors (n = 23,280) were based in high-income countries and only 2.5% of journals (n = 15) demonstrated economic parity in their editorial boards (between 45-55% editors from LMICs). Geographically, the majority of editors' institutions were based in the United Nations (UN) Western Europe and Other region (76.9%), with 35.2% of editors (n = 9,761) coming solely from the United States and 8.6% (n = 2,373) solely from the United Kingdom. None of the editors-in-chief and only 27 editors in total were women based in low-income countries. Through the examination of journal editorial boards, this study exposes the glaring lack of diversity in editorial boards in environmental science and public health, explores the power dynamics affecting the creation and dissemination of knowledge, and proposes concrete actions to remedy these structural inequities in order to inform more equitable, just and impactful knowledge creation.","Challenging the ""old boys club"" in academia: Gender and geographic representation in editorial boards of journals publishing in environmental sciences and public health","Dada S, van Daalen KR, Barrios-Ruiz A, Wu KT, Desjardins A, Bryce-Alberti M, Castro-Varela A, Khorsand P, Santamarta Zamorano A, Jung L, Malolos G, Li J, Vervoort D, Hamilton NC, Patil P, El Omrani O, Wangari MC, Sibanda T, Buggy C, Mogo ERI.",2022,PLOS Glob Public Health,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pgph.0000541,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36962476,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

horse,No,"Introduction: The Italian peninsula is in the center of the Mediterranean area, and historically it has been a hub for numerous human populations, cultures, and also animal species that enriched the hosted biodiversity. Horses are no exception to this phenomenon, with the peculiarity that the gene pool has been impacted by warfare and subsequent ""colonization"". In this study, using a comprehensive dataset for almost the entire Italian equine population, in addition to the most influential cosmopolitan breeds, we describe the current status of the modern Italian gene pool. Materials and Methods: The Italian dataset comprised 1,308 individuals and 22 breeds genotyped at a 70 k density that was merged with publicly available data to facilitate comparison with the global equine diversity. After quality control and supervised subsampling to ensure consistency among breeds, the merged dataset with the global equine diversity contained data for 1,333 individuals from 54 populations. Multidimensional scaling, admixture, gene flow, and effective population size were analyzed. Results and Discussion: The results show that some of the native Italian breeds preserve distinct gene pools, potentially because of adaptation to the different geographical contexts of the peninsula. Nevertheless, the comparison with international breeds highlights the presence of strong gene flow from renowned breeds into several Italian breeds, probably due to historical introgression. Coldblood breeds with stronger genetic identity were indeed well differentiated from warmblood breeds, which are highly admixed.

 Brazilian national screening database (DATASUS/SISMAMA/Information System on Breast Cancer) was used as a data source and is publicly available for download and analysis,Yes,"Objective: This study aims to evaluate the impact of the Pink October Campaign on the increase in mammographic screening in Brazil.

Study design: Ecological observational study, based on retrospective data.

Methods: Brazilian national screening database (DATASUS/SISMAMA/Information System on Breast Cancer) was used as a data source and is publicly available for download and analysis. We report screening numbers and outcome rates from January 2017 to December 2021 comparing statistically (ANOVA test, post-Tukey test), age groups, regions of Brazil, and the four quarters of the year.

Results: During the study period, the average number of exams performed monthly over the five years was 137,400.117. An increase in the number of mammograms performed in October was identified, as well as in the two following months, respectively 33%, 39%, and 22%, with statistical significance (p = 0.000) in relation to the three quarters of the year. In addition, in the other months, we found values below the monthly average. Statistical difference was not found in the increase in mammograms considering age groups (p = 0.5) and different regions of the country (p = 0.6).

Conclusions: This study showed an increase in mammographic screening in the three months following the Pink October Campaign, so we should intensify similar actions throughout the year and not just in October.

Travel dataset,No,"Collecting GPS data using mobile devices is essential to understanding human mobility. However, getting this type of data is tricky because of some specific features of mobile operating systems, the high-power consumption of mobile devices, and users' privacy concerns. Therefore, data of this kind are rarely publicly available for scientific purposes, while private companies that own the data are often reluctant to share it. Here we present a large anonymous longitudinal dataset of Activity Point Location (APL) generated from mobile devices' GPS tracking. The GPS data were collected by using the Google Location History (GLH), accessible in the Google Maps application. Our dataset, named AnLoCOV hereafter, includes anonymised data from 338 persons with corresponding socio-demographics over approximately ten years (2012-2022), thus covering pre- and post-COVID periods, and calculates over 2 million weekly-classified APL extracted from approximately 16 million GPS tracking points in Ecuador.

Plant and leaf rust,No,"Leaf rust caused by Cerotelium fici (Cast.) Arth. is the main disease affecting Moraceae family plants, such as Ficus and Morus species (Galleti and Rezende 2016; Srikantaswamy et al. 2006). In August 2020, rust symptoms were observed in 100% of mulberry (Morus nigra L.) trees in an experimental orchard (Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; 22°42’28”S, 47°37’42”W). Mulberry leaves with high rust severity became yellowish and fell-off prematurely. Pustules were light brown with yellowish halo and presented mean size of 0.9 mm2. Uredinial paraphyses (n = 50) measured 42.2 ± 0.67 µm long with wall uniformly ca 0.6-1.1 μm thick. Urediniospores were brownish, echinulate, globoid to broadly ellipsoid, and measured 27.1 ± 0.29 × 21.0 ± 0.27 µm with a wall thickness of 0.6 ± 0.01 µm (n = 100). The morphology of the urediniospores observed in this study was similar to that reported in the literature for C. fici on Morus alba and Ficus spp. (Gupta et al. 1994; McKenzie 1986; Hennen et al. 2005). We used a low-coverage genome-skimming approach to retrieve genetic information of the rRNA cluster and the mtDNA. Genomic DNA was extracted from 3-4 mg of stored urediniospores at -80 °C, macerated in liquid nitrogen, using a modified cetyl trimethylammonium bromide extraction procedure (Lo Piccolo et al. 2012), and sequenced with 150-bp paired-end reads on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 System. Raw data, (45,761,957 X 2 reads) were assembled with SPAdes v3.15.1 (Bankevich et al., 2012) and the output used to create a custom BLAST database. Loci used for the phylogenetic analyses were identified by BLASTn using, as a query, sequences of C. fici from Ficus sp. from Australia publicly available: Accession No. MH047210.1 for the rRNA and MW036502.1 for COX3. The retrieved sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers OM296992 and OP797407 for the partial rRNA cluster and COX3, respectively. The Bayesian inference phylogenetic analysis of the three concatenate loci (18S, 28S, and COX3) revealed that the isolate obtained in this study (MN1) was clustered in a well-supported clade with C. fici type species. Pathogenicity tests were conducted using mulberry potted plants under greenhouse conditions (25 ± 5 °C). The urediniospores suspension (5 × 104 urediniospores ml-1) with 0.05% Tween 20 was sprayed with an airbrush on fully expanded leaves until run-off. As a control, mulberry plants were sprayed with distilled water and kept under the same conditions. Inoculated and mock-inoculated plants were kept in a dark moist chamber at 23 °C (± 2 °C) for 24 h. After this period, plants were moved to the greenhouse. The experimental design was completely randomized with five replicates, each replicate consisted of one potted plant and the experiment was performed twice. At 12 days post-inoculation, all inoculated plants showed rust symptoms identical to those observed in the field, whereas control plants had no symptoms. The first symptoms were small pustules on the abaxial surface of fully expanded leaves. Small chlorotic lesions were observed on the adaxial leaf surface, which evolved into necrotic lesions. The pathogen was re-inoculated into potted plants, where it was maintained through monthly inoculations. To our knowledge, this is the first report of mulberry rust on M. nigra in Brazil. As mulberry leaves are the only natural food for silkworm (Bombyx mori L.), rust poses a significant threat to the sericulture industry because the disease can decrease production and quality of mulberry foliage.",First Report of Mulberry Rust Caused by Cerotelium fici on Morus nigra in Brazil,"Gonçalves MP, Simões ALT, Boufleur TR, Santos RFD, Baroncelli R, Amorim L.",2022,Plant Dis,,,,,,,,10.1094/PDIS-11-22-2656-PDN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36410015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he models are trained and tested on aggregated, publicly available data sets with over 10 categories. To further assess the models, a data set was collected from multiple medical institutions in Colombia, which includes healthy, COVID-19 and patients with other diseases. - deep neural network employed",No,"Purpose: Determination and development of an effective set of models leveraging Artificial Intelligence techniques to generate a system able to support clinical practitioners working with COVID-19 patients. It involves a pipeline including classification, lung and lesion segmentation, as well as lesion quantification of axial lung CT studies.

Approach: A deep neural network architecture based on DenseNet is introduced for the classification of weakly-labeled, variable-sized (and possibly sparse) axial lung CT scans. The models are trained and tested on aggregated, publicly available data sets with over 10 categories. To further assess the models, a data set was collected from multiple medical institutions in Colombia, which includes healthy, COVID-19 and patients with other diseases. It is composed of 1,322 CT studies from a diverse set of CT machines and institutions that make over 550,000 slices. Each CT study was labeled based on a clinical test, and no per-slice annotation took place. This enabled a classification into Normal vs. Abnormal patients, and for those that were considered abnormal, an extra classification step into Abnormal (other diseases) vs. COVID-19. Additionally, the pipeline features a methodology to segment and quantify lesions of COVID-19 patients on the complete CT study, enabling easier localization and progress tracking. Moreover, multiple ablation studies were performed to appropriately assess the elements composing the classification pipeline.

Results: The best performing lung CT study classification models achieved 0.83 accuracy, 0.79 sensitivity, 0.87 specificity, 0.82 F1 score and 0.85 precision for the Normal vs. Abnormal task. For the Abnormal vs COVID-19 task, the model obtained 0.86 accuracy, 0.81 sensitivity, 0.91 specificity, 0.84 F1 score and 0.88 precision. The ablation studies showed that using the complete CT study in the pipeline resulted in greater classification performance, restating that relevant COVID-19 patterns cannot be ignored towards the top and bottom of the lung volume.

Discussion: The lung CT classification architecture introduced has shown that it can handle weakly-labeled, variable-sized and possibly sparse axial lung studies, reducing the need for expert annotations at a per-slice level.

Review of databases,No,"The landscape of glioma research has evolved in the past 20 years to include numerous large, multi-institutional, database efforts compiling either clinical data on glioma patients, molecular data on glioma specimens, or a combination of both. While these strategies can provide a wealth of information for glioma research, obtaining information regarding data availability and access specifications can be challenging.

Methods
We reviewed the literature for ongoing clinical, molecular, and combined database efforts related to glioma research to provide researchers with a curated overview of the current state of glioma database resources.

Results
We identified and reviewed a total of 20 databases with data collection spanning from 1975 to 2022. Surveyed databases included both low- and high-grade gliomas, and data elements included over 100 clinical variables and 12 molecular data types. Select database strengths included large sample sizes and a wide variety of variables available, while limitations of some databases included complex data access requirements and a lack of glioma-specific variables.

Conclusions
This review highlights current databases and registries and their potential utility in clinical and genomic glioma research. While many high-quality resources exist, the fluid nature of glioma taxonomy makes it difficult to isolate a large cohort of patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis.

Foreign trade data regarding tobacco,No,"Background: Paraguay is a major supplier of illicit cigarettes for the Latin American region and beyond. In July 2022, Paraguay ratified the FCTC Protocol. This is an opportunity and a challenge for neighboring countries to implement coordinated actions. This is the first analysis of the foreign trade data for cigarettes and their inputs using Paraguayan data to contextualise the illicit trade problem in Latin America and globally.

Methods: Combining publicly available Paraguayan databases, this research constructs a database to analyse imported cigarette inputs, particularly by identifying the companies and their national origins.

Results: A complex multinational supply chain perpetuates a flow of inputs into Paraguay that contributes to the production and export of illicit tobacco products. Brazil is a relevant legal supplier of intermediate goods for the Paraguayan tobacco industry yet is not a significant destination of the legal exports of cigarettes produced in Paraguay. Yet, Paraguayan cigarettes are widely available in the Brazilian market, almost all of them illicit. Trade data also show the role of other countries in the region as major cigarette input exporters to Paraguay. Evidence also supports that high volumes of legal exports from Paraguay to third countries (including Bolivia, Suriname, Aruba and Curacao) may be fuelling illicit trade through triangulation to other countries.

Conclusions: The oversupply-that is, more supply than necessary for domestic consumption and legal exports-of cigarette inputs likely divert illegally back to the countries exporting these inputs and others. Thus, the responsibility for illicit trade in cigarettes falls not only on Paraguayan companies but also on companies exporting inputs to Paraguay to producing these illicit goods. Furthermore, Paraguay is not only exporting illicitly directly to Brazil and Argentina, but also appears to oversupply other countries in South America and the Caribbean that cannot legally absorb this trade through domestic consumption and/or legal re-export.",Regional implications of the tobacco value chain in Paraguay,"Masi F, Rodriguez-Iglesias G, Drope J.",2022,Tob Control,,,,,,,,10.1136/tc-2021-056891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36002166,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We geocoded human leptospirosis cases derived from the Argentinian surveillance system during the period 2010 to 2019. Environmental and socioeconomic databases were obtained from satellite images and publicly available platforms on the web.,Yes,"Background: Leptospirosis is among the leading zoonotic causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Knowledge about spatial patterns of diseases and their underlying processes have the potential to guide intervention efforts. However, leptospirosis is often an underreported and misdiagnosed disease and consequently, spatial patterns of the disease remain unclear. In the absence of accurate epidemiological data in the urban agglomeration of Santa Fe, we used a knowledge-based index and cluster analysis to identify spatial patterns of environmental and socioeconomic suitability for the disease and potential underlying processes that shape them.

Methods: We geocoded human leptospirosis cases derived from the Argentinian surveillance system during the period 2010 to 2019. Environmental and socioeconomic databases were obtained from satellite images and publicly available platforms on the web. Two sets of human leptospirosis determinants were considered according to the level of their support by the literature and expert knowledge. We used the Zonation algorithm to build a knowledge-based index and a clustering approach to identify distinct potential sets of determinants. Spatial similarity and correlations between index, clusters, and incidence rates were evaluated.

Results: We were able to geocode 56.36% of the human leptospirosis cases reported in the national epidemiological database. The knowledge-based index showed the suitability for human leptospirosis in the UA Santa Fe increased from downtown areas of the largest cities towards peri-urban and suburban areas. Cluster analysis revealed downtown areas were characterized by higher levels of socioeconomic conditions. Peri-urban and suburban areas encompassed two clusters which differed in terms of environmental determinants. The highest incidence rates overlapped areas with the highest suitability scores, the strength of association was low though (CSc r = 0.21, P < 0.001 and ESc r = 0.19, P < 0.001).

Conclusions: We present a method to analyze the environmental and socioeconomic suitability for human leptospirosis based on literature and expert knowledge. The methodology can be thought as an evolutive and perfectible scheme as more studies are performed in the area and novel information regarding determinants of the disease become available. Our approach can be a valuable tool for decision-makers since it can serve as a baseline to plan intervention measures.",Determining the spatial distribution of environmental and socio-economic suitability for human leptospirosis in the face of limited epidemiological data,"Cristaldi MA, Catry T, Pottier A, Herbreteau V, Roux E, Jacob P, Previtali MA.",2022,Infect Dis Poverty,,,,,,,,10.1186/s40249-022-01010-x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35927739,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deforestation dataset,No,"Studying land use change in protected areas (PAs) located in tropical forests is a major conservation priority due to high conservation value (e.g., species richness and carbon storage) here, coupled with generally high deforestation rates. Land use change researchers use a variety of land cover products to track deforestation trends, including maps they produce themselves and readily available products, such as the Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset. However, all land cover maps should be critically assessed for limitations and biases to accurately communicate and interpret results. In this study, we assess deforestation in PA complexes located in agricultural frontiers in the Amazon Basin. We studied three specific sites: Amboró and Carrasco National Parks in Bolivia, Jamanxim National Forest in Brazil, and Tambopata National Reserve and Bahuaja-Sonene National Park in Peru. Within and in 20km buffer areas around each complex, we generated land cover maps using composites of Landsat imagery and supervised classification, and compared deforestation trends to data from the GFC dataset. We then performed a dissimilarity analysis to explore the discrepancies between the two remote sensing products. Both the GFC and our supervised classification showed that deforestation rates were higher in the 20km buffer than inside the PAs and that Jamanxim National Forest had the highest deforestation rate of the PAs we studied. However, GFC maps showed consistently higher rates of deforestation than our maps. Through a dissimilarity analysis, we found that many of the inconsistencies between these datasets arise from different treatment of mixed pixels or different parameters in map creation (for example, GFC does not detect reforestation after 2012). We found that our maps underestimated deforestation while GFC overestimated deforestation, and that true deforestation rates likely fall between our two estimates. We encourage users to consider limitations and biases when using or interpreting our maps, which we make publicly available, and GFC’s maps.",Biases and limitations of Global Forest Change and author-generated land cover maps in detecting deforestation in the Amazon,"Kinnebrew E, Ochoa-Brito JI, French M, Mills-Novoa M, Shoffner E, Siegel K.",2022,PLoS One,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0268970,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35793333,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Governance and deforestation,No,"Deforestation continues at rapid rates despite global conservation efforts. Evidence suggests that governance may play a critical role in influencing deforestation, and while a number of studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between national-level governance and deforestation, much remains to be known about the relative importance of subnational governance to deforestation outcomes. With a focus on the Brazilian Amazon, this study aims to understand the relationship between governance and deforestation at the municipal level. Drawing on the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) as a guiding conceptual framework, and incorporating the additional dimension of environmental governance, we identified a wide array of publicly available data sources related to governance indicators that we used to select relevant governance variables. We compiled a dataset of 22 municipal-level governance variables covering the 2005-2018 period for 457 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon. Using an econometric approach, we tested the relationship between governance variables and deforestation rates in a fixed-effects panel regression analysis. We found that municipalities with increasing numbers of agricultural companies tended to have higher rates of deforestation, municipalities with an environmental fund tended to have lower rates of deforestation, and municipalities that had previously elected a female mayor tended to have lower rates of deforestation. These results add to the wider conversation on the role of local-level governance, revealing that certain governance variables may contribute to halting deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.",What's governance got to do with it?

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and principal component analysis (PCA) remain well-established techniques despite their different theoretical perspectives. Network analysis (NA) has recently gained popularity together with such algorithms as the Next Eigenvalue Sufficiency Test. These analyses link statistics and psychology, but their results tend to vary, leading to an open methodological debate on statistical assumptions of psychometric analyses and the extent to which results that are generated with these analyses align with the theoretical basis that underlies an instrument. The current study uses a previously published data set from the Ages & Stages Questionnaires: Social-Emotional to explore, show, and discuss several exploratory analyses of its internal structure. To a lesser degree, this study furthers the ongoing debate on the interface between theoretical and methodological perspectives in psychometrics. Methods From a sample of 22,331 sixty-month-old children, 500 participants were randomly selected. Pearson and polychoric correlation matrices were compared and used as inputs in the psychometric analyses. The number of factors was determined via well-known rules of thumb, including the parallel analysis and the Hull method. Multidimensional solutions were rotated via oblique methods. R and Factor software were used, the codes for which are publicly available at https://luisfca.shinyapps.io/psychometrics_asq_se/ . Results Solutions from one to eight dimensions were suggested. Polychoric correlation overcame Pearson correlation, but nonconvergence issues were detected. The Hull method achieved a unidimensional structure. PCA and EFA achieved similar results. Conversely, six clusters were suggested via NA. Conclusion The statistical outcomes for determining the factor structure of an assessment diverged, varying from one to eight domains, which allowed for different interpretations of the results.

The release of the Norway's International Climate & Forests Initiative (NICFI) Planet tropical basemaps time-series starting in 2015 at a 4.77-m resolution represents a unique opportunity to forecast climate change consequences such as drought episodes. Using multi-temporal ground surveys over 144 plots and publicly available high-resolution Planet dove time-series imagery we evaluate forest mortality patterns driven by imaging spectroscopy methods in Mato Grosso (Brazil) over an area planted with eucalypts severely affected by the 2019 drought. Changes in vegetation indexes before and after the 2019 drought were modelled using the effective logistic regression modelling to explain variation in tree mortality between the surveys, the dependent variable. We aimed to straightforwardly model tree mortality using change vectors in Planet's image mosaics co-registering in time with the observed tree mortality measurements in the field.

Information about the genetic influence on various diseases, including autism, in the Amerindian population from Amazon, is still scarce. We investigated 35 variants of the CHD8, SCN2A, FOXP1, and SYNGAP1 gene in Amazonian Amerindians in comparison with publicly available population frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project database. Our study identified 16 variants in the Amerindian population of the Amazon with frequencies significantly different from the other populations. Among them, the SCN2A (rs17183814, rs75109281, and rs150453735), FOXP1 (rs56850311 and rs939845), and SYNGAP1 (rs9394145 and rs115441992) variants presented higher frequency than all other populations analyzed. In addition, nine variants were found with lower frequency among the Amerindians: CHD8 (rs35057134 and rs10467770), SCN2A (rs3769951, rs2304014, rs1838846, and rs7593568), FOXP1 (rs112773801 and rs56850311), and SYNGAP1 (rs453590). These data show the unique genetic profile of the indigenous population of the Brazilian Amazon.

DNA barcoding of Colombian fish,No,"Background: The Barcode of Life initiative was originally motivated by the large number of species, taxonomic difficulties and the limited number of expert taxonomists. Colombia has 1,610 freshwater fish species and comprises the second largest diversity of this group in the world. As genetic information continues to be limited, we constructed a reference collection of DNA sequences of Colombian freshwater fishes deposited in the Ichthyology Collection of the University of Antioquia (CIUA), thus joining the multiple efforts that have been made in the country to contribute to the knowledge of genetic diversity in order to strengthen the inventories of biological collections and facilitate the solution of taxonomic issues in the future.

New information: This study contributes to the knowledge on the DNA barcodes and occurrence records of 96 species of Colombian freshwater fishes. Fifty-seven of the species represented in this dataset were already available in the Barcode Of Life Data System (BOLD System), while 39 correspond to new species to the BOLD System. Forty-nine specimens were collected in the Atrato River Basin and 708 in the Magdalena-Cauca asin during the period 2010-2020. Two species (Loricariichthysbrunneus (Hancock, 1828) and Poeciliasphenops Valenciennes, 1846) are considered exotic to the Atrato, Cauca and Magdalena Basins and four species (Oncorhynchusmykiss (Walbaum, 1792), Oreochromisniloticus (Linnaeus, 1758), Parachromisfriedrichsthalii (Heckel, 1840) and Xiphophorushelleri Heckel, 1848) are exotic to the Colombian hydrogeographic regions. All specimens are deposited in CIUA and have their DNA barcodes made publicly available in the BOLD online database.

systematic review,No,"Background: Convalescent plasma has been widely used to treat COVID-19 and is under investigation in numerous randomized clinical trials, but results are publicly available only for a small number of trials. The objective of this study was to assess the benefits of convalescent plasma treatment compared to placebo or no treatment and all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19, using data from all available randomized clinical trials, including unpublished and ongoing trials (Open Science Framework, https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/GEHFX ).

Methods: In this collaborative systematic review and meta-analysis, clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), the Cochrane COVID-19 register, the LOVE database, and PubMed were searched until April 8, 2021. Investigators of trials registered by March 1, 2021, without published results were contacted via email. Eligible were ongoing, discontinued and completed randomized clinical trials that compared convalescent plasma with placebo or no treatment in COVID-19 patients, regardless of setting or treatment schedule. Aggregated mortality data were extracted from publications or provided by investigators of unpublished trials and combined using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman random effects model. We investigated the contribution of unpublished trials to the overall evidence.

Results: A total of 16,477 patients were included in 33 trials (20 unpublished with 3190 patients, 13 published with 13,287 patients). 32 trials enrolled only hospitalized patients (including 3 with only intensive care unit patients). Risk of bias was low for 29/33 trials. Of 8495 patients who received convalescent plasma, 1997 died (23%), and of 7982 control patients, 1952 died (24%). The combined risk ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.92; 1.02) with between-study heterogeneity not beyond chance (I2 = 0%). The RECOVERY trial had 69.8% and the unpublished evidence 25.3% of the weight in the meta-analysis.

Conclusions: Convalescent plasma treatment of patients with COVID-19 did not reduce all-cause mortality. These results provide strong evidence that convalescent plasma treatment for patients with COVID-19 should not be used outside of randomized trials. Evidence synthesis from collaborations among trial investigators can inform both evidence generation and evidence application in patient care.",Association between convalescent plasma treatment and mortality in COVID-19: a collaborative systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials,"Axfors C, Janiaud P, Schmitt AM, Van't Hooft J, Smith ER, Haber NA, Abayomi A, Abduljalil M, Abdulrahman A, Acosta-Ampudia Y, Aguilar-Guisado M, Al-Beidh F, Alejandria MM, Alfonso RN, Ali M, AlQahtani M, AlZamrooni A, Anaya JM, Ang MAC, Aomar IF, Argumanis LE, Averyanov A, Baklaushev VP, Balionis O, Benfield T, Berry S, Birocco N, Bonifacio LB, Bowen AC, Bown A, Cabello-Gutierrez C, Camacho B, Camacho-Ortiz A, Campbell-Lee S, Cao DH, Cardesa A, Carnate JM, Castillo GJJ, Cavallo R, Chowdhury FR, Chowdhury FUH, Ciccone G, Cingolani A, Climacosa FMM, Compernolle V, Cortez CFN, Costa Neto A, D'Antico S, Daly J, Danielle F, Davis JS, De Rosa FG, Denholm JT, Denkinger CM, Desmecht D, Díaz-Coronado JC, Díaz Ponce-Medrano JA, Donneau AF, Dumagay TE, Dunachie S, Dungog CC, Erinoso O, Escasa IMS, Estcourt LJ, Evans A, Evasan ALM, Fareli CJ, Fernandez-Sanchez V, Galassi C, Gallo JE, Garcia PJ, Garcia PL, Garcia JA, Garigliany M, Garza-Gonzalez E, Gauiran DTV, Gaviria García PA, Giron-Gonzalez JA, Gómez-Almaguer D, Gordon AC, Gothot A, Grass Guaqueta JS, Green C, Grimaldi D, Hammond NE, Harvala H, Heralde FM, Herrick J, Higgins AM, Hills TE, Hines J, Holm K, Hoque A, Hoste E, Ignacio JM, Ivanov AV, Janssen M, Jennings JH, Jha V, King RAN, et al.",2021,BMC Infect Dis,,,,,,,,10.1186/s12879-021-06829-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34800996,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Database on South American language,No,"The last two decades witnessed a rapid growth of publicly accessible online language resources. This has allowed for valuable data on lesser known languages to become available. Such resources provide linguists with opportunities for advancing their research. Yet despite the proliferation of lexical and morphological databases, the ca. 456 languages spoken in South America are poorly represented, particularly the Tupían family, which is the largest on the continent. This paper therefore introduces and discusses TuLeD, a lexical database exclusively devoted to a South American language family. It provides a comprehensive list of lexical items presented in a unified transcription for all languages with cognacy assignment and relevant (cultural or linguistic) notes. One of the main goals of TuLeD is to become a full-fledged database and a benchmark for linguistic studies on South American languages in general and the Tupían family in particular.",TuLeD (Tupían lexical database): introducing a database of a South American language family,"Gerardi FF, Reichert S, Aragon CC.",2021,Lang Resour Eval,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10579-020-09521-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34720783,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plant virus diagnostics,No,"High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies and bioinformatic analyses are of growing interest to be used as a routine diagnostic tool in the field of plant viruses. The reliability of HTS workflows from sample preparation to data analysis and results interpretation for plant virus detection and identification must be evaluated (verified and validated) to approve this tool for diagnostics. Many different extraction methods, library preparation protocols, and sequence and bioinformatic pipelines are available for virus sequence detection. To assess the performance of plant virology diagnostic laboratories in using the HTS of ribosomal RNA depleted total RNA (ribodepleted totRNA) as a diagnostic tool, we carried out an interlaboratory comparison study in which eight participants were required to use the same samples, (RNA) extraction kit, ribosomal RNA depletion kit, and commercial sequencing provider, but also their own bioinformatics pipeline, for analysis. The accuracy of virus detection ranged from 65% to 100%. The false-positive detection rate was very low and was related to the misinterpretation of results as well as to possible cross-contaminations in the lab or sequencing provider. The bioinformatic pipeline used by each laboratory influenced the correct detection of the viruses of this study. The main difficulty was the detection of a novel virus as its sequence was not available in a publicly accessible database at the time. The raw data were reanalysed using Virtool to assess its ability for virus detection. All virus sequences were detected using Virtool in the different pools. This study revealed that the ribodepletion target enrichment for sample preparation is a reliable approach for the detection of plant viruses with different genomes. A significant level of virology expertise is needed to correctly interpret the results. It is also important to improve and complete the reference data.",Interlaboratory Comparison Study on Ribodepleted Total RNA High-Throughput Sequencing for Plant Virus Diagnostics and Bioinformatic Competence,"Gaafar YZA, Westenberg M, Botermans M, László K, De Jonghe K, Foucart Y, Ferretti L, Kutnjak D, Pecman A, Mehle N, Kreuze J, Muller G, Vakirlis N, Beris D, Varveri C, Ziebell H.",2021,Pathogens,,,,,,,,10.3390/pathogens10091174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34578206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
moth database,No,"Background: Molecular DNA sequence data allow unprecedented advances in biodiversity assessments, monitoring schemes and taxonomic works, particularly in poorly-explored areas. They allow, for instance, the sorting of material rapidly into operational taxonomic units (such as BINs - Barcode Index Numbers), sequences can be subject to diverse analyses and, with linked metadata and physical vouchers, they can be examined further by experts. However, a prerequisite for their exploitation is the construction of reference libraries of DNA sequences that represent the existing biodiversity. To achieve these goals for Geometridae (Lepidoptera) moths in Colombia, expeditions were carried out to 26 localities in the northern part of the country in 2015-2019. The aim was to collect specimens and sequence their DNA barcodes and to record a fraction of the species richness and occurrences in one of the most biodiversity-rich countries. These data are the beginning of an identification guide to Colombian geometrid moths, whose identities are currently often provisional only, being morpho species or operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Prior to the current dataset, 99 Geometridae sequences forming 44 BINs from Colombia were publicly available on the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD), covering 20 species only.

New information: We enrich the Colombian Geometridae database significantly by including DNA barcodes, two nuclear markers, photos of vouchers and georeferenced occurrences of 281 specimens of geometrid moths from different localities. These specimens are classified into 80 genera. Analytical tools on BOLD clustered 157 of the mentioned sequences to existing BINs identified to species level, identified earlier by experts. Another 115 were assigned to BINs that were identified to genus or tribe level only. Eleven specimens did not match any existing BIN on BOLD and are, therefore, new additions to the database. It is likely that many BINs represent undescribed species. Nine short sequences (< 500bp) were not assigned to BINs, but identified to the lowest taxonomic category by expert taxonomists and with comparisons of type material photos. The released new genetic information will help to further progress the systematics of Geometridae. An illustrated catalogue of all new records allows validation of our identifications; it is also the first document of this kind for Colombian Geometridae. All specimens are deposited at the Museo de Zoología of Universidad de Sucre (MZUS), North Colombia.

Identificaiton of natural products,No,"The role and importance of the identification of natural products are discussed in the perspective of the study of secondary metabolites. The rapid identification of already reported compounds, or structural dereplication, is recognized as a key element in natural product chemistry. The biological taxonomy of metabolite producing organisms, the knowledge of metabolite molecular structures, and the availability of metabolite spectroscopic signatures are considered as the three pillars of structural dereplication. The role and the construction of databases is illustrated by references to the KNApSAcK, UNPD, CSEARCH, and COCONUT databases, and by the importance of calculated taxonomic and spectroscopic data as substitutes for missing or lost original ones. Two NMR-based tools, the PNMRNP database that derives from UNPD, and KnapsackSearch, a database generator that provides taxonomically focused libraries of compounds, are proposed to the community of natural product chemists.

" Furthermore, miRNA expression was validated in a separate, publicly available external dataset (n=19 typical lung carcinoids; 2/19 were metastatic tumors, compared to six normal lung tissues, GSE77380)",No,"Background/aims: Lung carcinoids are uncommon neuroendocrine tumours. Molecular features of lung carcinoids have been poorly defined. microRNAs (miRNAs) are potent gene expression regulators with important roles in cancer development and progression. However, little is known on the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of lung carcinoids. Our goals were to identify commonly deregulated miRNAs in a rare case of lung carcinoid of typical histology with metastasis, as well as map miRNA target genes in pathways potentially associated with disease development and progression.

Methods: miRNA expression profiles were assessed using the TaqMan Low Density Arrays, which is a platform including 384 miRNAs. miRNA profiles were generated in the tumor and its corresponding lymph node metastasis, compared to reference normal lung tissues. Furthermore, miRNA expression was validated in a separate, publicly available external dataset (n=19 typical lung carcinoids; 2/19 were metastatic tumors, compared to six normal lung tissues, GSE77380). Following this analysis, computational tools were applied for data interpretation. miRTarBase was used to determine miRNA-target genes, followed by ToppGene Suite analysis to identify pathways and biological functions. In addition, the expression of genes targeted by miRNAs was validated in a second, separate external dataset (n=13 tumour samples, GSE35679). GEO2R data analysis tool was used in both validation analyses (miRNAs and genes).

Results: We identified 15 commonly significantly downregulated miRNAs (fold change, FC≥2 and p<0.05) in the tumour and its paired metastasis, with further decreasing levels in the metastatic lesion. Downregulation of miR-126-3p and miR-146b-5p was validated in the external dataset GSE77380. In addition, SOX2 and TCF4 genes, targeted by miR-126-3p, were consistently overexpressed in a subset of six typical lung carcinoids from the external dataset GSE35679. Pathways analysis showed that miRNAs miR-126-3p and miR-146b-5p target genes with a role in the regulation of adaptive immune response.

Conclusion: Our results contribute to the identification of miRNA expression changes in a typical lung carcinoid and its corresponding lymph node metastasis. Down-regulated levels of miR-126-3p and miR-146b-5p and target gene over-expression could play a role in the progression of this case of primary typical lung carcinoid to regional metastasis.

DNA barcoding repositories for Southeast Pacific marine wildlife ,No,"The Southeast Pacific comprises two Large Marine Ecosystems, the Pacific Central-American Coastal and the Humboldt Current System; and is one of the less well known in the tropical subregions in terms of biodiversity. To address this, we compared DNA barcoding repositories with the marine biodiversity species for the Southeast Pacific.

Of the 5504 species records retrieved from OBIS, 42% of them had at least one registered specimen in BOLD (including specimens around the world); however, only 4.5% of records corresponded to publicly available DNA barcodes including specimens collected from a Southeast Pacific country. The low representation of barcoded species does not vary much across the different taxonomic groups or within countries, but we observed an asymmetric distribution of DNA barcoding records for taxonomic groups along the coast, being more abundant for the Humboldt Current System than the Pacific Central-American Coastal. We observed high-level of barcode records with Barcode Index Number (BIN) incongruences, particularly for fishes (Actinopterygii = 30.27% and Elasmobranchii = 24.71%), reflecting taxonomic uncertainties for fishes, whereas for Invertebrates and Mammalia more than 85% of records were classified as data deficient or inadequate procedure for DNA barcoding.

,No,"Leishmania braziliensis infection frequently results in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). An increase in incidence of drug-resistant CL leading to treatment failure has been reported. Identification of reliable predictors of treatment outcomes is necessary to optimize patient care. Here, we performed a prospective case-control study in which plasma levels of cytokines and lipid mediators were assessed at different time points during antileishmanial therapy in patients with CL from Brazil. Multidimensional analyses were employed to describe a combination of biomarkers able to predict and characterize treatment failure. We found a biosignature influenced mainly by plasma levels of lipid mediators that accurately predicted treatment failure. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of a publicly available data set revealed that expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism measured in skin lesions could distinguish treatment outcomes in CL. Thus, activation of pathways linked to lipid biosynthesis predicts treatment failure in CL. The biomarkers identified may be further explored as therapeutic targets.","Multi-omic Analyses of Plasma Cytokines, Lipidomics, and Transcriptomics Distinguish Treatment Outcomes in Cutaneous Leishmaniasis","Malta-Santos H, Fukutani KF, Sorgi CA, Queiroz ATL, Nardini V, Silva J, Lago A, Carvalho LP, Machado PLR, Bozza PT, França-Costa J, Faccioli LH, Carvalho EM, Andrade BB, Borges VM.",2020,iScience,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.isci.2020.101840,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33313489,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dataset for the tropical agriculture field,No,"Remote sensing allows obtaining information on agriculture regularly with non-invasive measurement approaches. Field data is crucial for adequate agricultural monitoring by remote sensing. However, public available field data are scarce, mainly in tropical regions, where agriculture is highly dynamic. The present publication aims to support the reduction of this gap. The LEM+ dataset provides information monthly about 16 land use classes for 1854 fields from October 2019 to September 2020 (one Brazilian agricultural year) from Luís Eduardo Magalhães (LEM) and other municipalities in the west of Bahia state, Brazil. The reference data were collected in two fieldworks (March 2020 – first crop season, and August 2020 – second crop season). The boundaries of the fields visited in situ were delimited using Sentinel-2 false color compositions (near infrared - red - green) at 10 m spatial resolution. The land use classes were labeled monthly based on information collected in situ (agricultural land use and photographs) and by visual interpretation of Sentinel-2 false color composition (near infrared - shortwave infrared - red) and MODIS/Terra (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series. The dataset can be useful for the development of new pattern recognition methods for agricultural land use mapping and monitoring, comparison of different classification methods, and optical and SAR remote sensing time series analysis.

Survey dataset about travel disruptions,No,"COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted the global community. To curb the viral transmission, travel restrictions have been enforced across the world. The dataset documents the mobility disruptions and the modal shifts that have occurred as a consequence of the restrictive measures implemented in ten countries: Australia, Brazil, China, Ghana, India, Iran, Italy, Norway, South Africa and the United States. An online questionnaire was distributed during the period from the 11st to the 31st of May 2020, with a total of 9 394 respondents. The first part of the survey has characterized the frequency of use of all transport modes before and during the enforcement of the restrictions, while the second part of the survey has dealt with perceived risks of contracting COVID-19 from different transport modes and perceived effectiveness of travel mitigation measures. Overall, the dataset (stored in a repository publicly available) can be conveniently used to quantify and understand the modal shifts and people's cognitive behavior towards travel due to COVID-19.

"The proposed model was trained and evaluated by using a publicly available data set from Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil, which consisted of 5644 data samples with 559 confirmed COVID-19 cases",Yes,"Background and objectives: The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely impacted human society with a massive death toll worldwide. There is an urgent need for early and reliable screening of COVID-19 patients to provide better and timely patient care and to combat the spread of the disease. In this context, recent studies have reported some key advantages of using routine blood tests for initial screening of COVID-19 patients. In this article, first we present a review of the emerging techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis using routine laboratory and/or clinical data. Then, we propose ERLX which is an ensemble learning model for COVID-19 diagnosis from routine blood tests.

Method: The proposed model uses three well-known diverse classifiers, extra trees, random forest and logistic regression, which have different architectures and learning characteristics at the first level, and then combines their predictions by using a second level extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier to achieve a better performance. For data preparation, the proposed methodology employs a KNNImputer algorithm to handle null values in the dataset, isolation forest (iForest) to remove outlier data, and a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to balance data distribution. For model interpretability, features importance are reported by using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique.

Results: The proposed model was trained and evaluated by using a publicly available data set from Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil, which consisted of 5644 data samples with 559 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The ensemble model achieved outstanding performance with an overall accuracy of 99.88% [95% CI: 99.6-100], AUC of 99.38% [95% CI: 97.5-100], a sensitivity of 98.72% [95% CI: 94.6-100] and a specificity of 99.99% [95% CI: 99.99-100].

Discussion: The proposed model revealed better performance when compared against existing state-of-the-art studies (Banerjee et al., 2020; de Freitas Barbosa et al., 2020; de Moraes Batista et al., 2020; Soares et al., 2020) [3,22,56,71] for the same set of features employed by them. As compared to the best performing Bayes Net model (de Freitas Barbosa et al., 2020) [22] average accuracy of 95.159%, ERLX achieved an average accuracy of 99.94%. In comparison with AUC of 85% reported by the SVM model (de Moraes Batista et al., 2020) [56], ERLX obtained AUC of 99.77% in addition to improvements in sensitivity, and specificity. As compared with ER-COV model (Soares et al., 2020) [71] average sensitivity of 70.25% and specificity of 85.98%, ERLX model achieved sensitivity of 99.47% and specificity of 99.99%. The ERLX model obtained a considerably higher score as compared with ANN model (Banerjee et al., 2020) [3] in all performance metrics. Therefore, the model presented is robust and can be deployed for reliable early and rapid screening of COVID-19 patients.",Ensemble learning model for diagnosing COVID-19 from routine blood tests,"AlJame M, Ahmad I, Imtiaz A, Mohammed A.",2020,Inform Med Unlocked,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.imu.2020.100449,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33102686,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aims to obtain complete genome sequence of HPV13 from Mexico,No,"Human papillomavirus type 13 (HPV13) is a low-risk HPV type associated with Multifocal Epithelial Hyperplasia (MEH). It is considered a rare pathology of oral mucosa, more prevalent in certain ethnical groups, such as the Maya from Yucatan in Mexico. As for 2020 only two complete genomes of HPV13 are publicly available in Genbank database (one from Turkey one from the Amazonian). We aimed to obtain the complete genome sequence of HPV13 associated to MEH, obtained from a community in the Mayan area from Mexico. A bank of oral swabs from children with MEH were used. To enrich the sample, a Rolling Cycle Amplification (RCA) method was performed followed by overlapping end-point PCR of 500 bp fragments, Sanger sequencing and assembly. Eight open reading frames (ORFs) were annotated (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, E7, L1 and L2 genes). When compared with the other two previously reported genomes the identity at nucleotide level is high 98.9% and 99.6%, respectively. The phylogenetic tree shows that Yucatan HPV13 is more closely related to HPV13 obtained from the Amazonian. Most changes identified at amino acid level are substitutions derived from nucleotide variations or SNPs in coding regions. Amino-acid changes were observed in E2 and E1 proteins (n ≥ 8), and in L1, L2, E6 and E5 proteins (n ≤ 5). E7 protein from Yucatan has 100% identity with the reported from Amazonian and differs (94.1% identity) with the one from Turkey due to 3 substitutions and three missing amino acids. In conclusion, the genome from HPV13 (7831 bp, 49 nt missing) associated to MEH in the Mayan area from Yucatan was obtained from stored swabs; this is the first effort in Mexico, the second in Latin America, and the third of the world. More research that contributes to the knowledge of the determinants underlying this neglected pathology are urged.","Genomic characterization of human papillomavirus type 13, associated to multifocal epithelial hyperplasia, in a Mayan community","Conde-Ferráez L, Ek-Hernández GE, Canché-Pech JR, Gómez-Carballo JG, Kantún-Moreno NE, González-Losa MDR.",2021,Infect Genet Evol,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104595,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33096300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Proposal to create database about latin america natural products,No,"Around the world, the number of compound databases of natural products in the public domain is rising. This is in line with the increasing synergistic combination of natural product research and chemoinformatics. Toward this global endeavor, countries in Latin America are assembling, curating, and analyzing the contents and diversity of natural products available in their geographical regions. In this manuscript we collect and analyze the efforts that countries in Latin America have made so far to build natural product databases. We further encourage the scientific community in particular in Latin America, to continue their efforts to building quality natural product databases and, whenever possible, to make them publicly accessible. It is proposed that all compound collections could be assembled into a unified resource called LANaPD: Latin American Natural Products Database.

Dataset on neotropical carnivores,No,"Mammalian carnivores are considered a key group in maintaining ecological health and can indicate potential ecological integrity in landscapes where they occur. Carnivores also hold high conservation value and their habitat requirements can guide management and conservation plans. The order Carnivora has 84 species from 8 families in the Neotropical region: Canidae; Felidae; Mephitidae; Mustelidae; Otariidae; Phocidae; Procyonidae; and Ursidae. Herein, we include published and unpublished data on native terrestrial Neotropical carnivores (Canidae; Felidae; Mephitidae; Mustelidae; Procyonidae; and Ursidae). NEOTROPICAL CARNIVORES is a publicly available data set that includes 99,605 data entries from 35,511 unique georeferenced coordinates. Detection/non-detection and quantitative data were obtained from 1818 to 2018 by researchers, governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private consultants. Data were collected using several methods including camera trapping, museum collections, roadkill, line transect, and opportunistic records. Literature (peer-reviewed and grey literature) from Portuguese, Spanish and English were incorporated in this compilation. Most of the data set consists of detection data entries (n = 79,343; 79.7%) but also includes non-detection data (n = 20,262; 20.3%). Of those, 43.3% also include count data (n = 43,151). The information available in NEOTROPICAL CARNIVORES will contribute to macroecological, ecological, and conservation questions in multiple spatio-temporal perspectives. As carnivores play key roles in trophic interactions, a better understanding of their distribution and habitat requirements are essential to establish conservation management plans and safeguard the future ecological health of Neotropical ecosystems. Our data paper, combined with other large-scale data sets, has great potential to clarify species distribution and related ecological processes within the Neotropics.

Using twitter data to identify influence operations,No,"We study how easy it is to distinguish influence operations from organic social media activity by assessing the performance of a platform-agnostic machine learning approach. Our method uses public activity to detect content that is part of coordinated influence operations based on human-interpretable features derived solely from content. We test this method on publicly available Twitter data on Chinese, Russian, and Venezuelan troll activity targeting the United States, as well as the Reddit dataset of Russian influence efforts. To assess how well content-based features distinguish these influence operations from random samples of general and political American users, we train and test classifiers on a monthly basis for each campaign across five prediction tasks. Content-based features perform well across period, country, platform, and prediction task.

Publicly available genomic dataset,Yes,"Objectives: High-throughput sequencing of genomes, exomes, and disease-focused gene panels is becoming increasingly common for molecular diagnostics. However, identifying a single clinically relevant pathogenic variant among thousands of genetic polymorphisms is a challenging task. Publicly available genomic databases are useful resources to filter out common genetic variants present in the population and enable the identification of each disease-causing variant. Based on our experience applying these technologies at Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (HCFMUSP), São Paulo, Brazil, we recognized that the Brazilian population is not adequately represented in widely available genomic databases.

Methods: Here, we took advantage of our 5-year experience as a high-throughput sequencing core facility focused on individuals with putative genetic disorders to build a genomic database that may serve as a more accurate reference for our patient population: SELAdb.

Results/conclusions: Currently, our database comprises a final cohort of 523 unrelated individuals, including patients or family members managed by different clinics of HCFMUSP. We compared SELAdb with other publicly available genomic databases and demonstrated that this population is very heterogeneous, largely resembling Latin American individuals of mixed origin, rather than individuals of pure European ancestry. Interestingly, exclusively through SELAdb, we identified a spectrum of known and potentially novel pathogenic variants in genes associated with highly penetrant Mendelian disorders, illustrating that pathogenic variants circulating in the Brazilian population that is treated in our clinics are underrepresented in other population databases.

Review paper,No,"Background
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a rising health threat with 10 million annual casualties estimated by 2050. Appropriate treatment of infectious diseases with the right antibiotics reduces the spread of antibiotic resistance. Today, clinical practice relies on molecular and PCR techniques for pathogen identification and culture-based antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST). Recently, WGS has started to transform clinical microbiology, enabling prediction of resistance phenotypes from genotypes and allowing for more informed treatment decisions. WGS-based AST (WGS-AST) depends on the detection of AMR markers in sequenced isolates and therefore requires AMR reference databases. The completeness and quality of these databases are material to increase WGS-AST performance.

Methods
We present a systematic evaluation of the performance of publicly available AMR marker databases for resistance prediction on clinical isolates. We used the public databases CARD and ResFinder with a final dataset of 2587 isolates across five clinically relevant pathogens from PATRIC and NDARO, public repositories of antibiotic-resistant bacterial isolates.

Results
CARD and ResFinder WGS-AST performance had an overall balanced accuracy of 0.52 (±0.12) and 0.66 (±0.18), respectively. Major error rates were higher in CARD (42.68%) than ResFinder (25.06%). However, CARD showed almost no very major errors (1.17%) compared with ResFinder (4.42%).

Conclusions
We show that AMR databases need further expansion, improved marker annotations per antibiotic rather than per antibiotic class and validated multivariate marker panels to achieve clinical utility, e.g. in order to meet performance requirements such as provided by the FDA for clinical microbiology diagnostic testing.",Large-scale assessment of antimicrobial resistance marker databases for genetic phenotype prediction: a systematic review,"Mahfouz N, Ferreira I, Beisken S, von Haeseler A, Posch AE.",2020,J Antimicrob Chemother,,,,,,,,10.1093/jac/dkaa257,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32658975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also analysed publicly available RNA-seq data to evaluate if miR146a is differentially expressed in different subtypes of BC,Yes,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in gene expression and affect the development of tumours, including breast cancer (BC). Polymorphisms in miRNA genes can affect the interaction of miRNAs with their target messenger RNA by interfering, creating or disrupting target sites. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2910164, located in the seed region of miR146a, was shown to be associated with BC among different populations. In the present study, we investigated whether rs2910164 is associated with BC in 326 patients and 411 controls from a Brazilian population of predominantly European ancestry. The presence of the allele rs2910164*C was associated with an increased risk of BC (OR=1.4, 95% CI=1.03-1.85, p = 0.03). We also analysed publicly available RNA-seq data to evaluate if miR146a is differentially expressed in different subtypes of BC. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP).

Analysis of datasets of terrestial Carribean arthropod,No,"Background: The immense geologic and ecological complexity of the Caribbean has created a natural laboratory for interpreting when and how organisms disperse through time and space. However, competing hypotheses compounded with this complexity have resulted in a lack of unifying principles of biogeography for the region. Though new data concerning the timing of geologic events and dispersal events are emerging, powerful new analytical tools now allow for explicit hypothesis testing. Arthropods, with varying dispersal ability and high levels of endemism in the Caribbean, are an important, albeit understudied, biogeographic model system. Herein, we include a comprehensive analysis of every publicly available genetic dataset (at the time of writing) of terrestrial Caribbean arthropod groups using a statistically robust pipeline to explicitly test the current extent of biogeographic hypotheses for the region.

Results: Our findings indicate several important biogeographic generalizations for the region: the South American continent is the predominant origin of Caribbean arthropod fauna; GAARlandia played a role for some taxa in aiding dispersal from South America to the Greater Antilles; founder event dispersal explains the majority of dispersal events by terrestrial arthropods, and distance between landmasses is important for dispersal; most dispersal events occurred via island hopping; there is evidence of 'reverse' dispersal from islands to the mainland; dispersal across the present-day Isthmus of Panama generally occurred prior to 3 mya; the Greater Antilles harbor more lineage diversity than the Lesser Antilles, and the larger Greater Antilles typically have greater lineage diversity than the smaller islands; basal Caribbean taxa are primarily distributed in the Greater Antilles, the basal-most being from Cuba, and derived taxa are mostly distributed in the Lesser Antilles; Jamaican taxa are usually endemic and monophyletic.

Conclusions: Given the diversity and deep history of terrestrial arthropods, incongruence of biogeographic patterns is expected, but focusing on both similarities and differences among divergent taxa with disparate life histories emphasizes the importance of particular qualities responsible for resulting diversification patterns. Furthermore, this study provides an analytical toolkit that can be used to guide researchers interested in answering questions pertaining to Caribbean biogeography using explicit hypothesis testing.",Towards a synthesis of the Caribbean biogeography of terrestrial arthropods,"Crews SC, Esposito LA.",2020,BMC Evol Biol,,,,,,,,10.1186/s12862-019-1576-z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31980017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Database for Peruvian Chalcididae,No,"We present the first regional inventory of the fauna of Chalcididae in the Peruvian Amazon, with a nearly 6-fold increase in the number of species recorded for the country. A total of 418 specimens of Chalcididae were collected between 2000 and 2017 at the Panguana Reserve, Peruvian Amazon, 400 of which were obtained using Malaise traps and the remaining 18 specimens by canopy fogging. The morphological analyses indicated that these specimens represent 183 species of Chalcididae in 10 different genera, with 173 new to Peru and 134 potentially new species. We submitted 268 specimens, representing 167 species, to DNA barcoding. Of these, 141 specimens yielded sequences, 136 of them with a minimum of 300 bp. Sixty specimens were assigned a BIN by the Barcode of Life Database System (BOLD), resulting in 50 BINs. A cluster analysis of 138 individuals that yielded DNA sequences longer than 100 bp revealed 118 MOTUs (molecular operative taxonomic units), all of them highly congruent with the morphological data. Prior to the present study, 37 species in 9 genera of Chalcididae were known from Peru. With our results, this number was increased to 210 species in 13 genera.

Gene experiment in mice for liver cancer. Part of it experiment focuses on mTOR signaling from TGCA database of human HCC sample. No specific mention on South America,No,"RuvBL1 is an AAA+ ATPase whose expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) correlates with a poor prognosis. In vitro models suggest that targeting RuvBL1 could be an effective strategy against HCC. However, the role of RuvBL1 in the onset and progression of HCC remains unknown. To address this question, we developed a RuvBL1hep+/− mouse model and evaluated the outcome of DEN-induced liver carcinogenesis up to 12 months of progression. We found that RuvBL1 haploinsufficiency initially delayed the onset of liver cancer, due to a reduced hepatocyte turnover in RuvBL1hep+/− mice. However, RuvBL1hep+/−mice eventually developed HCC nodules that, with aging, grew larger than in the control mice. Moreover, RuvBL1hep+/− mice developed hepatic insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis. We could determine that RuvBL1 regulates insulin signaling through the Akt/mTOR pathway in liver physiology in vivo as well as in normal hepatocytic and HCC cells in vitro. Whole transcriptome analysis of mice livers confirmed the major role of RuvBL1 in the regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism. Finally, RuvBL1 expression was found significantly correlated to glucose metabolism and mTOR signaling by bioinformatic analysis of human HCC sample from the publicly available TGCA database.

Unrelated - dataset on ants and functional richness,No,"There is a growing recognition that spatial scale is important for understanding ecological processes shaping community membership, but empirical evidence on this topic is still scarce. Ecological processes such as environmental filtering can decrease functional differences among species and promote functional clustering of species assemblages, whereas interspecific competition can do the opposite. These different ecological processes are expected to take place at different spatial scales, with competition being more likely at finer scales and environmental filtering most likely at coarser scales. We used a comprehensive dataset on species assemblages of a dominant ant genus, Pheidole, in the Cerrado (savanna) biodiversity hotspot to ask how functional richness relates to species richness gradients and whether such relationships vary across spatial scales. Functional richness of Pheidole assemblages decreased with increasing species richness, but such relationship did not vary across different spatial scales. Species were more functionally dissimilar at finer spatial scales, and functional richness increased less than expected with increasing species richness. Our results indicate a tighter packing of the functional volume as richness increases and point out to a primary role for environmental filtering in shaping membership of Pheidole assemblages in Neotropical savannas.",Functional richness shows spatial scale dependency in Pheidole ant assemblages from Neotropical savannas,"Neves K, Moura MR, Maravalhas J, Pacheco R, Pie MR, Schultz TR, Vasconcelos HL.",2019,Ecol Evol,,,,,,,,10.1002/ece3.5672,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31695883,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Caatinga represents 11% of Brazilian territory and is, in South America, the largest and most biodiverse semi-arid tropical ecoregion, yet only 5% of its territory is covered by Federal Conservation Units, with few collections of flora samples. Thus, providing a georeferenced inventory of existing collections is essential for purposes of species distribution, environmental management and conservation. The aim of this data paper is to gauge, by means of geographic coordinates correction and retrieval of the flora specimens present in the RB Herbarium, the amount of specimen gatherings performed in the Federal Conservation Units belonging to the Caatinga domain.

Analyzes publicly available dataset for RNA sequences of Zika Virus - South America just mentioned in Background. Unsure if necessarily fits inclusions criteria,No,"Background
The concurrent Zika Virus (ZIKV) outbreaks in the United States and Northeast Brazil have evoked global surveillance. Zika infection has been correlated with severe clinical symptoms, such as microcephaly, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other congenital brain abnormalities. Recent data suggest that ZIKV predominantly targets neural progenitor cells leading to neurological impairment. Despite the clinical evidence, detailed experimental mechanism of ZIKV neurotropic pathogenesis has not been fully understood yet. Here we hypothesized that ZIKV produces miRNAs, which target essential host genes involved in various cellular pathways facilitating their survival through immune evasion and progression of disease during brain development.

Methods
From genome sequence information using several bioinformatic tools, we predicted pri-miRNAs, pre-miRNAs, and finally the mature miRNAs produced by ZIKV. We also identified their target genes and performed functional enrichment analysis to identify the biological processes associated with these genes. Finally, we analyzed a publicly available RNA-seq data set to determine the altered expression level of the targeted genes.

Results
From ZIKV genome sequence, we identified and validated 47 putative novel miRNAs. Functional enrichment of the targeted genes demonstrates the involvement of various biological pathways regulating cellular signaling, neurological functions, cancer, and fetal development. The expression analysis of these genes showed that ZIKV-produced miRNAs downregulate the key genes involved in these pathways, which in turn may lead to impaired brain development.

Conclusions
Our finding proposes novel ZIKV miRNAs and their targets, which upon experimental validation could help developing new therapeutics to combat ZIKV infection and minimize ZIKV-mediated pathologies.",In silico analysis revealed Zika virus miRNAs associated with viral pathogenesis through alteration of host genes involved in immune response and neurological functions,"Islam MS, Khan MA, Murad MW, Karim M, Islam ABMMK.",2019,J Med Virol,,,,,,,,10.1002/jmv.25505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31095749,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Focuses on training and testing skills of Pathologists in Asia and South America - no database,No,"Pathology training resources remain scarce in many parts of the world. With rapid economic development comes the need to educate new pathologists to meet the medical care demands. Our aim was to set up a cost-effective system for training and testing the diagnostic skills of pathologists. Pathologists in nine countries in Asia and South America were invited by the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) to participate in a prostate pathology education course combining image-based tests with lectures and on-line tutorials. The tests and tutorials are available free of charge at the ISUP education website www.edu.isupweb.org . A total of 603 pathologists registered on the website. Of these, 224 completed pre- and post-lecture assessments (tests 1 and 2). Replies were classified as correct/acceptable, when a lesion was accurately classified into clinically relevant categories (benign, cancer, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal carcinoma of the prostate). The rate of correct/acceptable replies increased from 60.7 to 72.3% in Tests 1 and 2, respectively. In Test 1, pathologists from upper middle, lower middle, and low resource countries gave a correct/acceptable diagnosis in 65.8%, 61.0%, and 47.4%, respectively. Their results improved in Test 2 to 76.4%, 72.5%, and 62.8%, respectively. The greatest improvement in diagnostic ability was achieved in pathologists from the low resource group of countries.

Unrelated - Focused on data coding of SNPs - uses dataset of wheat,No,"Abstract
Mixed models can be considered as a type of penalized regression and are everyday tools in statistical genetics. The standard mixed model for whole genome regression (WGR) is ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RRBLUP) which is based on an additive marker effect model. Many publications have extended the additive WGR approach by incorporating interactions between loci or between genes and environment. In this context of penalized regressions with interactions, it has been reported that translating the coding of single nucleotide polymorphisms -for instance from -1,0,1 to 0,1,2- has an impact on the prediction of genetic values and interaction effects. In this work, we identify the reason for the relevance of variable coding in the general context of penalized polynomial regression. We show that in many cases, predictions of the genetic values are not invariant to translations of the variable coding, with an exception when only the sizes of the coefficients of monomials of highest total degree are penalized. The invariance of RRBLUP can be considered as a special case of this setting, with a polynomial of total degree 1, penalizing additive effects (total degree 1) but not the fixed effect (total degree 0). The extended RRBLUP (eRRBLUP), which includes interactions, is not invariant to translations because it does not only penalize interactions (total degree 2), but also additive effects (total degree 1). This observation implies that translation-invariance can be maintained in a pair-wise epistatic WGR if only interaction effects are penalized, but not the additive effects. In this regard, approaches of pre-selecting loci may not only reduce computation time, but can also help to avoid the variable coding issue. To illustrate the practical relevance, we compare different regressions on a publicly available wheat data set. We show that for an eRRBLUP, the relevance of the marker coding for interaction effect estimates increases with the number of variables included in the model. A biological interpretation of estimated interaction effects may therefore become more difficult. Consequently, comparing reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) approaches to WGR approaches modeling effects explicitly, the supposed advantage of an increased interpretability of the latter may not be real. Our theoretical results are generally valid for penalized regressions, for instance also for the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Moreover, they apply to any type of interaction modeled by products of predictor variables in a penalized regression approach or by Hadamard products of covariance matrices in a mixed model.",Lost in Translation: On the Problem of Data Coding in Penalized Whole Genome Regression with Interactions,"Martini JWR, Rosales F, Ha NT, Heise J, Wimmer V, Kneib T.",2019,G3 (Bethesda),,,,,,,,10.1534/g3.118.200961,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30760541,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dataset for Leishmania,No,"Leishmania is a protozoan parasite causing several disease presentations collectively known as leishmaniasis. Pathogenic species of Leishmania are divided into two subgenera, L. (Leishmania) and L. (Viannia). Species belonging to the Viannia subgenus have only been reported in Central and South America. These species predominantly cause cutaneous leishmaniasis, but in some cases, parasites can migrate to the nasopharyngeal area and cause a highly disfiguring mucocutaneous presentation. Despite intensive efforts, no effective antileishmanial vaccine is available for use in humans, although a few candidates mainly designed for L. (Leishmania) species are now in clinical trials. After sequencing the genome of Leishmania panamensis, we noticed a high degree of sequence divergence among several orthologous proteins from both subgenera. Consequently, some of the previously published candidates may not work properly for species of the Viannia subgenus. To help in vaccine design, we predicted CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes in the theoretical proteomes of four strains belonging to the Viannia subgenus. Prediction was performed with at least two independent bioinformatics tools, using the most frequent human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II alleles in the affected geographic area. Although predictions resulted in millions of peptides, relatively few of them were predicted to bind to several MHC alleles and can therefore be considered promiscuous epitopes. Comparison of our results to previous applications to species of the Leishmania subgenus confirmed that approximately half of the reported candidates are not present in Viannia proteins with a threshold of 80% sequence similarity and coverage. However, our prediction methodology was able to predict 70–100% of the candidates that could be found in Viannia.

Methods: Three publicly available Affymetrix gene expression data sets (GSE5787, GSE7803, GSE9750) were retrieved, vouching for a total 9 cervical cancer cell lines, 39 normal cervical samples, 7 CIN3 samples and 111 cervical cancer samples. An Agilent data set (GSE7410; 5 normal cervical samples, 35 samples from invasive cervical cancer) was selected as a validation set. Predication analysis of microarrays was performed in the Affymetrix sets to identify cervical cancer biomarkers. We compared the lists of differentially expressed genes between normal and CIN3 samples on the one hand (n=1923) and between CIN3 and invasive cancer samples on the other hand (n=628).

Results: Seven probe sets were identified that were significantly overexpressed (at least 2 fold increase expression level, and false discovery rate <5%) in both CIN3 samples respective to normal samples and in cancer samples respective to CIN3 samples. From these, five probes sets could be validated in the Agilent data set (P<0.001) comparing the normal with the invasive cancer samples, corresponding to the genes DTL, HMGB3, KIF2C, NEK2 and RFC4. These genes were additionally overexpressed in cervical cancer cell lines respective to the cancer samples. The literature on these markers was reviewed.

Botanical Garden dataset,No,": This paper provides a quantitative and general description of the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden herbarium (RB) dataset. Created over a century ago, the RB currently comprises ca. 750,000 mounted specimens, with a strong representation of Brazilian flora, mainly from the Atlantic and Amazon forests. Nearly 100% of these specimens have been entered into the database and imaged and, at present, about 17% have been geo-referenced. This data paper is focused exclusively on RB's exsiccatae collection of land plants and algae, which is currently increasing by about twenty to thirty thousand specimens per year thanks to fieldwork, exchange and donations. Since 2005, many national and international projects have been implemented, improving the quality and accessibility of the collection. The most important facilitating factor in this process was the creation of the institutional system for plants collection and management, named JABOT. Since the RB is continuously growing, the dataset is updated weekly on SiBBr and GBIF portals.

New information: The most represented environments are the Atlantic and Amazon forests, a biodiversity hotspot and the world's largest rain forest, respectively. The dataset described in this article contains the data and metadata of plants and algae specimens in the RB collection and the link to access the respective images. Currently, the RB data is publicly available online at several biodiversity portals, such as our institutional database JABOT, the Reflora Virtual Herbarium, the SiBBr and the GBIF portal.

Datasequencing for Leishmania (parasite),No,"To identify putative cis-elements involved in gene expression regulation in Leishmania, we previously conducted an in silico investigation to find conserved intercoding sequences (CICS) in the genomes of L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis. Here, the CICS databank was explored to search for sequences that were present in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of groups of genes showing similar expression profiles during in vitro differentiation. Using a selectable marker as a reporter gene, flanked by either an intact 3' UTR or a UTR lacking the conserved element, the regulatory role of a CICS was confirmed. We observed that the pattern of modulation of the mRNA levels was altered in the absence of the CICS. We also identified putative CICS RNA-binding proteins. This study suggests that the publicly available CICS database is a useful tool for identifying regulatory cis-elements for Leishmania genes and suggests the existence of post-transcriptional regulons in Leishmania.",Disclosing 3' UTR cis-elements and putative partners involved in gene expression regulation in Leishmania spp,"Terrão MC, Rosas de Vasconcelos EJ, Defina TA, Myler PJ, Cruz AK.",2017,PLoS One,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0183401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28859096,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coxsackie A16 data,No,"Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16; Picornaviridae) is an enterovirus (EV) type associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. To investigate the spatial spread of CV-A16, we used viral sequence data sampled during a prospective sentinel surveillance of HFMD in France (2010 to 2014) and phylogenetic reconstruction. A data set of 168 VP1 sequences was assembled with 416 publicly available sequences of various geographic origins. The CV-A16 sequences reported were assigned to two clades, genogroup B and a previously uncharacterized clade D. The time origins of clades B and D were assessed in 1978 (1973 to 1981) and 2004 (2001 to 2007), respectively. The shape of the global CV-A16 phylogeny indicated worldwide cocirculation of genetically distinct virus lineages over time and across geographic regions. Phylogenetic tree topologies and Bayes factor analysis indicated virus migration. Virus transportation events in clade B within Europe and Asia and between countries of the two geographic regions were assessed. The sustained transmission of clade D viruses over 4 years was analyzed at the township level in France and traced back to Peru in South America. Comparative genomics provided evidence of recombination between CV-A16 clades B and D and suggested an intertype recombinant origin for clade D. Time-resolved phylogenies and HFMD surveillance data indicated that CV-A16 persistence is sustained by continuing virus migration at different geographic scales, from community transmission to virus transportation between distant countries.

Focuses on Immigrants in top 1% of US,No,"Economic inequality in the United States is extreme, but little is known about the national origin of affluent households. Households in the top one percent by total wealth own vastly disproportionate quantities of household assets and have correspondingly high levels of economic, social, and political influence. The overrepresentation of white natives (i.e., those born in the U.S.) among high-wealth households is well-documented, but changing migration dynamics suggest that a growing portion of top households may be immigrants.

Methods
Because no single survey dataset contains top wealth holders and data about country of origin, this paper uses two publicly-available data sets: the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Multiple imputation is used to impute country of birth from the SIPP into the SCF. Descriptive statistics are used to demonstrate reliability of the method, to estimate the prevalence of immigrants among top wealth holders, and to document patterns of asset ownership among affluent immigrants.

Results
Significant numbers of top wealth holders who are usually classified as white natives may be immigrants. Many top wealth holders appear to be European and Canadian immigrants, and increasing numbers of top wealth holders are likely from Asia and Latin America as well. Results suggest that of those in the top one percent of wealth holders, approximately 3% are European and Canadian immigrants, .5% are from Mexico or Cuban, and 1.7% are from Asia (especially Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mainland China, and India). Ownership of key assets varies considerably across affluent immigrant groups.

Conclusion
Although the percentage of top wealth holders who are immigrants is relatively small, these percentages represent large numbers of households with considerable resources and corresponding social and political influence. Evidence that the propensity to allocate wealth to real and financial assets varies across immigrant groups suggests that wealth ownership is more global than previous research suggests and that immigrant groups are likely to become more prevalent in top wealth positions in the U.S. As the representation of immigrants in top wealth positions grows, their economic, social, and political influence is likely to increase as well.",Immigrants in the one percent: The national origin of top wealth owners,"Keister LA, Aronson B.",2017,PLoS One,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0172876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28231335,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Discusses use of publicly available dataset regarding novel biotechnological processes for anticancer compounds. Unsure of South America involvement - Cambia has international scope,No,"Background: Resveratrol, taxol, podophyllotoxin, withanolides and their derivatives find applications in anti-cancer therapy. They are plant-derived compounds whose chemical structures and synthesis limit their natural availability and restrict a large-scale industrial production. Hence, their production by various biotechnological approaches may hold promise for a continuous and reliable mode of supply.

Objective: We review process and product patents in this regard.

Methods: Accordingly, we provide a general outline to search the freely accessible WIPO, EPO, USPTO and Cambia databases with several keywords and patent codes. We have tabulated both granted and filed patents from the said databases.

Results and conclusion: We retrieved ~40 patents from these databases. Novel biotechnological processes for production of these anticancer compounds include Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated hairy root culture, suspension culture, cell culture with elicitors, use of recombinant microorganisms, and bioreactors among others. The results are indicative of being both database-specific as well as queryspecific. A ten-year search window yielded 33 patents. The utility of the search strategy is discussed in the light of biotechnological developments in the field. Those who examine patent literature using similar search strategies may complement their knowledge obtained from perusal of mainstream journal resources.

Focuses on databases about multiple species,No,"Aim: Massive digitalization of natural history collections is now leading to a steep accumulation of publicly available species distribution data. However, taxonomic errors and geographical uncertainty of species occurrence records are now acknowledged by the scientific community - putting into question to what extent such data can be used to unveil correct patterns of biodiversity and distribution. We explore this question through quantitative and qualitative analyses of uncleaned versus manually verified datasets of species distribution records across different spatial scales.

Location: The American tropics.

Methods: As test case we used the plant tribe Cinchoneae (Rubiaceae). We compiled four datasets of species occurrences: one created manually and verified through classical taxonomic work, and the rest derived from GBIF under different cleaning and filling schemes. We used new bioinformatic tools to code species into grids, ecoregions, and biomes following WWF's classification. We analysed species richness and altitudinal ranges of the species.

Results: Altitudinal ranges for species and genera were correctly inferred even without manual data cleaning and filling. However, erroneous records affected spatial patterns of species richness. They led to an overestimation of species richness in certain areas outside the centres of diversity in the clade. The location of many of these areas comprised the geographical midpoint of countries and political subdivisions, assigned long after the specimens had been collected.

Main conclusion: Open databases and integrative bioinformatic tools allow a rapid approximation of large-scale patterns of biodiversity across space and altitudinal ranges. We found that geographic inaccuracy affects diversity patterns more than taxonomic uncertainties, often leading to false positives, i.e. overestimating species richness in relatively species poor regions. Public databases for species distribution are valuable and should be more explored, but under scrutiny and validation by taxonomic experts. We suggest that database managers implement easy ways of community feedback on data quality.

Review paper,No,"Introduction: The WHO recommends annual influenza vaccination to prevent influenza illness in high-risk groups. Little is known about national influenza immunization policies globally.

Material and methods: The 2014 WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form (JRF) on Immunization was adapted to capture data on influenza immunization policies. We combined this dataset with additional JRF information on new vaccine introductions and strength of immunization programmes, as well as publicly available data on country economic status. Data from countries that did not complete the JRF were sought through additional sources. We described data on country influenza immunization policies and used bivariate analyses to identify factors associated with having such policies.

Results: Of 194 WHO Member States, 115 (59%) reported having a national influenza immunization policy in 2014. Among countries with a national policy, programmes target specific WHO-defined risk groups, including pregnant women (42%), young children (28%), adults with chronic illnesses (46%), the elderly (45%), and health care workers (47%). The Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific were the WHO regions that had the highest percentages of countries reporting that they had national influenza immunization policies. Compared to countries without policies, countries with policies were significantly more likely to have the following characteristics: to be high or upper middle income (p<0.0001); to have introduced birth dose hepatitis B virus vaccine (p<0.0001), pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (p=0.032), or human papilloma virus vaccine (p=0.002); to have achieved global goals for diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine coverage (p<0.0001); and to have a functioning National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (p<0.0001).

Conclusions: The 2014 revision of the JRF permitted a global assessment of national influenza immunization policies. The 59% of countries reporting that they had policies are wealthier, use more new or under-utilized vaccines, and have stronger immunization systems. Addressing disparities in public health resources and strengthening immunization systems may facilitate influenza vaccine introduction and use.

"Image dataset, publically available, based in Germany.",No,"Automatic recognition of different tissue types in histological images is an essential part in the digital pathology toolbox. Texture analysis is commonly used to address this problem; mainly in the context of estimating the tumour/stroma ratio on histological samples. However, although histological images typically contain more than two tissue types, only few studies have addressed the multi-class problem. For colorectal cancer, one of the most prevalent tumour types, there are in fact no published results on multiclass texture separation. In this paper we present a new dataset of 5,000 histological images of human colorectal cancer including eight different types of tissue. We used this set to assess the classification performance of a wide range of texture descriptors and classifiers. As a result, we found an optimal classification strategy that markedly outperformed traditional methods, improving the state of the art for tumour-stroma separation from 96.9% to 98.6% accuracy and setting a new standard for multiclass tissue separation (87.4% accuracy for eight classes).

"Health-related, mentions publicly available dataset (unsure of which), no mention of south america",No,"Abstract
Peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADI) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the poorly understood posttranslational modification converting arginine residues into citrullines. In this study, the role of PADIs in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer was investigated. Specifically, RNA expression was analyzed and its association with survival in a cohort of 98 colorectal cancer patient specimens with matched adjacent mucosa and 50 controls from donors without cancer. Key results were validated in an independent collection of tumors with matched adjacent mucosa and by mining of a publicly available expression data set. Protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting for cell lines or IHC for patient specimens that further included 24 cases of adenocarcinoma with adjacent dysplasia and 11 cases of active ulcerative colitis. The data indicate that PADI2 is the dominantly expressed PADI enzyme in colon mucosa and is upregulated during differentiation. PADI2 expression is low or absent in colorectal cancer. Frequently, this occurs already at the stage of low-grade dysplasia. Mucosal PADI2 expression is also low in ulcerative colitis. The expression level of PADI2 in tumor and adjacent mucosa correlates with differential survival: low levels associate with poor prognosis.

Implications: Downregulation of PADI2 is an early event in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer associated with poor prognosis and points toward a possible role of citrullination in modulating tumor cells and their microenvironment.

Focuses on virus for dogs prevalent in brazil,No,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a highly contagious pathogen for domestic dogs and several wild carnivore species. In Brazil, natural infection of CDV in dogs is very high due to the large non-vaccinated dog population, a scenario that calls for new studies on the molecular epidemiology. This study investigates the phylodynamics and amino-acid signatures of CDV epidemic in South America by analyzing a large dataset compiled from publicly available sequences and also by collecting new samples from Brazil. A population of 175 dogs with canine distemper (CD) signs was sampled, from which 89 were positive for CDV, generating 42 new CDV sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the new and publicly available sequences revealed that Brazilian sequences mainly clustered in South America 1 (SA1) clade, which has its origin estimated to the late 1980's. The reconstruction of the demographic history in SA1 clade showed an epidemic expanding until the recent years, doubling in size every nine years. SA1 clade epidemic distinguished from the world CDV epidemic by the emergence of the R580Q strain, a very rare and potentially detrimental substitution in the viral genome. The R580Q substitution was estimated to have happened in one single evolutionary step in the epidemic history in SA1 clade, emerging shortly after introduction to the continent. Moreover, a high prevalence (11.9%) of the Y549H mutation was observed among the domestic dogs sampled here. This finding was associated (p < 0.05) with outcome-death and higher frequency in mixed-breed dogs, the later being an indicator of a continuous exchange of CDV strains circulating among wild carnivores and domestic dogs. The results reported here highlight the diversity of the worldwide CDV epidemic and reveal local features that can be valuable for combating the disease.",Phylogenetic analysis of canine distemper virus in South America clade 1 reveals unique molecular signatures of the local epidemic,"Fischer CDB, Gräf T, Ikuta N, Lehmann FKM, Passos DT, Makiejczuk A, Silveira MAT Jr, Fonseca ASK, Canal CW, Lunge VR.",2016,Infect Genet Evol,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.meegid.2016.03.029,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27060756,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis of publicly available data from the Food and Nutrition National Center (CENAN, Peru), period 2009-2010. The Prevalence ratio of obesity and abdominal obesity was determined as a measure of association. Obesity and abdominal obesity were diagnosed based on direct anthropometric measurements.

Results: The final data set consisted of 31,549 individuals ≥20 years old. The prevalence ratio of obesity was as follows: 1.00 between 0 and 499 m (reference category), 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.87-1.16) between 500-1,499 m, 0.74 (0.63-0.86) between 1,500-2,999 m, and 0.54 (0.45-0.64) at ≥3,000 m, adjusting for age, sex, self-reported physical activity, out-migration rate, urbanization, poverty, education, and geographical latitude and longitude. In the same order, the adjusted prevalence ratio of abdominal obesity was 1.00, 1.01 (0.94-1.07), 0.93 (0.87-0.99), and 0.89 (0.82-0.95), respectively. We found an interaction between altitude and sex and between altitude and age (P < 0.001, for both interactions) on the association with obesity and abdominal obesity.

Conclusions: Among Peruvian adult individuals, we found an inverse association between altitude and obesity, adjusting for multiple covariates.

Dataset of parasite genome,No,"Leishmania, a genus of parasites transmitted to human hosts and mammalian/reptilian reservoirs by an insect vector, is the causative agent of the human disease complex leishmaniasis. The evolutionary relationships within the genus Leishmania and its origins are the source of ongoing debate, reflected in conflicting phylogenetic and biogeographic reconstructions. This study employs a recently described bioinformatics method, SISRS, to identify over 200,000 informative sites across the genome from newly sequenced and publicly available Leishmania data. This dataset is used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of this genus. Additionally, we constructed a large multi-gene dataset, using it to reconstruct the phylogeny and estimate divergence dates for species. We conclude that the genus Leishmania evolved at least 90-100 million years ago, supporting a modified version of the Multiple Origins hypothesis that we call the Supercontinent hypothesis. According to this scenario, separate Leishmania clades emerged prior to, and during, the breakup of Gondwana. Additionally, we confirm that reptile-infecting Leishmania are derived from mammalian forms and that the species that infect porcupines and sloths form a clade long separated from other species. Finally, we firmly place the guinea-pig infecting species, Leishmaniaenriettii, the globally dispersed Leishmaniasiamensis, and the newly identified Australian species from a kangaroo, as sibling species whose distribution arises from the ancient connection between Australia, Antarctica, and South America.",Phylogenomic reconstruction supports supercontinent origins for Leishmania,"Harkins KM, Schwartz RS, Cartwright RA, Stone AC.",2016,Infect Genet Evol,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.11.030,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26708057,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Identifies biomedical journals, includes south america, but doesn't tackle health directly - collection of spanish language biomedical journals from spain and latin america",No,"Abstract
Objectives
Journals in languages other than English that publish original clinical research are often not well covered in the main biomedical databases and therefore often not included in systematic reviews. This study aimed to identify Spanish language biomedical journals from Spain and Latin America and to describe their main features.

Methods
Journals were identified in electronic databases, publishers' catalogues and local registries. Eligibility was determined by assessing data from these sources or the journals' websites, when available.

Findings
A total of 2457 journals were initially identified; 1498 met inclusion criteria. Spain (27.3%), Mexico (16.0%), Argentina (15.1%) and Chile (11.9%) had the highest number of journals. Most (85.8%) are currently active; 87.8% have an ISSN. The median and mean length of publication were 22 and 29 years, respectively. A total of 66.0% were indexed in at least one database; 3.0% had an impact factor in 2012. A total of 845 journals had websites (56.4%), of which 700 (82.8%) were searchable and 681 (80.6%) free of charge.

Conclusions
Most of the identified journals have no impact factor or are not indexed in any of the major databases.

About maize,No,"The present study provides an assessment of the compositional diversity in maize B73 hybrids derived both from the Nested Association Mapping (NAM) founder lines and from a diverse collection of landrace accessions from North and South America. The NAM founders represent a key population of publicly available lines that are used extensively in the maize community to investigate the genetic basis of complex traits. Landraces are also of interest to the maize community as they offer the potential to discover new alleles that could be incorporated into modern maize lines. The compositional analysis of B73 hybrids from the 25 NAM founders and 24 inbred lines derived from landraces included measurements of proximates (protein, fat, ash, and starch), fibers, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids, tocopherols (α-, γ-, and δ-), β-carotene, phytic acid, and raffinose. Grain was harvested from a replicated trial in New York, USA. For each data set (NAM and landrace) canonical discriminant analysis allowed separation of distinct breeding groups (tropical, temperate, flint, mixed/intermediate) within each data set. Overall, results highlighted extensive variation in all composition components assessed for both sets of hybrids. The variation observed for some components within the landraces may therefore be of value for increasing their levels in modern maize lines. The study described here provided significant information on contributions of conventional breeding to crop compositional variation, as well as valuable information on key genetic resources for the maize community in the development of new improved lines.",Compositional assessments of key maize populations: B73 hybrids of the Nested Association Mapping founder lines and diverse landrace inbred lines,"Venkatesh TV, Harrigan GG, Perez T, Flint-Garcia S.",2015,J Agric Food Chem,,,,,,,,10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25966324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA database of human and pathogenic fungi. No specific mention of south america; health adjacent,No,"Human and animal fungal pathogens are a growing threat worldwide leading to emerging infections and creating new risks for established ones. There is a growing need for a rapid and accurate identification of pathogens to enable early diagnosis and targeted antifungal therapy. Morphological and biochemical identification methods are time-consuming and require trained experts. Alternatively, molecular methods, such as DNA barcoding, a powerful and easy tool for rapid monophasic identification, offer a practical approach for species identification and less demanding in terms of taxonomical expertise. However, its wide-spread use is still limited by a lack of quality-controlled reference databases and the evolving recognition and definition of new fungal species/complexes.

A new database, containing 2800 ITS sequences representing 421 fungal species, providing the medical community with a freely accessible tool at http://www.isham.org/ and http://its.mycologylab.org/ to rapidly and reliably identify most agents of mycoses, was established. The generated sequences included in the new database were used to evaluate the variation and overall utility of the ITS region for the identification of pathogenic fungi at intra-and interspecies level. The average intraspecies variation ranged from 0 to 2.25%.

The present paper reports an overview of the difficulties and errors encountered in the generation of databases used for the published PLD models. A new database of 466 compounds was constructed from seven literature sources, containing only publicly available compounds. A comparison of the PLD assignations in selected databases proved useful in revealing some inconsistencies and raised doubts about the previously assigned PLD+ and PLD- classifications for some chemicals. Finally, a Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) approach was also applied, revealing further anomalies and clearly showing that metabolism as well as data quality must be taken into account when generating accurate methods for predicting the likelihood that a compound will induce PLD.

Sequence-based methods, such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST), offer many advantages over serotyping. An MLST scheme was previously proposed for H. parasuis but genome sequence data only recently available reveals the primers recommended, based on sequences of related bacteria, are not optimal. Here we report modifications to enhance the original method, including primer redesign to eliminate mismatches with H. parasuis sequences and to avoid regions of high sequence heterogeneity, standardization of primer T(m)s and identification of universal PCR conditions that result in robust and reproducible amplification of all targets. The modified typing method was applied to a collection of 127 isolates from North and South America, Europe and Asia. An alignment of the concatenated sequences obtained from seven target housekeeping genes identified 278 variable nucleotide sites that define 116 unique sequence types. A comparison of the original and modified methods using a subset of 86 isolates indicates little difference in overall locus diversity, discriminatory power or in the clustering of strains within Neighbor-Joining trees. Data from the optimized MLST were used to populate a newly created and publicly available H. parasuis database. An accompanying database designed to capture provenance and epidemiological information for each isolate was also created. The modified MLST scheme is highly discriminatory but more robust, reproducible and user-friendly than the original. The MLST database provides a novel resource for investigation of H. parasuis outbreaks and for tracking strain evolution.",A curated public database for multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and analysis of Haemophilus parasuis based on an optimized typing scheme,"Mullins MA, Register KB, Brunelle BW, Aragon V, Galofré-Mila N, Bayles DO, Jolley KA.",2013,Vet Microbiol,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.11.019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23218953,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Creation of dataset specific to Chile, but about fish genome",No,"The marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, locally known as the “loco”, is the main target species of the benthonic Chilean fisheries. Genetic and genomic tools are necessary to study the genome of this species in order to understand the molecular basis of its development, growth, and other key traits to improve the management strategies and to identify local adaptation to prevent loss of biodiversity. Here, we use pyrosequencing technologies to generate the first transcriptomic database from adult specimens of the loco. After trimming, a total of 140,756 Expressed Sequence Tag sequences were achieved. Clustering and assembly analysis identified 19,219 contigs and 105,435 singleton sequences. BlastN analysis showed a significant identity with Expressed Sequence Tags of different gastropod species available in public databases. Similarly, BlastX results showed that only 895 out of the total 124,654 had significant hits and may represent novel genes for marine gastropods. From this database, simple sequence repeat motifs were also identified and a total of 38 primer pairs were designed and tested to assess their potential as informative markers and to investigate their cross-species amplification in different related gastropod species. This dataset represents the first publicly available 454 data for a marine gastropod endemic to the southeastern Pacific coast, providing a valuable transcriptomic resource for future efforts of gene discovery and development of functional markers in other marine gastropods.","Transcriptome analysis in Concholepas concholepas (Gastropoda, Muricidae): mining and characterization of new genomic and molecular markers","Cárdenas L, Sánchez R, Gomez D, Fuenzalida G, Gallardo-Escárate C, Tanguy A.",2011,Mar Genomics,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.margen.2011.05.002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21867972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No database, no health, no south america",No,"The agnostic screening performed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has uncovered associations for previously unsuspected genes. Knowledge about the functional role of these genes is crucial and laboratory mouse models can provide such information. Here, we describe a systematic juxtaposition of human GWAS-discovered loci versus mouse models in order to appreciate the availability of mouse models data, to gain biological insights for the role of these genes and to explore the extent of concordance between these two lines of evidence. We perused publicly available data (NHGRI database for human associations and Mouse Genome Informatics database for mouse models) and employed two alternative approaches for cross-species comparisons, phenotype- and gene-centric. A total of 293 single gene-phenotype human associations (262 unique genes and 69 unique phenotypes) were evaluated. In the phenotype-centric approach, we identified all mouse models and related ortholog genes for the 51 human phenotypes with a comparable phenotype in mice. A total of 27 ortholog genes were found to be associated with the same phenotype in humans and mice, a concordance that was significantly larger than expected by chance (p<0.001). In the gene-centric approach, we were able to locate at least 1 knockout model for 60% of the 262 genes. The knockouts for 35% of these orthologs displayed pre- or post-natal lethality. For the remaining non-lethal orthologs, the same organ system was involved in mice and humans in 71% of the cases (p<0.001). Our project highlights the wealth of available information from mouse models for human GWAS, catalogues extensive information on plausible physiologic implications for many genes, provides hypothesis-generating findings for additional GWAS analyses and documents that the concordance between human and mouse genetic association is larger than expected by chance and can be informative.",Laboratory mouse models for the human genome-wide associations,"Kitsios GD, Tangri N, Castaldi PJ, Ioannidis JP.",2010,PLoS One,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0013782,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21072174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Creates publically available dataset but not realth related or specific to South America ; focsuses on AU-rich elements in vertebrate,No,"AREsite is an online resource for the detailed investigation of AU-rich elements (ARE) in vertebrate mRNA 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs). AREs are one of the most prominent cis-acting regulatory elements found in 3'-UTRs of mRNAs. Various ARE-binding proteins that possess RNA stabilizing or destabilizing functions are recruited by sequence-specific motifs. Recent findings suggest an essential role of the structural mRNA context in which these sequence motifs are embedded. AREsite is the first database that allows to quantify the structuredness of ARE motif sites in terms of opening energies and accessibility probabilities. Moreover, we also provide a detailed phylogenetic analysis of ARE motifs and incorporate information about experimentally validated targets of the ARE-binding proteins TTP, HuR and Auf1.

Utilizes publically available database but no mention of South America or health,No,"Two Solanum genotypes, a wild relative of cultivated potato S. cajamarquense (Cjm) and an advanced tetraploid clone B3C1 (B3), were inoculated with two Phytophthora infestans isolates and leaves were sampled at 72 and 96 h after inoculation. Gene expression in the inoculated versus noninoculated samples was monitored using the Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR) 10K potato array and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The current experiment is study number 83 of the TIGR expression profiling service project, and all data are publicly available in the Solanaceae Gene Expression Database (SGED) at ftp://ftp.tigr.org/pub/data/s_tuberosum/SGED. Differentially regulated cDNA clones were selected separately for each isolate-time point interaction by significant analysis of microarray (SAM), and differentially regulated clones were classified into functional categories by MapMan. The results show that the genes activated in B3 and Cjm have largely the same biological functions and are commonly activated when plants respond to pathogen attack. The genes activated within biological function categories were considerably different between the genotypes studied, suggesting that the defence pathways activated in B3 and Cjm during the tested conditions may involve unique genes. However, as indicated by real-time RT-PCR, some of the genes thought to be genotype specific may be activated across genotypes at other time points during disease development.",Comparison of transcript profiles in late blight-challenged Solanum cajamarquense and B3C1 potato clones,"Lindqvist-Kreuze H, Carbajulca D, Gonzalez-Escobedo G, Pérez W, Bonierbale M.",2010,Mol Plant Pathol,,,,,,,,10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00622.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20618709,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Creation of publicly available database for Lesihmania genome but is not specific to solely South America,No,"A panel of microsatellites mapped to the Leishmania genome might make it possible to find associations between specific loci and phenotypic traits. To identify such loci, a Perl programme was written that scans the sequence of a genome and writes all loci containing microsatellites to a MySQL database. The programme was applied to the sequences of the L. braziliensis, L. infantum and L. major genomes. The database is publicly available over the internet: http://www.genomics.liv.ac.uk/tryps/resources.html 'Microsatellite Locus Extractor', and allows the selection of mapped microsatellites that meet user-defined criteria from a specified region of the selected genome. The website also incorporates a primer design pipeline that will design primers to amplify the selected loci. Using this pipeline 12 out of 17 primer sets designed against the L. infantum genome generated polymorphic PCR products. A tailed primer protocol was used to label all microsatellite primers with a single set of labelled primers. To avoid the culture of parasites prior to genotyping, sets of nested PCR primers were developed to amplify parasite DNA eluted from microscope slides. The limit of detection was approximately 1.6 parasite equivalents. However, only 6/56 DNA from slides stored at ambient temperature for over 6 months gave positive PCR results.","An integrated pipeline for the development of novel panels of mapped microsatellite markers for Leishmania donovani complex, Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania major","Fakhar M, Motazedian MH, Daly D, Lowe CD, Kemp SJ, Noyes HA.",2008,Parasitology,,,,,,,,10.1017/S0031182008004186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18371241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Creation of an open database about complementary and alternative medicine  but has no mention of south america,No,"The term ""Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)"" covers a variety of approaches to medical theory and practice, which are not commonly accepted by representatives of conventional medicine. In the past two decades, these approaches have been studied in various areas of medicine. Although there appears to be a growing number of scientific publications on CAM, the complete spectrum of complementary therapies still requires more information about published evidence. A majority of these research publications are still not listed in electronic bibliographical databases such as MEDLINE. However, with a growing demand by patients for such therapies, physicians increasingly need an overview of scientific publications on CAM. Bearing this in mind, CAMbase, a bibliographical database on CAM was launched in order to close this gap. It can be accessed online free of charge or additional costs. The user can peruse more than 80,000 records from over 30 journals and periodicals on CAM, which are stored in CAMbase. A special search engine performing syntactical and semantical analysis of textual phrases allows the user quickly to find relevant bibliographical information on CAM. Between August 2003 and July 2006, 43,299 search queries, an average of 38 search queries per day, were registered focussing on CAM topics such as acupuncture, cancer or general safety aspects. Analysis of the requests led to the conclusion that CAMbase is not only used by scientists and researchers but also by physicians and patients who want to find out more about CAM. Closely related to this effort is our aim to establish a modern library center on Complementary Medicine which offers the complete spectrum of a modern digital library including a document delivery-service for physicians, therapists, scientists and researchers.",CAMbase--a XML-based bibliographical database on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM),"Ostermann T, Zillmann H, Raak CK, Buessing A, Matthiessen PF.",2007,Biomed Digit Libr,,,,,,,,10.1186/1742-5581-4-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17407592,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uses open dataset BUT not focused on health plus data is about genetic maps of potatos from south america and includes north america and europe,No,"Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are very useful molecular markers for a number of plant species. They are commonly used in cultivar identification, plant variety protection, as anchor markers in genetic mapping, and in marker-assisted breeding. Early development of SSRs was hampered by the high cost of library screening and clone sequencing. Currently, large public SSR datasets exist for many crop species, but the number of publicly available, mapped SSRs for potato is relatively low (~100). We have utilized a database mining approach to identify SSR-containing sequences in The Institute For Genomic Research Potato Gene Index database (http://www.tigr.org), focusing on sequences with size polymorphisms present in this dataset. Ninety-four primer pairs flanking SSR sequences were synthesized and used to amplify potato DNA. This study rendered 61 useful SSRs that were located in pre-existing genetic maps, fingerprinted in a set of 30 cultivars from South America, North America, and Europe or a combination thereof. The high proportion of success (65%) of expressed sequence tag-derived SSRs obtained in this work validates the use of transcribed sequences as a source of markers. These markers will be useful for genetic mapping, taxonomic studies, marker-assisted selection, and cultivar identification.",Mapping and characterization of new EST-derived microsatellites for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.),"Feingold S, Lloyd J, Norero N, Bonierbale M, Lorenzen J.",2005,Theor Appl Genet,,,,,,,,10.1007/s00122-005-2028-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15942755,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"Background: Long travel times to reach essential surgical care in Chiapas, Mexico’s poorest state, can delay lifesaving procedures and contribute to adverse outcomes. Geographical access to surgical facilities is 1 of the 6 indicators of the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery and has been measured extensively worldwide. Our objective is to determine the population with 2-h geographical access to facilities capable of performing the Bellwether procedures (laparotomy, cesarean delivery, and open fracture repair). This is the first study in Mexico to assess access to surgical facilities, including both the fragmented public sector and the private sector. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, conducted from June 2019 to January 2020, Bellwether capable surgical facilities from all health systems in Chiapas were geocoded and assessed through on-site data collection, Ministry of Health databases, and verified via telephone. Geospatial analyses were performed on Redivis. Results: We identified 59 Bellwether capable hospitals, with 17.5% (n = 954,460) of the state residing more than 2 h from surgical care in public and private health systems. Of those, 22 facilities had confirmed 24/7 Bellwether capability, and 23% (n = 1,178,383) of the affiliated population resided more than 2 h from these hospitals. Conclusions: Our study shows that the Ministry of Health and employment-based health coverage could provide timely access to essential surgical care for the majority of the population. However, the fragmentation of the healthcare system leaves a gap that contributes to delays in care and unmet emergency surgical needs. © 2021, Société Internationale de Chirurgie.","Access to Essential Surgical Care in Chiapas, Mexico: A System-Wide Geospatial Analysis","Carrillo-Villasenor F., Fowler Z., Moeller E., Roa L., Macias V., Koch R., Mohar S., Caddell L., Cervantes S., Mathews I., Riviello R., Cervantes-Trejo A., Meara J.G., Uribe-Leitz T.",2021,World Journal of Surgery,45,6,,1663,1671,8.0,5.0,10.1007/s00268-021-05975-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104904741&doi=10.1007%2fs00268-021-05975-y&partnerID=40&md5=2e43b7345ad87e949b8926bcf87a64e6,"Compañeros en Salud, Jaltenango, CHIS, Mexico; Ciencias de la Salud y Escuela de Medicina, Tecnológico de Monterrey, 2514 Av.

,,"Objectives: Evaluation of hypernasality requires extensive perceptual training by clinicians and extending this training on a large scale internationally is untenable; this compounds the health disparities that already exist among children with cleft. In this work, we present the objective hypernasality measure (OHM), a speech-based algorithm that automatically measures hypernasality in speech, and validate it relative to a group of trained clinicians. Methods: We trained a deep neural network (DNN) on approximately 100 hours of a publicly-available healthy speech corpus to detect the presence of nasal acoustic cues generated through the production of nasal consonants and nasalized phonemes in speech. Importantly, this model does not require any clinical data for training. The posterior probabilities of the deep learning model were aggregated at the sentence and speaker-levels to compute the OHM. Results: The results showed that the OHM was significantly correlated with perceptual hypernasality ratings from the Americleft database (r = 0.797, p < 0.001) and the New Mexico Cleft Palate Center (NMCPC) database (r = 0.713, p < 0.001). In addition, we evaluated the relationship between the OHM and articulation errors; the sensitivity of the OHM in detecting the presence of very mild hypernasality; and established the internal reliability of the metric. Further, the performance of the OHM was compared with a DNN regression algorithm directly trained on the hypernasal speech samples.

This work yielded 11,979 verbal autopsy interviews (VAIs). In each, a field interviewer spoke with an individual familiar with the deceased and their final illness, and used a semi-structured questionnaire to collect information about the symptoms of the deceased in their final illness. The VAI collected demographic characteristics, possible risk factors (such as tobacco use), and other potentially contributing characteristics. It also included the open-ended question, “Could you please summarize, or tell us in your own words, any additional information about the illness and/or death of your loved one?” (open narrative). The VAI data were released in a de-identified format in September 2013 through the Global Health Data Exchange, in files that contain verbal autopsies that were collected at six sites in four countries (India, Mexico, Tanzania, and the Philippines). Due to research interest, we have now created redacted versions of the open narratives from the open-ended question of the questionnaire. We hope that this database will be the source of innovations that increase our knowledge about the causes of ill health and, through this knowledge, produce improvements in health for individuals and populations. © 2018 Flaxman AD et al.","A de-identified database of 11,979 verbal autopsy open-ended responses","Flaxman A.D., Harman L., Joseph J., Brown J., Murray C.J.L.",2018,Gates Open Research,2,,18,,,,1.0,10.12688/gatesopenres.12812.1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073362633&doi=10.12688%2fgatesopenres.12812.1&partnerID=40&md5=e866d6561aec0ed9c49ce5468ae01286,"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, 98121, WA, United States","Flaxman A.D., Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, 98121, WA, United States; Harman L., Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, 98121, WA, United States; Joseph J., Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, 98121, WA, United States; Brown J., Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, 98121, WA, United States; Murray C.J.L., Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, 98121, WA, United States",Cause of death; Natural language processing; Open data; Verbal autopsy,,Cause of death;Natural language processing;Open data;Verbal autopsy,"A.D.

,,"Soldiers in active military service need optimal physical fitness for successfully carrying out their operations. Therefore, their health status is regularly checked by army doctors. These inspections include physical parameters such as the body-mass index (BMI), functional tests, and biochemical studies. If a medical exam reveals an individual's excess weight, further examinations are made, and corrective actions for weight lowering are initiated. The collection of urine is non-invasive and therefore attractive for frequent metabolic screening. We compared the chemical profiles of urinary samples of 146 normal weight, excess weight, and obese soldiers of the Mexican Army, using untargeted metabolomics with liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In combination with data mining, statistical and metabolic pathway analyses suggest increased S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) levels and changes of amino acid metabolites as important variables for overfeeding. We will use these potential biomarkers for the ongoing metabolic monitoring of soldiers in active service. In addition, after validation of our results, we will develop biochemical screening tests that are also suitable for civil applications.",A diagnostic model for overweight and obesity from untargeted urine metabolomics of soldiers,"Albores-Mendez, E.M., Hernandez, A.D.A., Melo-Gonzalez, A., Vargas-Hernandez, M.A., de la Cruz, N.G., Vazquez-Guzman, M.A., Castro-Marin, M., Romero-Morelos, P., Winkler, R.",2022,PEERJ,10,,e13754,,,23.0,0.0,10.7717/peerj.13754,,"[Albores-Mendez, Exsal M.; Aguilera Hernandez, Alexis D.; Melo-Gonzalez, Alejandra; Vargas-Hernandez, Marco A.; Gutierrez de la Cruz, Neptali; Vazquez-Guzman, Miguel A.; Castro-Marin, Melchor; Romero-Morelos, Pablo] Univ Ejercito & Fuerza Aerea Mexicanos, Secretaria Def Nacl, Escuela Mil Graduados Sanidad, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Vazquez-Guzman, Miguel A.] Univ Anahuac Mexico, Ctr Invest Ciencias Salud CICSA, FCS, Campus Norte, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Romero-Morelos, Pablo] Univ Estatal Valle Ecatepec, Ecatepec, Mexico; [Winkler, Robert] CINVESTAV, UGA Langebio, Irapuato, Gto, Mexico; [Winkler, Robert] CINVESTAV, Biotechnol & Biochem, Unidad Irapuato, Irapuato, Gto, Mexico",,Metabolic status; Metabolomics; Military service; Soldiers; Public health; Obesity; Data mining,OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE; HOMOCYSTEINE; PLATFORM; METABOLISM; KNOWLEDGE; DATABASE; OPENMS; RATTLE,Metabolic status;Metabolomics;Military service;Soldiers;Public health;Obesity;Data mining;OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE;HOMOCYSTEINE;PLATFORM;METABOLISM;KNOWLEDGE;DATABASE;OPENMS;RATTLE,robert.winkler@cinvestav.mx,,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",,,,PEERJ INC,2167-8359,,,35898940.0,English,PEERJ,Article,WoS,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000838716800002,,Mexico,cinvestav.mx,Univ Ejercito & Fuerza Aerea Mexicanos;Univ Anahuac Mexico;Univ Estatal Valle Ecatepec;CINVESTAV,"Univ Ejercito & Fuerza Aerea Mexicanos, Mexico;Univ Anahuac Mexico, Mexico;Univ Estatal Valle Ecatepec, Mexico;CINVESTAV, Mexico","Albores-Mendez, Exsal M.; Aguilera Hernandez, Alexis D.; Melo-Gonzalez, Alejandra; Vargas-Hernandez, Marco A.; Gutierrez de la Cruz, Neptali; Vazquez-Guzman, Miguel A.; Castro-Marin, Melchor; Romero-Morelos, Pablo; Winkler, Robert",15.0,
,,"The protection of pedestrians, cyclists, and public transportation passengers from environmental pollution is a global concern. This study fills the gap in the existing knowledge of temporal exposure to air pollution in Latin American metropolises. The paper proposes a methodology ad-dressing the relationship between two objects of study, i.e., the users of active modes of transport and air quality. This new methodology assesses the spatiotemporal concurrence of both objects with statistical analysis of large open-access databases, to promote healthy and sustainable urban mobility. The application of the empirical methodology estimated the number of users of active transportation modes exposed to poor air quality episodes in the Guadalajara metropolitan area (Mexico) in 2019. The study considered two pollutants, ozone (O3 ) and particulate matter (PM10 ), and two active modes, cycling and bus rapid transit (BRT). Spatiotemporal analyses were carried out with geographic information systems, as well as with numeric computing platforms. First, big data were used to count the number of users for each mode within the area of influence of the air quality monitoring stations. Second, the number of air pollution episodes was obtained using the air quality index proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (USA) on an hourly basis. Third, the spatiotemporal concurrence between air quality episodes and active mode users was calculated. In particular, the air quality monitoring data from the Jalisco Atmospheric Monitoring System were compared to users of the public bicycle share system, known as MiBici, and of a bus rapid transit line, known as Mi Macro Calzada. The results showed that the number of cyclists and BRT passengers exposed to poor air quality episodes was considerable in absolute terms, that is, 208,660 users, while it was marginal when compared to the total number of users exposed to better air quality categories in the study area, who represented only 10%. To apply the results at the metropolitan scale, the spatial distribution of the air quality monitoring system should be improved, as well as the availability of data on pedestrians and conventional bus passengers. © 2021 by the authors.

Some actions are being implemented at the hospital level to eliminate the use of mercury thermometers in some cities. This study evaluated the impact of policy alternatives for the sound management of mercury released from used thermometers using a life cycle assessment with Umberto software and Ecoinvent databases. The results identified that the elimination of open dumping and increasing the recycling rate of mercury up to 60% will lead to the highest net benefits compared with the use of virgin materials in new products. This study showed different scenarios of recycling and end of life practices in the management of mercury waste from glass thermometers in Mexico to know the environmental burdens of each treatment strategy and identified recommendations for development of public policies for handling of this type of waste with focus in the decrease of associated risks. It was demonstrated that increase of recycling allows reducing the environmental impacts caused by the use of raw materials and that decrease of landfills for deposit of mercury waste, preventing uncontrolled emissions of mercury to the atmosphere. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Alternatives of management and disposal for mercury thermometers at the end of their life from Mexican health care institutions,"Gavilan-Garcia I.C., Fernandez-Villagomez G., Gavilan-Garcia A., Alcantara-Concepcion V.",2015,Journal of Cleaner Production,86,,,118,124,6.0,16.0,10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.08.013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027956457&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2014.08.013&partnerID=40&md5=21f1434a9c8f084af7b083d8aed008a5,"Facultad de Química, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Av.

Our objective is to improve the hospital’s capacity to establish a budget for its operation, to comply with the federal government’s request to operate free of charge for users. To achieve the objective the authors constructed a computerized costs system, using software resources owned by the institute, based on TDABC methodology (Time Driven Activity Costing methodology), which generates and allocates expenditures depending on the execution time of a process. Likewise, the use of fuzzy logic tools helps decreasing inherent uncertainty bring by the resources consume, typical of clinical processes. It was collected information related to medical supplies, human resources, equipment, and infrastructure expenditures. This work describes the approach and execution of a pilot test made in nine clinical areas of the hospital.

Evaluating the severity of this contingency is possible if the hospital fatality rate of COVID-19 is described because hospitalized patients present more severe conditions. To analyze the fatality of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. A quantitative, descriptive, analytical, cross-sectional, and retrospective study was conducted using open database from Ministry of Health in Mexico. The analysis included 71,189 discharges from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Mexican Ministry of Health Hospitals during 2020. Of them, 27,403 were due to death, predominantly in men and age groups from 50 to 69 years. The general hospital fatality due to COVID-19 was 38.49%, a hospital fatality of 40.75% in men and 35.03% in women. The 55-to-99-year-old age groups, Baja California, Puebla, and Coahuila had a higher hospital fatality than the general fatality. Besides the deaths caused directly by COVID-19 (those that occurred due to respiratory failures), many deaths were indirect in persons with comorbidities exacerbated by this disease. Access to health services, social changes derived from job loss, home protection, and changes in social dynamics, facts expressed in the general mortality excess, cannot be quantified in our study.

,,"Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the long-term survival of open versus thoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy for early stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Background: Data from national studies on long-term survival for VATS versus open lobectomy are limited. Methods: Outcomes of patients who underwent open versus VATS lobectomy for clinical T1-2, N0, M0 NSCLC in the National Cancer Data Base were evaluated using propensity score matching. Results: The median follow-up of 7114 lobectomies (5566 open and 1548 VATS) was 52.0 months. The VATS approach was associated with a better 5-year survival when compared to the open approach (66.0% vs. 62.5%, P = 0.026). Propensity score matching resulted in 1464 open and 1464 VATS patients who were well matched by 14 common prognostic covariates including tumor size and comorbidities. After propensity score matching, the VATS approach was associated with a shorter median length of stay (5 vs. 6 days, P < 0.001). The VATS approach was not significantly different compared with the open approach with regard to nodal upstaging (11.6% vs 12.3%, P = 0.53), 30-day mortality (1.7% vs 2.3%, P = 0.50) and 5-year survival (66.3% vs 65.8%, P = 0.92). Conclusions: In this national analysis, VATS lobectomy was used in the minority of patients with stage I NSCLC. VATS lobectomy was associated with shorter length of stay and noninferior long-term survival when compared with open lobectomy. These results support previous findings from smaller single- and multi-institutional studies that suggest that VATS does not compromise oncologic outcomes when used for early-stage lung cancer and suggest the need for broader implementation of VATS techniques.

,,"Objective: Open research on fetal heart rate (FHR) estimation is relatively rare, and evidence for the utility of metrics derived from Doppler ultrasound devices has historically remained hidden in the proprietary documentation of commercial entities, thereby inhibiting its assessment and improvement. Nevertheless, recent studies have attempted to improve FHR estimation; however, these methods were developed and tested using datasets composed of few subjects and are therefore unlikely to be generalizable on a population level. The work presented here introduces a reproducible and generalizable autocorrelation (AC)-based method for FHR estimation from one-dimensional Doppler ultrasound (1D-DUS) signals. Approach: Simultaneous fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) and 1D-DUS signals generated by a hand-held Doppler transducer in a fixed position were captured by trained healthcare workers in a European hospital. The fECG QRS complexes were identified using a previously published fECG extraction algorithm and were then over-read to ensure accuracy. An AC-based method to estimate FHR was then developed on this data, using a total of 721 1D-DUS segments, each 3.75 s long, and parameters were tuned with Bayesian optimization. The trained FHR estimator was tested on two additional (independent) hand-annotated Doppler-only datasets recorded with the same device but on different populations: one composed of 3938 segments (from 99 fetuses) acquired in rural Guatemala, and another composed of 894 segments (from 17 fetuses) recorded in a hospital in the UK. Main results: The proposed AC-based method was able to estimate FHR within 10% of the reference FHR values 96% of the time, with an accuracy of 97% for manually identified good quality segments in both of the independent test sets. Significance: This is the first work to publish open source code for FHR estimation from 1D-DUS data. The method was shown to satisfy estimations within 10% of the reference FHR values and it therefore defines a minimum accuracy for the field to match or surpass. Our work establishes a basis from which future methods can be developed to more accurately estimate FHR variability for assessing fetal wellbeing from 1D-DUS signals. © 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",An open source autocorrelation-based method for fetal heart rate estimation from one-dimensional Doppler ultrasound,"Valderrama C.E., Stroux L., Katebi N., Paljug E., Hall-Clifford R., Rohloff P., Marzbanrad F., Clifford G.D.",2019,Physiological Measurement,40,2,025005,,,,14.0,10.1088/1361-6579/ab033d,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064076827&doi=10.1088%2f1361-6579%2fab033d&partnerID=40&md5=44c45127f2c1509b4a956e1f910d43c6,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States; Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Departments of Sociology and Anthropology, And Public Health, Agnes Scott College, Decatur, GA, United States; Division of Global Health Equity, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States; Wuqu' Kawoq-Maya Health Alliance, Santiago Sacatepéquez, Guatemala; Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia","Valderrama C.E., Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States; Stroux L., Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; Katebi N., Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States; Paljug E., Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Hall-Clifford R., Departments of Sociology and Anthropology, And Public Health, Agnes Scott College, Decatur, GA, United States; Rohloff P., Division of Global Health Equity, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States, Wuqu' Kawoq-Maya Health Alliance, Santiago Sacatepéquez, Guatemala; Marzbanrad F., Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia; Clifford G.D., Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States",autocorrelation function; fetal heart rate; fetal monitoring; one-dimensional Doppler ultrasound; signal processing,"Benchmarking; Electrocardiography; Fetal Monitoring; Heart Rate, Fetal; Humans; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Software; Ultrasonography, Doppler; Autocorrelation; Fetal monitoring; Heart; Hospitals; Neonatal monitoring; Non Newtonian flow; Open source software; Ultrasonic imaging; Ultrasonics; Auto correlation; Autocorrelation functions; Doppler; Doppler ultrasound; Fetal electrocardiograms; Foetal heart rates; One-dimensional; One-dimensional dopple ultrasound; Rate estimation; Signal-processing; benchmarking; Doppler ultrasonography; electrocardiography; fetus heart rate; fetus monitoring; human; procedures; signal processing; software; Open systems","autocorrelation function;fetal heart rate;fetal monitoring;one-dimensional Doppler ultrasound;signal processing;Benchmarking;Electrocardiography;Heart Rate, Fetal;Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Software;Ultrasonography, Doppler;Autocorrelation;Heart;Hospitals;Neonatal monitoring;Non Newtonian flow;Open source software;Ultrasonic imaging;Ultrasonics;Auto correlation;Autocorrelation functions;Doppler;Doppler ultrasound;Fetal electrocardiograms;Foetal heart rates;One-dimensional;One-dimensional dopple ultrasound;Rate estimation;Signal-processing;Doppler ultrasonography;fetus heart rate;fetus monitoring;human;procedures;Open systems",,,,,,,IOP Publishing Ltd,09673334,,PMEAE,30699403.0,English,Physiol.

,,"The Tomographic Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEGt) toolbox is integrated with the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Neuroinformatics Ecosystem as a docker into the Canadian Brain Imaging Research Platform (CBRAIN). qEEGt produces age-corrected normative Statistical Parametric Maps of EEG log source spectra testing compliance to a normative database. This toolbox was developed at the Cuban Neuroscience Center as part of the first wave of the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project (CHBMP) and has been validated and used in different health systems for several decades. Incorporation into the MNI ecosystem now provides CBRAIN registered users access to its full functionality and is accompanied by a public release of the source code on GitHub and Zenodo repositories. Among other features are the calculation of EEG scalp spectra, and the estimation of their source spectra using the Variable Resolution Electrical Tomography (VARETA) source imaging. Crucially, this is completed by the evaluation of z spectra by means of the built-in age regression equations obtained from the CHBMP database (ages 5-87) to provide normative Statistical Parametric Mapping of EEG log source spectra. Different scalp and source visualization tools are also provided for evaluation of individual subjects prior to further post-processing. Openly releasing this software in the CBRAIN platform will facilitate the use of standardized qEEGt methods in different research and clinical settings. An updated precis of the methods is provided inAppendix Ias a reference for the toolbox. qEEGt/CBRAIN is the first installment of instruments developed by the neuroinformatic platform of the Cuba-Canada-China (CCC) project.",A Quantitative EEG Toolbox for the MNI Neuroinformatics Ecosystem: Normative SPM of EEG Source Spectra,"Bosch-Bayard, J., Aubert-Vazquez, E., Brown, S.T., Rogers, C., Kiar, G., Glatard, T., Scaria, L., Galan-Garcia, L., Bringas-Vega, M.L., Virues-Alba, T., Taheri, A., Das, S., Madjar, C., Mohaddes, Z., MacIntyre, L., Evans, A.C., Valdes-Sosa, P.A.",2020,FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS,14,,33,,,11.0,10.0,10.3389/fninf.2020.00033,,"[Bosch-Bayard, Jorge; Valdes-Sosa, Pedro A.] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China UESTC, Clin Hosp, Chengdu Brain Sci Inst, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Bosch-Bayard, Jorge; Brown, Shawn T.; Rogers, Christine; Kiar, Gregory; Glatard, Tristan; Scaria, Lalet; Bringas-Vega, Maria L.; Taheri, Armin; Das, Samir; Madjar, Cecile; Mohaddes, Zia; MacIntyre, Leigh; Evans, Alan C.; Valdes-Sosa, Pedro A.] McGill Univ, McGill Ctr Integrat Neurosci MCIN, Ludmer Ctr Neuroinformat & Mental Hlth, Montreal Neurol Inst MNI, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bosch-Bayard, Jorge; Aubert-Vazquez, Eduardo; Galan-Garcia, Lidice; Bringas-Vega, Maria L.; Virues-Alba, Trinidad; Valdes-Sosa, Pedro A.; CHBMP] Cuban Neurosci Ctr, Havana, Cuba",,Statistical Parametric Mapping; qEEGt; CBRAIN; EEG tomography; quantitative EEG; open science,,Statistical Parametric Mapping;qEEGt;CBRAIN;EEG tomography;quantitative EEG;open science,alan@bic.mni.mcgill.ca; pedro.valdes@neuroinformatics-collaboratory.org,,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,,,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,,,,32848689.0,English,FRONT NEUROINFORM,Article,WoS,Mathematical & Computational Biology; Neurosciences & Neurology,WOS:000563218900001,2-s2.0-85089910560,China;Canada;Cuba,bic.mni.mcgill.ca,Univ Elect Sci & Technol China UESTC;McGill Univ;Cuban Neurosci Ctr,"Univ Elect Sci & Technol China UESTC, China;McGill Univ, Canada;Cuban Neurosci Ctr, Cuba","Bosch-Bayard, Jorge; Aubert-Vazquez, Eduardo; Brown, Shawn T.; Rogers, Christine; Kiar, Gregory; Glatard, Tristan; Scaria, Lalet; Galan-Garcia, Lidice; Bringas-Vega, Maria L.; Virues-Alba, Trinidad; Taheri, Armin; Das, Samir; Madjar, Cecile; Mohaddes, Zia; MacIntyre, Leigh; Evans, Alan C.; Valdes-Sosa, Pedro A.",37.0,

,,"Acute respiratory infections have been established as the principal cause of disease in the Mexican population from 2000 to 2018; however, even when these diseases may aggravate asthma, there is a lack of epidemiologic evidence on the health outcomes when both conditions coexist. Learning about the asthma hospitalizations trends will help us identify monthly variation of hospitalizations, vulnerable groups, needed services, and improvements in therapeutics and prevention. This study aims to analyze the variation in asthma hospitalizations and mortality during the 2010–2018 period in Mexico. Data were obtained from the General Board of Health Information (DGIS) Open Access datasets, which were analyzed taking hospital discharges and hospital deaths recorded from 2010 to 2018 from all public hospitals nationwide. The binomial logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between patient ages, hospitalization month, and mortality. The death rate from asthma in Mexico decreased between 2010 and 2018. Still, the hospital mortality rate shows recent improvement; however, prognosis of hospitalized patients depends on their age, accurate diagnosis, length of hospital stay and occurrence of nosocomial infection. © 2020 by the authors.

,,"Sargassum algal blooms on ocean surfaces and landings of huge Sargassum mats on beaches is an emerging global environmental challenge with wide socio-economic and environmental implications. Literature on Sargassum growth cycles, travel patterns, species and morphotypes, and quantified impacts have tended to focus on a geographic region, or a specific event. Few, if any, publications document long term continuous monitoring of Sargassum blooms in large areas such as the Pacific, or the tropical Atlantic. To address this gap, this paper systematically reviews the global evidence of Sargassum bloom monitoring beyond the Sargasso Sea, and identifies gaps in the evidence base of floating and landing influxes. This systematic review uses combinations of two key terms relating to Sargassum and monitoring, and utilises the resources in ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus and Google Scholar. The analysis moves us past a classic literature review, and produces an unbiased assessment of empirical research on Sargassum monitoring from 1960 to 2019. We find a significant research focus on open-ocean blooms and floating mats whereas research on beach landings and their associated impacts is comparatively limited. Research is focused within specific countries or water bodies (notably, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean and North Atlantic Ocean) and tends not to comprehensively assess neighbouring or regional shorelines, for example, West Africa and Central America. There was a lack of consistency in the application of methods for quantifying Sargassum biomass volume (including dry/wet weight, unit of measurement, and spatial extent of calculations). Further, in many publications Sargassum species identification was omitted. Given current attempts to understand the drivers and impacts of the exponential growth in Sargassum in some parts of the world, a consistent and replicable research approach to monitoring Sargassum could support creation of a Sargassum evidence database. To move this agenda forwards, we propose a definition for a Sargassum ‘event’: a continuous bloom of any Sargassum in open oceans, or, an aggregation of landed Sargassum, with the potential to disrupt social, economic or ecosystem functioning, or to impact human health. This review highlights the importance of standardising Sargassum monitoring methods to facilitate improved documentation of temporal and spatial patterns of Sargassum blooms and beach landings. © 2020 The Author(s).

,,"Objective – Libraries have had to temporarily shut their doors because of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the provision of online and remote services. This review analyzed services offered by libraries, the technological tools used, and the challenges facing libraries during the pandemic. Methods – This study employed a systematic literature review, following the PRISMA checklist (Moher at al., 2009). The Building Blocks search strategy was employed to search for keywords of concepts in Library and Information Science Abstract (LISA), Library and Information Science Technology Abstract (LISTA), Library Science Database, Web of Science (WoS) core collections, and Google Scholar. A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria was pre-determined by the authors prior to database searching. Quality assessment of included studies was performed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (Hong et al., 2018). A tabular approach was used to provide a summary of each article allowing the synthesis of results, which led to the identification of eight broad categories of services provided by libraries in included studies. Results – The first set of searches from the 5 databases produced 3,499 results. After we removed duplicates and applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria based on titles and abstracts, 37 potentially relevant articles were identified. Further screening of the full-text led to the final inclusion of 23 articles used for the qualitative synthesis. The majority of the studies were conducted in the United States of America (n= 6, 26.1%), followed by India (n=4, 17%), and China (n=2, 8.7%). The remaining studies were carried out in United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Mexico, Romania, Czech Republic, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Lesotho, and Zimbabwe. The most common method used in selected studies was the case study (n= 11, 48%), followed by survey (n=7, 30.4%), content analysis (n=4, 17.4%), and mixed methods (n=1, 4.3%). The majority of the studies were carried out in academic libraries (74%), while the rest were based on medical, public, and special libraries. Findings show that the majority of academic libraries in the included studies are providing and expanding access to electronic resources (n=16, 69.6%) and increasing open access resources and services (n=11, 47.8%). More so, most academic libraries are assisting in virtual education and teaching endeavors of faculty and students (n=13, 56.5%). In addition, some medical and public libraries are bolstering public health safety through health literacy (n=12, 52.2%), supporting research efforts, and engaging in virtual reference services, among others. In order to carry out these services, libraries are harnessing several educational, social networking, communication, and makerspaces technologies. Most of the libraries in the included studies reported budgetary challenges, and the need for new ICT infrastructure and Internet service as they move their services online. Conclusion – This review found that libraries are adapting in a number of ways to continue their roles in meeting patrons’ needs in spite of the growing challenges posed by COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown. For libraries to thrive in these trying times, there must be a well-structured approach to ensuring continuity of services. Libraries should prioritize the acquisition of electronic resources as well as increase their efforts to digitize resources that are only available in printed copies. As library services have predominantly shifted online, there should be concerted effort and support from government and funding agencies to equip libraries with the technological facilities needed to provide cutting-edge services. The quality assessment of the included studies shows that there is need for rigor and transparency in the methodological description of studies investigating library services provision in a pandemic. This review provides an overview of the ways libraries have responded to the challenges posed by a global pandemic, and hence will be of use and interest to all librarians especially those in health and academic sectors. © 2021 Ayeni, Agbaje, and Tippler.

,,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in multiple ways and has been a challenge for the health systems of each country. From the beginning, risk factors for the severity and mortality of the disease were considered, as the spread of the virus was related to the living conditions of each population. Methods: In this ecological study we have evaluated the role of geography, precisely the altitude above sea level in the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in Peru. Incidence and mortality data were taken from the open-access database of the government of Peru until March 2021. COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 mortality were treated as cases/density population and 1000 x cases/inhabitants while altitude was treated as continuous and as a categorical variable divided in 7 categories. The relationship between COVID-19 cases or deaths for COVID-19 and altitude as continuous variable was determined using Spearman correlation test. Meanwhile when altitude was considered as a categorical variable, Poisson regression or negative binomial analyses were applied. Results: A significant inverse correlation was found between COVID-19 cases by population density and altitude (r=-0.37 p < 0.001). By altitude categories, the lowest risk for infection was observed between 3,000 and 3,500 m (IRR 0.08; 95% CI 0.05,0.12). Moreover, we found an inverse correlation between altitude and COVID-19 mortality (r=-0.39 p < 0.001). Also, the lowest risk for mortality was observed between 3,000 and 3,500 m (IRR 0.12; 95%CI 0.08; 0.18). Similar results were found when analyses were adjusted for inhabitants and stratified by sex. Conclusion: This study reports an inverse relationship between COVID-19 incidence and mortality with respect to the altitude of residence, particularly, a u-shaped protection is shown, with a highest benefit between 3000 and 3500 m. The possibility of using hypoxia as an alternative treatment requires more complex studies that should allow knowing the physiological and environmental mechanisms of the protective role. © 2023, The Author(s).",A U-shaped protection of altitude against mortality and infection of COVID-19 in Peru: an ecological study,"Baquerizo-Sedano L., Goni L., Sayon-Orea C., Gonzalez-Muniesa P.",2023,BMC Public Health,23,1,1054,,,,0.0,10.1186/s12889-023-15537-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160905452&doi=10.1186%2fs12889-023-15537-7&partnerID=40&md5=4e54b9c8af6383fa8b662c960614e289,"Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru; Faculty of Pharmacy and Nutrition, Department of Food Sciences and Physiology, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; Center for Nutrition Research, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; IDISNA – Navarra Institute for Health Research, Pamplona, Spain; CIBER Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBERobn), Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain; Navarra Public Health Institute, Pamplona, Spain","Baquerizo-Sedano L., Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru, Faculty of Pharmacy and Nutrition, Department of Food Sciences and Physiology, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain, Center for Nutrition Research, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; Goni L., Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain, IDISNA – Navarra Institute for Health Research, Pamplona, Spain, CIBER Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBERobn), Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain; Sayón-Orea C., Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain, IDISNA – Navarra Institute for Health Research, Pamplona, Spain, CIBER Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBERobn), Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain, Navarra Public Health Institute, Pamplona, Spain; González-Muniesa P., Faculty of Pharmacy and Nutrition, Department of Food Sciences and Physiology, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain, Center for Nutrition Research, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain, IDISNA – Navarra Institute for Health Research, Pamplona, Spain, CIBER Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBERobn), Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain",Altitude; COVID-19; Hypoxia; Risk factor,,Altitude;COVID-19;Hypoxia;Risk factor,"P.

,,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between body mass index (BMI, kg m(-2)) and mortality rate among Hispanic adults. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Analysis of five data sets (total N = 16 798) identified after searching for publicly available, prospective cohort data sets containing relevant information for at least 500 Hispanic respondents (>= 18 years at baseline), at least 5 years of mortality follow-up, and measured height and weight. Data sets included the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the Puerto Rico Heart Health Program (PRHHP), the Hispanic Established Population for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (HEPESE), the San Antonio Heart Study (SAHS) and the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging. RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusting for sex and smoking, were fit within three attained-age strata (18 to younger than 60 years, 60 to younger than 70 years, and 70 years and older). We found that underweight was associated with elevated mortality rate for all age groups in the PRHHP (hazard ratios [HRs] = 1.38-1.60) and the SAHS (HRs = 1.88-2.51). Overweight (HRs = 0.38 and 0.84) and obesity grade 2-3 (HRs = 0.75 and 0.60) associated with reduced mortality rate in the HEPESE dataset for those in the 60 to younger than 70 years, and 70 years and older attained-age strata. Weighted estimates combining the HRs across the data sets revealed a similar pattern. CONCLUSION: Among Hispanic adults, there was no clear evidence that overweight and obesity associate with elevated mortality rate.",Body mass index and mortality rate among Hispanic adults: a pooled analysis of multiple epidemiologic data sets,"Fontaine, K.R., McCubrey, R., Mehta, T., Pajewski, N.M., Keith, S.W., Bangalore, S.S., Crespo, C.J., Allison, D.B.",2012,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY,36,8,,1121,1126,6.0,24.0,10.1038/ijo.2011.194,,"[Fontaine, K.

,,"Background: Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which affects approx. 12 million individuals worldwide and caused by parasite Leishmania. The current drugs used in the treatment of Leishmaniasis are highly toxic and has seen widespread emergence of drug resistant strains which necessitates the need for the development of new therapeutic options. The high throughput screen data available has made it possible to generate computational predictive models which have the ability to assess the active scaffolds in a chemical library followed by its ADME/toxicity properties in the biological trials. Results: In the present study, we have used publicly available, high-throughput screen datasets of chemical moieties which have been adjudged to target the pyruvate kinase enzyme of L. mexicana (LmPK). The machine learning approach was used to create computational models capable of predicting the biological activity of novel antileishmanial compounds. Further, we evaluated the molecules using the substructure based approach to identify the common substructures contributing to their activity. Conclusion: We generated computational models based on machine learning methods and evaluated the performance of these models based on various statistical figures of merit. Random forest based approach was determined to be the most sensitive, better accuracy as well as ROC. We further added a substructure based approach to analyze the molecules to identify potentially enriched substructures in the active dataset. We believe that the models developed in the present study would lead to reduction in cost and length of clinical studies and hence newer drugs would appear faster in the market providing better healthcare options to the patients.",Cheminformatic models based on machine learning for pyruvate kinase inhibitors of Leishmania mexicana,"Jamal, S., Scaria, V.",2013,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,14,,329,,,7.0,26.0,10.1186/1471-2105-14-329,,"[Jamal, Salma] CSIR Open Source Drug Discovery Unit, New Delhi 110001, India; [Scaria, Vinod] CSIR Inst Genom & Integrat Biol, GN Ramachandran Knowledge Ctr Genome Informat, Delhi 110007, India",,,EPIDEMIOLOGY; DISEASES,EPIDEMIOLOGY;DISEASES,vinods@igib.in,,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,,,BMC,1471-2105,,,24252103.0,English,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,Article,WoS,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,WOS:000327531700001,,India,igib.in,CSIR Open Source Drug Discovery Unit;CSIR Inst Genom & Integrat Biol,"CSIR Open Source Drug Discovery Unit, India;CSIR Inst Genom & Integrat Biol, India","Jamal, Salma; Scaria, Vinod",74.0,
,,"Background: Vaccines are highly effective at preventing infectious diseases in children, and prevention is especially important in resource-limited countries where treatment is difficult to access. In Honduras, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports very high immunization rates in children. To determine whether or not these estimates accurately depict the immunization coverage in non-urban regions of the country, we compared the WHO data to immunization rates obtained from a local database tool and community health center records in rural Intibuca, Honduras. Methods: We used data from two sources to comprehensively evaluate immunization rates in the area: 1) census data from a local database and 2) immunization data collected at health centers. We compared these rates using logistic regression, and we compared them to publicly available WHO-reported estimates using confidence interval inclusion. Results: We found that mean immunization rates for each vaccine were high (range 84.4 to 98.8 percent), but rates recorded at the health centers were significantly higher than those reported from the census data (p <= 0.001). Combining the results from both databases, the mean rates of four out of five vaccines were less than WHO-reported rates (p<0.05). Overall immunization rates were significantly different between townships (p= 0.03). The rates by individual vaccine were similar across townships (p> 0.05), except for diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine (p=0.02) and oral polio vaccine (p<0.01). Conclusions: Immunization rates in Honduras were high across data sources, though most of the rates recorded in rural Honduras were less than WHO-reported rates. Despite geographical difficulties and barriers to access, the local database and Honduran community health workers have developed a thorough system for ensuring that children receive their immunizations on time. The successful integration of community health workers and a database within the Honduran decentralized health system may serve as a model for other immunization programs in resource-limited countries where health care is less accessible.","Childhood immunization rates in rural Intibuca, Honduras: an analysis of a local database tool and community health center records for assessing and improving vaccine coverage","He, Y., Zarychta, A., Ranz, J.B., Carroll, M., Singleton, L.M., Wilson, P.M., Schlaudecker, E.P.",2012,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,12,,1056,,,6.0,3.0,10.1186/1471-2458-12-1056,,"[He, Yuan; Zarychta, Alan] Shoulder Shoulder, Concepcion, Intibuca, Honduras; [Ranz, Joseph B.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp & Med Ctr, Global Hlth Ctr, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Carroll, Mary; Singleton, Lori M.; Wilson, Paria M.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp & Med Ctr, Global Hlth Track Pediat Residency Training Prog, Cincinnati, OH USA",,Vaccines; Childhood immunization; Honduras; Database; Community health workers; Public health,,Vaccines;Childhood immunization;Honduras;Database;Community health workers;Public health,Elizabeth.Schlaudecker@cchmc.org,,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",,,,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,1471-2458,,,23216801.0,English,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,Article,WoS,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",WOS:000313442300001,2-s2.0-84870505475,Honduras;United States,cchmc.org,Shoulder Shoulder;Cincinnati Childrens Hosp & Med Ctr,"Shoulder Shoulder, Honduras;Cincinnati Childrens Hosp & Med Ctr, United States","He, Yuan; Zarychta, Alan; Ranz, Joseph B.; Carroll, Mary; Singleton, Lori M.; Wilson, Paria M.; Schlaudecker, Elizabeth P.",75.0,
,,"Child maltreatment is a serious public health problem. Previous research demonstrates that child maltreatment clusters in low-income, racially homogenous neighborhoods. Little is known, however, about the structural correlates of spatial risk in small areas such as census tracts. Here we present additional information regarding the data and methods used in the recent article published in Child Abuse & Neglect entitled ""Variability and stability in child maltreatment risk across time and space and its association with neighborhood social & housing vulnerability in New Mexico: A Bayesian space-time model"" [1] . The present dataset merges child maltreatment data from the New Mexico Department of Public Health with multiple sources of publicly available data to create a novel public health analysis. Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling techniques were used to map the relative risk of substantiated child maltreatment across census tracts in the state, and to elucidate spatial and temporal heterogeneity in risk. The data was initially collected by the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department, the state organization that suspected child abuse and neglect cases are reported to and the organization that then substantiates these cases. The data were then sent to the New Mexico Community Data Collaborative, a data analytic organization under the umbrella of the New Mexico Department of Health. The point file consisting of home addresses of sub stantiated cases of child abuse was then aggregated by census tract, mapped for the entire state of New Mexico and made available to the public for research and analysis by different public health organizations and researchers (including the present researchers). The very purpose of making the data available to the public was to allow deeper investigations into trends and associations with other social determinants of health. This analysis demonstrates the public health importance of data sharing and accessibility. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

,,"Background: We analyzed the demographic, clinical, and diagnostic data of children and adolescents in Mexico, from the first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to 28 February 2022. Methods: Using the open databases of the Ministry of Health and a tertiary pediatric hospital, we obtained demographic and clinical data from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic until 28 February 2022. In addition, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction outputs were used to determine the viral load, and structural protein-based serology was performed to evaluate IgG antibody levels. Results: Of the total 437,832 children and adolescents with COVID-19, 1187 died. Of these patients, 1349 were admitted to the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gómez, and 11 died. Obesity, asthma, and immunosuppression were the main comorbidities, and fever, cough, and headache were the main symptoms. In this population, many patients have a low viral load and IgG antibody levels. Conclusion: During the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, children and adolescents had low incidence and mortality. They are a heterogeneous population, but many patients had comorbidities such as obesity, asthma, and immunosuppression; symptoms such as fever, cough, and headache; and low viral load and IgG antibodies. © 2022 by the authors.",Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Mexican Children and Adolescents,"Flores-Alanis A., Saldana-Ahuactzi Z., Parra-Ortega I., Lopez-Ramirez P., Salazar-Garcia M., Aleman-Garcia Y.P., Cruz-Rangel A., Moreno-Paredes A., Diaz-Rojas A., Maldonado-Bernal C., Quevedo-Moran J., Luna-Pineda V.M.",2022,Viruses,14,10,2162,,,,0.0,10.3390/v14102162,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140796189&doi=10.3390%2fv14102162&partnerID=40&md5=563dffc68dda00d65818b81e6b5451ed,"Departamento de Microbiología y Parasitología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad de México, 04510, Mexico; Paul G.

,,"Background: NEALS is a non-profit organization that aims to successfully promote both research and awareness of ALS, encouraging collaborations among clinicians, researchers, and industry through a commitment to open scientific communication. The efforts of NEALS members are recognized by disease foundations, research groups, and industry, generating critical support through awards and project funding.Objectives: Bringing together a group of distinguished scientists and researchers over the nearly quarter century since its inception, NEALS has developed novel research approaches and recruited a number of new investigators into the field of ALS research in an effort to accelerate ALS clinical trials through academic input and partnership.Methods: The NEALS Consortium adheres to an inclusive policy of adding clinical sites wherever there is interest and expertise, improving access to trials in regions where trial participation was not previously available. NEALS sites include 127 academic ALS trial centers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Lebanon, Italy, Australia and Israel.Education and Participation of the PALS Community in Clinical ResearchAnnual Clinical Research Learning InstitutePALS & CALS as Research AmbassadorsAdvocacy efforts by Research AmbassadorsNEALS website & clinical trial database: http://www. neals.orgResults: The numerous trials run by NEALS-affiliated Principal Investigators and/or Centers is used as a broad benchmark of success for the Consortium. Additionally, the growth of participation in studies by people with ALS has been used as a similar outcome measure when assessing the success of the organization. The research done by NEALS members, paired with the membership's commitment to a coordinated effort, give the NEALS Consortium a unique role, one with top credibility in the community of people with ALS (PALS). The strong relationship between the Consortium's research members and PALS is substantiated by the increasing participation of PALS in the organization's research efforts. Since 1999, 125,286 PALS have participated in NEALS studies. In 2018 alone, 4,173 people with ALS participated in NEALS trials, up significantly from 1999's participation (n=101).Discussion and conclusions: It is more critical than ever for healthcare professionals to underscore the importance of clinical research into the causes and treatments of ALS and associated conditions. In this vision for the future, by involving more people in ALS research and ensuring that they and those around them are properly informed about the disease, public knowledge regarding rare disease research grows, allowing the research community to give back to the patient population through science breakthroughs and increased disease knowledge.",CLT-01 The NEALS Consortium - a collaborative research organization,"Lincoln T.C., Allen C.",2019,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,20,,,262,288,26.0,2.0,10.1080/21678421.2019.1646997,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074726462&doi=10.1080%2f21678421.2019.1646997&partnerID=40&md5=b851a55a265b78a7dd8fe3369f5d18de,"CA, United States; NEALS, Kansas City, MO, USA","Lincoln T.C., CA, United States; Allen C., NEALS, Kansas City, MO, USA",clinical trial; education; research,,clinical trial;education;research,,,,,,,NLM (Medline),21679223,,,31702475.0,English,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,Article,Scopus,,2-s2.0-85074726462,,United States,No email,,,Lincoln T.C.; Allen C.,81.0,

For institutions with low funding, such as the RCT, relying on free or open source mapping systems to estimate travel times is necessary but also error prone because these systems are not tuned for ambulance movements within a city. Therefore, this work formulates a supervised machine learning problem where the goal is to predict the difference in travel time between the ground truth travel time provided by a GPS and the approximation offered by two mapping systems, Google Maps (GM) and Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM). To this end, this work develops a new dataset based on the EMS logs of the RCT, considering calls from January 2017 to April 2017. The posed learning problem is solved under different scenarios, including using an off-the-shelf default configuration of a Random Forest classifier, applying a hyper-parameter optimization process and using an Auto Machine Learning (AutoML) system. Considering all of the dataset for GM, test accuracy was 69.6% for the first two learning approaches and 71.6% using AutoML. For OSRM, performance was 64.6%, 65.2% and 66.4% for each of the learning approaches, respectively. Results show that it is possible to predict the level by which a mapping system over or under estimates the true travel time of an ambulance. Finally, the impact of the model is demonstrated by using it to solve the ambulance location problem, with notable differences in ambulance deployments and percentage of double coverage achieved relative to using the standard mapping system. Results show that without correcting the travel time the percentage of double coverage is 83.90%; on the other hand, double coverage reaches 100% when applying travel time correction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Correction of the travel time estimation for ambulances of the red cross Tijuana using machine learning,"Torres N., Trujillo L., Maldonado Y., Vera C.",2021,Computers in Biology and Medicine,137,,104798,,,,3.0,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104798,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114359978&doi=10.1016%2fj.compbiomed.2021.104798&partnerID=40&md5=e0f1c3c39dae070ba8996d329cb83ca9,"Posgrado en Ciencias de la Ingenieria, Tecnologico Nacional de Mexico/ Instituto Tecnologico de Tijuana, Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico; Universidad Autonoma de Baja California, Tijuana, Baja Califronia, Mexico","Torres N., Posgrado en Ciencias de la Ingenieria, Tecnologico Nacional de Mexico/ Instituto Tecnologico de Tijuana, Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico; Trujillo L., Posgrado en Ciencias de la Ingenieria, Tecnologico Nacional de Mexico/ Instituto Tecnologico de Tijuana, Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico; Maldonado Y., Posgrado en Ciencias de la Ingenieria, Tecnologico Nacional de Mexico/ Instituto Tecnologico de Tijuana, Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico; Vera C., Universidad Autonoma de Baja California, Tijuana, Baja Califronia, Mexico",Ambulance travel time; Emergency medical services; Machine learning; Mapping systems,Ambulances; Emergency Medical Services; Machine Learning; Red Cross; Time Factors; Ambulances; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Emergency services; Mapping; Open systems; Statistical tests; Supervised learning; Ambulance travel time; Emergency medical services; Google maps; Learning approach; Machine-learning; Mapping systems; Open-source; Source routing; Tijuana; Travel-time; ambulance; Article; emergency health service; learning disorder; measurement accuracy; Mexico; process optimization; random forest; Red Cross; supervised machine learning; time perception; travel; emergency health service; machine learning; Red Cross; time factor; Travel time,Ambulance travel time;Emergency medical services;Machine learning;Mapping systems;Ambulances;Red Cross;Time Factors;Classification (of information);Decision trees;Emergency services;Mapping;Open systems;Statistical tests;Supervised learning;Google maps;Learning approach;Machine-learning;Open-source;Source routing;Tijuana;Travel-time;ambulance;Article;emergency health service;learning disorder;measurement accuracy;Mexico;process optimization;random forest;supervised machine learning;time perception;travel;time factor;Travel time,"Y.

,,"Background Immunization preventable bacterial pneumonia is an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) prevention quality indicator of health care. This study explored associations of individual and county correlates with bacterial pneumonia hospitalization rates for elders residing in 32 Texas counties bordering Mexico. Methods We estimated baseline rates from Texas Health Care Information Collection's hospital discharge data for 1999-2001, and population counts from the 2000 U.S. Census. Results The rate among the total Texas border population was 500/10,000, three times the national rate. Elders 75+, males, and Latinos had the highest rates. An increase of 1 primary care physician per 1000 population is associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related hospitalization rates by 33%, while each 10% increase in Latinos is associated with a 0.1% rate increase. Discussion This baseline bacterial pneumonia hospitalization study demonstrates a systematic approach to estimate county rates, a process that could lead to improved outcomes through effective community interventions. Methodology demonstrates how publicly available hospital discharge data can be used by communities to better measure and improve quality of health care. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Correlates of bacterial pneumonia hospitalizations in Elders, Texas border","Lemus F.C., Tan A., Eschbach K., Freeman Jr. D.H., Freeman J.L.",2010,Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health,12,4,,423,432,9.0,3.0,10.1007/s10903-009-9241-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955983844&doi=10.1007%2fs10903-009-9241-z&partnerID=40&md5=1c0799ad7c620fbb4a0c531271c1e7f5,"Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, Sealy Center on Aging, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-1153, United States; Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-1148, United States; Department of Demography and Organizational Studies, Institute for Demographic and Socioeconomic Research, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78249-0704, United States; Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, Office of Biostatistics, Division of Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-1148, United States; Departments of Preventive Medicine and Community Health and Internal Medicine, Sealy Center on Aging, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-0460, United States","Lemus F.C., Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, Sealy Center on Aging, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-1153, United States; Tan A., Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-1148, United States; Eschbach K., Department of Demography and Organizational Studies, Institute for Demographic and Socioeconomic Research, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78249-0704, United States; Freeman Jr. D.H., Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, Office of Biostatistics, Division of Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-1148, United States; Freeman J.L., Departments of Preventive Medicine and Community Health and Internal Medicine, Sealy Center on Aging, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-0460, United States",Bacterial pneumonia hospitalizations; Community Based Participatory Research; Elderly; Health Services Research; Prevention quality indicators; Racial disparities; Residence characteristics; Texas-Mexico border,"Aged; Databases, Factual; Female; Hispanic Americans; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Pneumonia, Bacterial; Preventive Medicine; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Texas; aged; article; bacterial pneumonia; ethnology; factual database; female; health care quality; Hispanic; hospitalization; human; male; preventive medicine; standard; United States","Bacterial pneumonia hospitalizations;Community Based Participatory Research;Elderly;Health Services Research;Prevention quality indicators;Racial disparities;Residence characteristics;Texas-Mexico border;Aged;Databases, Factual;Female;Hispanic Americans;Hospitalization;Humans;Male;Pneumonia, Bacterial;Preventive Medicine;Quality Indicators, Health Care;Texas;article;bacterial pneumonia;ethnology;factual database;health care quality;Hispanic;human;standard;United States","F.

,,"Background: The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 have become a global health crisis. The infection has been present in all the social sectors. Subjects under 18 years are one of them. The objective was to analyze the case fatality ratio of COVID-19 cases in the Mexican population under 18 years of age registered in the National Epidemiological Surveillance System from March 2020 to December 31, 2020. Material and Methods: The design is cross-sectional, quantitative, and analytical. All the suspected cases of respiratory viral disease, with a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result, aged from 0 to 17 years, were included. Descriptive statistics are presented for all the variables. Epidemiological curves were designed. The chi-squared test and its P-values were obtained to show the relationship between comorbidities and death. The case fatality ratio was computed for each comorbidity, sex, and age group. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to study the effect between comorbidities with the fatality of cases, adjusting for sex and age group as potential confounders. The alpha value was fixed to 0.05 to assess significance. Results: The number of records for this study was 167,856. Among them, 48,505 were from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (28.90%), and 119,351 (71.10%) were negative. Of those who died, males (55.29%) (P < 0.05) and those under 2 years of age (50.35%) (P < 0.05) predominated. Unlike in older populations, from the comorbidities considered risk factors for death by COVID-19, only immunosuppression showed a statistically significant effect on the fatality of cases after adjustment by the other related variables. Sex and age group were not confounders for the models in those under 18 years old. Pneumonia, being younger than 5 years, and immunosuppression are related to death. Conclusion: The case fatality ratio in those under 18 years old is low. Special attention must be paid to those children under 5 years. The development of pneumonia is a warning indicator while treating them. On the other hand, having an open database of cases allows the researchers to analyze the impact of COVID-19 in different population sectors, which has clear benefits for public health.","COVID-19-Associated Case Fatality Rate in Subjects Under 18 Years Old in Mexico, up to December 31, 2020","Navarro-Olivos, E., Padilla-Raygoza, N., Flores-Vargas, G., Gallardo-Luna, M.D., Leon-Verdin, M.G., Lara-Lona, E., Magos-Vazquez, F.J., Diaz-Martinez, D.A.",2021,FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS,9,,696425,,,8.0,0.0,10.3389/fped.2021.696425,,"[Navarro-Olivos, Efrain] Inst Publ Hlth Guanajuato State, Directorate Teaching & Res, Guanajuato, Mexico; [Padilla-Raygoza, Nicolas; Flores-Vargas, Gilberto; De Jesus Gallardo-Luna, Maria; Guadalupe Leon-Verdin, Ma] Inst Publ Hlth Guanajuato State, Dept Res & Technol Dev, Directorate Teaching & Res, Guanajuato, Mexico; [Lara-Lona, Elia] Univ Guanajuato, Dept Med & Nutr, Div Hlth Sci, Leon, Mexico; [Magos-Vazquez, Francisco J.; Alberto Diaz-Martinez, Daniel] Inst Publ Hlth Guanajuato State, Dept Hlth Serv, Guanajuato, Mexico",,SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; children; fatality; co-morbidities,CORONAVIRUS DISEASE; COVID-19; CHILDREN,SARS-CoV-2;COVID-19;children;fatality;co-morbidities;CORONAVIRUS DISEASE,npadillar@guanajuato.gob.mx,,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,,,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,2296-2360,,,34660475.0,English,FRONT PEDIATR,Article,WoS,Pediatrics,WOS:000707752700001,2-s2.0-85117151049,Mexico,guanajuato.gob.mx,Inst Publ Hlth Guanajuato State;Univ Guanajuato,"Inst Publ Hlth Guanajuato State, Mexico;Univ Guanajuato, Mexico","Navarro-Olivos, Efrain; Padilla-Raygoza, Nicolas; Flores-Vargas, Gilberto; De Jesus Gallardo-Luna, Maria; Guadalupe Leon-Verdin, Ma; Lara-Lona, Elia; Magos-Vazquez, Francisco J.; Alberto Diaz-Martinez, Daniel",97.0,
,,"Background Pregnant women have been classified as at risk for COVID-19 due to previous experience with influenza and other coronaviruses. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for the complications and death in women of childbearing age and pregnant women with suspected COVID-19. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted from the beginning of the epidemic in Mexico until May 25, 2020. All women of childbearing age (13-49 years) from the open national COVID-19 database from the Ministry of Health of Mexico were considered for eligibility. SARS-COV-2 infection was confirmed or ruled out by RT-qPCR. We performed a bivariate and multivariable analysis to estimate mortality risk. Results Ten (2.2%) pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 died. Positive pregnant patients did not have a higher risk of complications (admission to the ICU, pneumonia, or requirement for mechanical ventilation) or death than the controls. In the multivariate analysis, only history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease remained independently associated with death in the positive cohort. Seven (0.6%) pregnant women with a negative test died. In bivariate analysis, pregnant patients with a positive test had a higher risk of death than pregnant patients with a negative test (relative risk (RR) = 3.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.48-10.12), but no higher risk was found than in non-pregnant women with a positive test (RR = 0.82, 95% CI =0.44-1.53), and 60-day mortality did not significantly differ among pregnant patients with or without a positive test (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.40, 95% CI =0.12-1.30) or between COVID-19-positive patients who were pregnant or not pregnant (HR= 0.74, 95% CI = 0.35-1.56). Conclusions Pregnant patients do not have a greater risk of complications or death from COVID-19 than non-pregnant patients.

,,"To understand and approach the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, machine learning offers fundamental tools. This study presents the use of machine learning techniques for projecting COVID-19 infections and deaths in Mexico. The research has three main objectives: first, to identify which function adjusts the best to the infected population growth in Mexico; second, to determine the feature importance of climate and mobility; third, to compare the results of a traditional time series statistical model with a modern approach in machine learning. The motivation for this work is to support health care providers in their preparation and planning. The methods compared are linear, polynomial, and generalized logistic regression models to describe the growth of COVID-19 incidents in Mexico. Additionally, machine learning and time series techniques are used to identify feature importance and perform forecasting for daily cases and fatalities. The study uses the publicly available data sets from the John Hopkins University of Medicine in conjunction with the mobility rates obtained from Google’s Mobility Reports and climate variables acquired from the Weather Online API. The results suggest that the logistic growth model fits best the pandemic’s behavior, that there is enough correlation of climate and mobility variables with the disease numbers, and that the Long short-term memory network can be exploited for predicting daily cases. Given this, we propose a model to predict daily cases and fatalities for SARS-CoV-2 using time series data, mobility, and weather variables. © 2021, The Author(s).",Data Analysis and Forecasting of the COVID-19 Spread: A Comparison of Recurrent Neural Networks and Time Series Models,"Gomez-Cravioto D.A., Diaz-Ramos R.E., Cantu-Ortiz F.J., Ceballos H.G.",2021,Cognitive Computation,,,,,,,8.0,10.1007/s12559-021-09885-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107196344&doi=10.1007%2fs12559-021-09885-y&partnerID=40&md5=346bc527f67ff06648f4cf40ef3985ee,"School of Engineering and Sciences, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Monterrey, 64849, N.L., Mexico","Gomez-Cravioto D.A., School of Engineering and Sciences, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Monterrey, 64849, N.L., Mexico; Diaz-Ramos R.E., School of Engineering and Sciences, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Monterrey, 64849, N.L., Mexico; Cantu-Ortiz F.J., School of Engineering and Sciences, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Monterrey, 64849, N.L., Mexico; Ceballos H.G., School of Engineering and Sciences, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Monterrey, 64849, N.L., Mexico",Covid19; Data science; Recurrent neural networks; Time series forecasting,Climate models; Diseases; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Population statistics; Recurrent neural networks; Time series; Time series analysis; Health care providers; John Hopkins University; Logistic growth model; Logistic regression models; Machine learning techniques; Statistical modeling; Time series models; Time series techniques; Learning systems,Covid19;Data science;Recurrent neural networks;Time series forecasting;Climate models;Diseases;Forecasting;Logistic regression;Population statistics;Time series;Time series analysis;Health care providers;John Hopkins University;Logistic growth model;Logistic regression models;Machine learning techniques;Statistical modeling;Time series models;Time series techniques;Learning systems,"R.E.

,,"Mexican lime (Citrus aurantifolia) belongs to the Rutaceae family and nowadays is one of the major commercial citrus crops in different countries. In Mexico, Mexican lime production is impaired by Huanglongbing (HLB) disease associated to Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) bacteria. To date, transcriptomic studies of CLas-Citrus interaction, have been performed mainly in sweet citrus models at symptomatic (early) stage where pleiotropic responses could mask important, pathogen-driven host modulation as well as, host antibacterial responses. Additionally, well-assembled reference transcriptomes for acid limes including C. aurantifolia are not available. The development of improved transcriptomic resources for CLas-citrus pathosystem, including both asymptomatic (early) and symptomatic (late) stages, could accelerate the understanding of the disease. Here, we provide the first transcriptomic analysis from healthy and HLB-infected C. aurantifolia leaves at both asymptomatic and symptomatic stages, using a RNA-seq approach in the Illumina NexSeq500 platform. The construction of the assembled transcriptome was conducted using the predesigned workflow Transflow and a total of 41,522 tentative transcripts (TTs) obtained. These C. aurantifolia TTs were functionally annotated using TAIR10 and UniProtKB databases. All raw reads were deposited in the NCBI SRA with accession numbers SRR10353556, SRR10353558, SRR10353560 and SRR10353562.

,,"OBJECTIVE. To describe the annual bimonthly distribution of cases of maternal mortality at the national and Yucatan state levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional study, which included all direct maternal mortality registries with ICD-10 letter ""O"" registered in the open access databases of the Mexican Ministry of Health, between 2002-2016. The distribution of expected/observed MM ratio was plotted by bimonthly. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14 statistical program. RESULTS: In Mexico, an average of 2,549,398 births were recorded between 2002 and 2016, with an average bimonthly birth rate in the state of Yucatan of 3.02 ± 0.32, with maximum values in September and October. Throughout the country, an average annual maternal mortality rate of 1123 cases was recorded between 2002 and 2016. The total number of cases of direct maternal mortality was 17,088 at the national level and 269 in the state of Yucatan (1.57%). In the analysis of bimonthly distribution of cases of maternal mortality, a uniform bimonthly frequency (0.94-1.06) was observed at the national level, while a unimodal distribution was observed in the September-October bimonthly (0.76-1.42) for the state of Yucatan. The relative risk of maternal mortality in the state of Yucatan is significantly higher in September-October bimonthly (RR = 0.57- CI95% 0.73:1.00; p < 0.05), period in which almost a quarter of the mortality cases occurred. CONCLUSIONS. The seasonal distribution of national maternal mortality shows subtle bimonthly variation, but in the state of Yucatan, significantly more cases occur in the September-October bimonthly, which coincides with the distribution of births in the state. © 2018, Asociacion Mexicana de Ginecologia y Obstetricia.

,,"Background: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in preventing HIV transmission, yet patients interested in learning more about PrEP or in getting a PrEP prescription may not be able to find local medical providers willing to prescribe PrEP. Objective: We sought to create a national database of PrEP-providing clinics to allow for patients to have access to a unified, vetted source of PrEP providers in an easily accessible database. Methods: To develop the protocol and operating procedures for the PrEP Locator, we conducted a series of 7 key informant interviews with experts who had organized PrEP or other HIV service directories. We convened an external advisory committee and a collaborators board to gain expert and community-situated perspectives. Results: At its public release in September 2016, the database included 1,272 PrEP-providing clinics, including clinics in all 50 states and in Puerto Rico. Web searches, referrals, and outreach to state health departments identified 58 unique lists of PrEP-providing clinics, with 33 from state health departments, 6 from government localities, 2 from professional medical organizations, and 19 from nongovernmental organizations. Out of the 2,420 clinics identified from the lists and Web searches, we removed 798 as duplicate entries, and we determined that 350 were ineligible for listing. The most common reasons for ineligibility were not having the appropriate medical licensure to prescribe PrEP (67/350) or not prescribing PrEP, based on self-report (192/350). Key informant interviews shaped important protocol decisions, such as listing clinics instead of individual clinicians as the primary data element and streamlining data collection to facilitate scalability. We developed a Web interface to provide public access to the data, with geolocated data display, search filter functionality, a webform for public suggestions of new clinics, and a publicly available directory Web tool that can be embedded in websites. In the 6 months following release, preplocator.org and hosting websites had received over 35,000 unique views and 300 clinic additions, and 5 websites had initiated hosting of the widget. Conclusions: Directories exist for many preventive and treatment services. As new medical applications become available, there will be a corresponding need to develop new directories for service provision. Geolocated directories can assist patients in accessing care and have the potential to increase demand for and access to newer, more efficacious medical interventions. Early choices in the development of service directories have long-lasting impact, because once data collection begins, it can be challenging to reverse course. The PrEP Locator protocol may inform early decisions in the development of future service directories. Additionally, the case study on developing the PrEP Locator demonstrates the importance of formative work in identifying service-specific factors that can guide decisions on directory development. © Aaron J Siegler, Susan Wirtz, Shannon Weber, Patrick S Sullivan.

,,"This study proposes a novel method that uses electroencephalography (EEG) signals to classify Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and demographically matched healthy control groups. The method utilizes the reduced beta activity and amplitude decrease in EEG signals that are associated with PD. The study involved 61 PD patients and 61 demographically matched controls groups, and EEG signals were recorded in various conditions (eyes closed, eyes open, eyes both open and closed, on-drug, off-drug) from three publicly available EEG data sources (New Mexico, Iowa, and Turku). The preprocessed EEG signals were classified using features obtained from gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features through the Hankelization of EEG signals. The performance of classifiers with these novel features was evaluated using extensive cross-validations (CV) and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) schemes. This method under 10 × 10 fold CV, the method was able to differentiate PD groups from healthy control groups using a support vector machine (SVM) with an accuracy of 92.4 ± 0.01, 85.7 ± 0.02, and 77.1 ± 0.06 for New Mexico, Iowa, and Turku datasets, respectively. After a head-to-head comparison with state-of-the-art methods, this study showed an increase in the classification of PD and controls. © 2023 by the authors.",Distinguishing Parkinson’s Disease with GLCM Features from the Hankelization of EEG Signals,"Karakas M.F., Latifoglu F.",2023,Diagnostics,13,10,1769,,,,0.0,10.3390/diagnostics13101769,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160534723&doi=10.3390%2fdiagnostics13101769&partnerID=40&md5=b57497378044e860f3f1a3572c299090,"Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Erzincan Binali Yildirim University, Erzincan, 24002, Turkey; Faculty of Engineering, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Erciyes University, Kayseri, 38280, Turkey","Karakaş M.F., Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Erzincan Binali Yildirim University, Erzincan, 24002, Turkey; Latifoğlu F., Faculty of Engineering, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Erciyes University, Kayseri, 38280, Turkey",classifier; diagnosis; EEG; GLCM features; Hankel matrix; Parkinson’s disease,,classifier;diagnosis;EEG;GLCM features;Hankel matrix;Parkinson’s disease,"M.F.

,,"The prevalence and taxonomic diversity of bacteria cultured from the blood of apparently healthy Lesser Electric Rays Narcine bancroftii captured from open beach habitat in the north-central Gulf of Mexico are reported herein. The blood of 9 out of 10 Lesser Electric Rays was positive for bacteria, and bacterial isolates (n = 83) were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The majority of the isolates belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria (91.5%). Vibrio spp. comprised 53% of all isolates and were recovered from all Lesser Electric Rays with culture-positive blood. Among them, V. harveyi (n = 14) and V. campbellii (n = 11) were most common, followed by a group of unidentified Vibrio sp. (n = 10) related to V. nigripulchritudo. Isolates representing other species of Proteobacteria included Pseudoal-teromonas (n = 13), Shewanella (n = 5), Amphritea (n = 3), Nautella (n = 3), and Arenibacter (n = 1). Higher bacterial diversity was observed in blood cultured on marine agar relative to blood agar, but gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the latter only. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of bacterial isolates were compared phylogenetically to those from related type strains. Most isolates were identified to the level of species, but some clustered independently from reference strains, likely representing new species of Vibrio, Amphritea, Shewanella, and Tenacibaculum. The present study is the first record of any bacterium from this ray species and reveals a taxonomically and phylogenetically diverse microbiota associated with its blood. Moreover, these data document that the presence of bacteria in elasmobranch blood is not coincident with clinical signs of disease, thereby rejecting the paradigm of septicemia indicating a disease condition in aquatic vertebrates.",Diversity of Bacteria Cultured from the Blood of Lesser Electric Rays Caught in the Northern Gulf of Mexico,"Tao, Z., Bullard, S.A., Arias, C.R.",2014,JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH,26,4,,225,232,8.0,7.0,10.1080/08997659.2014.922513,,"[Tao, Zhen; Arias, Cova R.] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, Aquat Microbiol Lab, Auburn, AL 36832 USA; [Tao, Zhen] Ningbo Univ, Sch Marine Sci, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Bullard, Stephen A.] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, Aquat Parasitol Lab, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",,,SP-NOV.; DATABASE; SEDIMENT; SHARKS; FLORA; GEN.; GILL,SP-NOV.;DATABASE;SEDIMENT;SHARKS;FLORA;GEN.;GILL,ariascr@auburn.edu,,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,WILEY,0899-7659,,,25321403.0,English,J AQUAT ANIM HEALTH,Article,WoS,Fisheries; Veterinary Sciences,WOS:000348032500004,,United States;China,auburn.edu,Auburn Univ;Ningbo Univ,"Auburn Univ, United States;Ningbo Univ, China","Tao, Zhen; Bullard, Stephen A.; Arias, Cova R.",126.0,

That year, a field study of trivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV-T) was conducted in Temple-Belton, Texas, as part of a larger community-based, non-randomized, open-label study in three communities that began in August 1998 [Gaglani MJ, Piedra PA, Herschler GB, Griffith ME, Kozinetz CA, Riggs MW, et al.

The main outcome measure was medical ly-attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI). Surveillance culture results were incorporated into the analysis to estimate efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza illness. Vaccine effectiveness of LAIV-T against MAARI was 26% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11, 39). Vaccine efficacy of LAIV-T against culture-confirmed influenza illness including surveillance cultures of children in the SWHP database in the validation calculation was 56% (95% CI 24, 84). LAIV-T was cross-protective with a drift variant strain in 2003-2004, evidence that such vaccines could be important for preparing for a pandemic and for annual influenza. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The modeling consisted in the current scenario in Mexico (10% recycling) versus four alternative scenarios: 0% recycling, 25% recycling, 35% recycling and elimination of open dump disposal considering experience in other countries and real possibilities of medium-term management. All practices of management and recycling are considered in the model with changes in the recycling rates and installed infrastructure for different alternatives proposals. On the other hand, the model included that dismantling operations are done mostly with manual labor; transportation, extraction and processing of printed wiring boards, including local process of transforming, heating and melting of materials and considering recycling in Asian countries with all the environmental burdens processes involving transoceanic transportation and metallurgy. The majority of non-precious metals recycling was considered to take place locally. A substantial benefit was identified for all recycling scenarios, particularly in the elimination of open dump disposal and the recycling of 35% of the stream and was found that there was a high impact on climate change and adverse toxic effects to health and natural environments for the practice of accumulating waste in sanitary landfills and dumpsites as well as by burning of materials (plastics and others) in open areas. The use of recycled materials versus virgin materials was also beneficial up to 10 times for reduction in global warming potential impact and up to 3 times reduction for human toxic potential. Public policies might be recommended in order to protect health and environment. As public policy recommendations, it is proposed reinforcement the national infrastructure to collect EoL computers- and transformation of materials into new commercial products, and as a starting point for the recycling of all generated materials, including plastics and printed wiring boards, but should also include the promotion of research for the transformation of plastic waste and the implementation of new technologies that can be adopted by the national recycling industry and create new regulations that result in the production or import of EoL computers and other electronics with low levels of toxic substances as their main components. Other public policies should include the legal prohibition of use of landfills and dumps for containment of EoL computers and other electrical and electronic equipment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

,,"Objective: Describe the epidemiological profile and social-economic burden that hydrocephalus patients represent to the national public health system, using data available at the online data-base of the Brazilian Health Ministry (DataSUS).Methods: This is a populational study based on descriptive statistics of all clinical and surgical appointments included in the DataSUS database. Data included herein were collected between 2015 and 2021 and subdivided into three main groups, related to hydrocephalus incidence and mortality, hospitalizations, and financial costs.Results: In the study period, 3993 new cases of congenital hydrocephalus were diagnosed, with 6051 deaths overall. The mortality rate in the country was 1.5/100000 live births and the preva-lence was 0.374/100000 inhabitants. The number of hospitalizations resulting from treatment procedures and complications of hydrocephalus was 137,880 and there was a reduction of up to 27.2% during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics concerning previous years. Total costs for hydrocephalus management in the country amounted to 140,610,585.51 dollars. Conclusions: Hydrocephalus has a significant impact on public health budgets and pediatric mortal-ity rates; however, it is probably underestimated, due to the paucity of demographic data and epi-demiological studies in Latin America and, specifically, in Brazil. The dataSUS also has several limitations in accessing certain data related to hydrocephalus, making it difficult to have a more assertive understanding of the disease in Brazil. The results of this study provide important guidance for future research projects in clinical and experimental hydrocephalus and also the creation of public policies for better governance and care of hydrocephalus patients.(c) 2022 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

When data on individual nutrient intakes are available, they have not been consistently disaggregated by sex and age groups, and their parameters and full distributions are often not publicly available. Objectives: We sought to derive usual intake distributions for as many nutrients and population subgroups as possible, use these distributions to estimate nutrient intake inadequacy, compare these distributions and evaluate the implications of their shapes on the estimation of inadequacy, and make these distributions publicly available. Methods: We compiled dietary data sets from 31 geographically diverse countries, modeled usual intake distributions for 32 micronutrients and 21 macronutrients, and disaggregated these distributions by sex and age groups. We compared the variability and skewness of the distributions and evaluated their similarity across countries, sex, and age groups. We estimated intake inadequacy for 16 nutrients based on a harmonized set of nutrient requirements and bioavailability estimates. Last, we created an R package—nutriR—to make these distributions freely available for users to apply in their own analyses.; Results: Usual intake distributions were rarely symmetric and differed widely in variability and skewness across nutrients and countries. Vitamin intake distributions were more variable and skewed and exhibited less similarity among countries than other nutrients. Inadequate intakes were high and geographically concentrated, as well as generally higher for females than males. We found that the shape of usual intake distributions strongly affects estimates of the prevalence of inadequate intakes. Conclusions: The shape of nutrient intake distributions differs based on nutrient and subgroup and strongly influences estimates of nutrient intake inadequacy. This research represents an important contribution to the availability and application of dietary intake data for diverse subpopulations around the world. © The Author(s) 2022.",Estimating national and subnational nutrient intake distributions of global diets,"Passarelli S., Free C.M., Allen L.H., Batis C., Beal T., Biltoft-Jensen A.P., Bromage S., Cao L., Castellanos-Gutierrez A., Christensen T., Crispim S.P., Dekkers A., De Ridder K., Kronsteiner-Gicevic S., Lee C., Li Y., Moursi M., Moyersoen I., Schmidhuber J., Shepon A., Viana D.F., Golden C.D.",2022,American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,116,2,,551,560,9.0,4.0,10.1093/ajcn/nqac108,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135596520&doi=10.1093%2fajcn%2fnqac108&partnerID=40&md5=d77cd48ff2651c2455629f8c98f262e8,"Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.

,,"The emergence and rapid spread of the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have confirmed that animal coronaviruses represent a potential zoonotic source. Porcine deltacoronavirus is a worldwide evolving enteropathogen of swine, detected first in Hong Kong, China, before its global identification. Following the recent detection of PDCoV in humans, we attempted in this report to re-examine the status of PDCoV phylogenetic classification and evolutionary characteristics. A dataset of 166 complete PDCoV genomes was analyzed using the Maximum Likelihood method in IQ-TREE with the best-fitting model GTR + F + I + G4, revealing two major genogroups (GI and GII), with further seven and two sub-genogroups, (GI a-g) and (GII a-b), respectively. PDCoV strains collected in China exhibited the broadest genetic diversity, distributed in all subgenotypes. Thirty-one potential natural recombination events were identified, 19 of which occurred between China strains, and seven involved at least one China strain as a parental sequence. Importantly, we identified a human Haiti PDCoV strain as recombinant, alarming a possible future spillover that could become a critical threat to human health. The similarity and recombination analysis showed that PDCoV spike ORF is highly variable compared to ORFs encoding other structural proteins. Prediction of linear B cell epitopes of the spike glycoprotein and the 3D structural mapping of amino acid variations of two representative strains of GI and GII showed that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein underwent a significant antigenic drift, suggesting its contribution in the genetic diversity and the wider spread of PDCoV. © 2022, The Author(s).",Evolutionary plasticity of zoonotic porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV): genetic characteristics and geographic distribution,"Bahoussi A.N., Wang P.H., Shah P.T., Bu H., Wu C., Xing L.",2022,BMC Veterinary Research,18,1,444,,,,0.0,10.1186/s12917-022-03554-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144513465&doi=10.1186%2fs12917-022-03554-4&partnerID=40&md5=8349f9fdc3ed62b36e3ca4612575de6a,"Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanxi University, 92 Wucheng Road, Shanxi province, Taiyuan, 030006, China; Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Fourth People’s Hospital of Taiyuan, 231 Xikuang St, Shanxi province, Taiyuan, 030053, China; Shanxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Cell Biology, Shanxi University, 92 Wucheng Road, Taiyuan, 030006, China; Shanxi Provincial Key Laboratory for Prevention and Treatment of Major Infectious Diseases, 92 Wucheng Road, Taiyuan, 030006, China; The Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Molecular Engineering of Ministry of Education, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, 030006, China","Bahoussi A.N., Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanxi University, 92 Wucheng Road, Shanxi province, Taiyuan, 030006, China; Wang P.-H., Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanxi University, 92 Wucheng Road, Shanxi province, Taiyuan, 030006, China; Shah P.T., Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanxi University, 92 Wucheng Road, Shanxi province, Taiyuan, 030006, China; Bu H., Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Fourth People’s Hospital of Taiyuan, 231 Xikuang St, Shanxi province, Taiyuan, 030053, China; Wu C., Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanxi University, 92 Wucheng Road, Shanxi province, Taiyuan, 030006, China, Shanxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Cell Biology, Shanxi University, 92 Wucheng Road, Taiyuan, 030006, China, Shanxi Provincial Key Laboratory for Prevention and Treatment of Major Infectious Diseases, 92 Wucheng Road, Taiyuan, 030006, China, The Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Molecular Engineering of Ministry of Education, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, 030006, China; Xing L., Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanxi University, 92 Wucheng Road, Shanxi province, Taiyuan, 030006, China, Shanxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Cell Biology, Shanxi University, 92 Wucheng Road, Taiyuan, 030006, China, Shanxi Provincial Key Laboratory for Prevention and Treatment of Major Infectious Diseases, 92 Wucheng Road, Taiyuan, 030006, China, The Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Molecular Engineering of Ministry of Education, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, 030006, China",Coronavirus; Linear B cell epitope; Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV); Recombination; Spike glycoprotein; Zoonotic pathogen,Animals; Biological Evolution; COVID-19; Glycoproteins; Humans; Phylogeny; Swine; Swine Diseases; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; epitope; structural protein; viral structural protein; virus envelope protein; virus spike protein; glycoprotein; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; antigenic drift; Article; gene deletion; genetic recombination; genetic trait; genetic variability; geographic distribution; nucleotide sequence; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; Porcine deltacoronavirus; protein structure; receptor binding; receptor binding domain; viral evolution; animal; evolution; human; pig; swine disease; veterinary medicine,Coronavirus;Linear B cell epitope;Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV);Recombination;Spike glycoprotein;Zoonotic pathogen;Animals;Biological Evolution;COVID-19;Glycoproteins;Humans;Phylogeny;Swine;Swine Diseases;coronavirus spike glycoprotein;epitope;structural protein;viral structural protein;virus envelope protein;virus spike protein;glycoprotein;amino acid sequence;amino acid substitution;antigenic drift;Article;gene deletion;genetic recombination;genetic trait;genetic variability;geographic distribution;nucleotide sequence;open reading frame;phylogenetic tree;Porcine deltacoronavirus;protein structure;receptor binding;receptor binding domain;viral evolution;animal;evolution;human;pig;swine disease;veterinary medicine,"C.

,,"Background: The earthquake that struck Haiti on 10 January 2010, killed 200,000 persons and injured thousands more. Working with Partners in Health, a non-governmental organization already present in Haiti, Dartmouth College, and the University of Pennsylvania sent multidisciplinary surgical teams to hospitals in the villages of Hinche and Cange. The purpose of this report is to describe the injuries seen and evolution of treatments rendered at these two outlying regional hospitals during the first month following the earthquake. Methods: A retrospective review of the database maintained by each team was performed. In addition to a list of equipment taken to Haiti, information collected included patient age, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status, injuries sustained, procedures performed, wound management strategy, antibiotic therapy, and early outcomes. Results: A total of 113 surgical procedures were performed in 15 days by both teams. The average patient age was 25 years and average ASA score was 1.4. The majority of injuries involved large soft tissue wounds and closed fractures, although 21-40% of the patients at each hospital had either an open fracture or amputation wound. Initially, wound debridement was the most common procedure performed, but after two weeks, skin grafting, fracture fixation, and amputation revision were the more commonly needed operations. Conclusions: Academic surgical teams can ameliorate the morbidity and mortality following disasters caused by natural hazards by partnering with organizations that already have a presence in the affected region. A multidisciplinary team of surgeons and nurses can improve both mortality and morbidity following a disaster.",Evolution of Operative Interventions by Two University-Based Surgical Teams in Haiti during the First Month following the Earthquake,"Sarani, B., Mehta, S., Ashburn, M., Gupta, R., Dombroski, D., Raymonville, M., Schwab, C.W.",2011,PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE,26,3,,206,211,6.0,10.0,10.1017/S1049023X11006236,,"[Sarani, Babak; Schwab, C.

,,"This work aims to contribute to the field of COVID-19 pandemic analysis. In this research we applied a twofold analysis that focused initially on the country general social-economic and medical characteristics and on top of that in a second level exploring the correlations to the characteristics that affect COVID-19 patients' mortality level. The approach has been applied to large datasets that include country level medical and the socio-economic data according to World Health Organization, the role of the cigarette consumption per capita using open datasets, and the cumulative data of the 'COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University' for the total number of Cases, Deaths and Recovered. 101 countries including twenty-two (22) features are studied. We have also drilled in the country of Mexico datasets to show case the effectiveness of our approach. We show that our approach can achieve 96% overall accuracy based on the proposed combination approach of macro and micro features. Our approach outdoes previous study results that utilize machine learning to assist medical decision-making in COVID-19 prognosis. We conclude that country social economic and medical characteristics play important role to COVID-19 patients' prognosis and their outcome.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

,,"Purpose: Latino day laborers are male immigrants from mainly Mexico and Central America who congregate at corners, that is, informal hiring sites, to solicit short-term employment. Studies describing the occupational environment of Latino day laborers traditionally measure jobsite exposures, not corner exposures. We sought to elucidate exposures at corners by describing their demographic, socioeconomic, occupational, business, built, and physical environmental characteristics and by comparing corner characteristics with other locations in a large urban county in Texas. Methods: We used multiple publicly available data sets from the U.S. Census, local tax authority, Google's Nearby Places Application Programming Interface, and Environmental Protection Agency at fine spatial scale to measure 34 characteristics of corners with matched comparison locations. Results: Corners were located close to highways, high-traffic intersections, hardware and moving stores, and gas stations. Corners were in neighborhoods with large foreign-born and Latino populations, high rates of limited English proficiency, and high construction-sector employment. Conclusions: Publicly available data sources describe demographic, socioeconomic, occupational, business, built, and physical environment characteristics of urban environments at fine spatial scale. Using these data, we identified unique corner-based exposures experienced by day laborers.

,,"An earthquake occurred in Haiti on January 12, 2010. The center of earthquake and the most extensive damage occurred near the capital Port-au-Prince. There were an estimated 230,000 deaths with more than 250,000 others injured. The Israeli Defense Forces Field Hospital (IDF hospital) is a military unit composed of army-recruited (volunteer) medical personnel that was sent to Haiti to serve as a stand-alone center for early response until larger medical missions could become functional and take on the task of more sophisticated and long-lasting medical support. This study describes the use of external fixator frames for orthopedic damage control whereby bone stabilization in conjunction with soft tissue care serves as a stopgap until more comprehensive therapy is forthcoming. Methods:Data were collected from patients' files (generated at the IDF hospital) regarding the use and immediate outcome of limbs stabilized by external fixator frames. Results:During the 10 days of the IDF hospital's activity, a total of 1,111 patients were admitted; 244 surgical procedures were performed under general or regional anesthesia and of these, the orthopedists performed 221 (90%) surgical procedures. Seventy-three fractures were stabilized operatively by application of an external fixator. Most of the frames were applied on fractures (closed and open) of the lower limbs (48 on femur and 24 on tibia/fibula). All procedures were performed in a field-style operating room. Sterile technique was possible only for elements actually inserted into the patient. Limb alignment was based on manual palpation: intraoperative fluoroscopy was not available; soft tissue care followed bone stabilization. No patient died. All patients completed urgent stabilization at the IDF hospital and were transferred to other facilities or discharged for home care. Conclusions:We describe “orthopedic damage control” using external fixator frames for bone stabilization and soft tissue care as a viable approach in the context of a mass casualty scenario. Technical aspects are described in detail in addition to the advantages and limitations of this approach, which could serve as guidelines for future military and civilian scenarios where large-scale orthopedic damage control would be practiced. © 2011 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Inc.",External fixator frames as interim damage control for limb injuries: experience in the 2010 haiti earthquake,"Lebel E., Blumberg N., Gill A., Merin O., Gelfond R., Bar-On E.",2011,Journal of Trauma,71,6,,E128,E131,3.0,32.0,10.1097/TA.0b013e3182147654,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84255199885&doi=10.1097%2fTA.0b013e3182147654&partnerID=40&md5=e18784c5d352e62a05de8a7c8b72d0de,"Israeli Defense Forces, Medical Corps, Israel; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Hadassah-Hebrew University School of Medicine, Jerusalem, Israel; Department of Cardiac Surgery, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Hadassah-Hebrew University School of Medicine, Jerusalem, Israel; Department of Orthopedics, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel; Hadassah Mt.

The objectives were: (a) to evaluate the feasibility of using the Omaha System at the community level to reflect community strengths and (b) to describe preliminary results of community strengths observations across international settings. Design and SampleA descriptive qualitative design was used. The sample was a data set of 284 windshield surveys by nursing students in 5 countries: Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Turkey, and the United States. MeasuresAn online survey included a checklist and open-ended questions on community strengths for 11 concepts of the Omaha System Problem Classification Scheme: Income, Sanitation, Residence, Neighborhood/workplace safety, Communication with community resources, Social contact, Interpersonal relationship, Spirituality, Nutrition, Substance use, and Health care supervision. Themes were derived through content analysis of responses to the open-ended questions. ResultsFeasibility was demonstrated: Students were able to use the Omaha System terms and collect data on strengths. Common themes were described among the five countries. ConclusionsThe Omaha System appears to be useful in documenting community-level strengths.

,,"Objectives It was intended to devise fetal mortality tables with a new perspective: the use of weight at the moment of expulsing the conception outcome as an explanatory variable instead of the length of gestation. Methods The universe of study was made up of all the twenty two or over week pregnancies expulsed during the 1998-2002 period in Cuba. The information came from the perinatal death and livebirth databases of the National Division of Medical Register and Health Statistics of the Ministry of Public Health of Cuba, and of the National Office of Statistics, respectively. Since temporality demanded by the mortality table is not unique in terms of weight-gestational age correspondence; two basic assumptions were set: continuity of the weight variable that eliminates any doubt, and strictly growing condition, an element that is acceptable if assumed under favourable physiological and clinical conditions during pregnancy. Results The results of this formal application of the technique for the design of the mortality table open up a new perspective to estimate fetal death risks as a function of weight, and generally speaking, as a function of variables for which one may assume that fetal development under normal circumstances follows an upward trajectory. Conclusions It is observes that there are some similarities between fetal survival according to gestational age and the fetal survival according to the weight at the moment of delivering the fetus. This fact may become a new prospect for the development and use of the mortality tables.",Fetal mortality tables by gestational age and the weight of the conception outcome; [Tablas de mortalidad fetal según edad gestacional y peso del producto de la concepción],"Barreiro L.A.M., Leon L.H.",2010,Revista Cubana de Salud Publica,36,3,,204,209,5.0,0.0,10.1590/s0864-34662010000300003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78751526954&doi=10.1590%2fs0864-34662010000300003&partnerID=40&md5=c89793c37fecc09e6143dfc7ebedfde8,"Brigada Médica Cubana en Honduras, Honduras; Centro de Estudios Demográficos, Universidad de la Habana, La Habana, Cuba","Barreiro L.A.M., Brigada Médica Cubana en Honduras, Honduras; León L.H., Centro de Estudios Demográficos, Universidad de la Habana, La Habana, Cuba",Fetal permanence or survival; Mortality table; Weight at the moment of delivery,,Fetal permanence or survival;Mortality table;Weight at the moment of delivery,"L.

,,The purpose of this study was to describe the influence of patient gender and ethnicity on physician-patient communication about depression and anxiety. A data set comprised of audiotapes and transcripts of 383 patients' primary care visits was analyzed. Depression was brought up during 25% of medical visits. Depression was more likely to be brought up during the visits of patients who rated their emotional health poorly. Female patients and more educated patients were more likely to initiate the discussion. Anxiety was brought up during 29.5% of medical visits. Anxiety was more likely to be brought up during family practice visits and during visits with Asian physicians. Physicians were more likely to ask male patients and patients who had fewer previous visits closed-ended questions about anxiety. Physicians were more likely to ask Hispanic patients and patients who rated their emotional health poorly one or more open-ended questions about anxiety. Female physicians were more likely to counsel patients than male physicians. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

,,"Background: Variation in tibia geometry is a risk factor for tibial stress fractures. Geometric variability in bones is often quantified using statistical shape modelling. Statistical shape models (SSM) offer a method to assess three-dimensional variation of structures and identify the source of variation. Although SSM have been used widely to assess long bones, there is limited open-source datasets of this kind. Overall, the creation of SSM can be an expensive process, that requires advanced skills. A publicly available tibia shape model would be beneficial as it enables researchers to improve skills. Further, it could benefit health, sport and medicine with the potential to assess geometries suitable for medical equipment, and aid in clinical diagnosis. This study aimed to: (i) quantify tibial geometry using a SSM; and (ii) provide the SSM and associated code as an open-source dataset.Methods: Lower limb computed tomography (CT) scans from the right tibia -fibula of 30 cadavers (male n = 20, female n = 10) were obtained from the New Mexico Decedent Image Database. Tibias were segmented and reconstructed into both cortical and trabecular sections. Fibulas were segmented as a singular surface. The segmented bones were used to develop three SSM of the: (i) tibia; (ii) tibia -fibula; and (iii) cortical-trabecular. Principal component analysis was applied to obtain the three SSM, with the principal components that explained 95% of geometric variation retained.Results: Overall size was the main source of variation in all three models accounting for 90.31%, 84.24% and 85.06%. Other sources of geometric variation in the tibia surface models included overall and midshaft thickness; prominence and size of the condyle plateau, tibial tuberosity, and anterior crest; and axial torsion of the tibial shaft. Further variations in the tibia -fibula model included midshaft thickness of the fibula; fibula head position relative to the tibia; tibia and fibula anterior-posterior curvature; fibula posterior curvature; tibia plateau rotation; and interosseous width. The main sources of variation in the cortical-trabecular model other than general size included variation in the medulla cavity diameter; cortical thickness; anterior-posterior shaft curvature; and the volume of trabecular bone in the proximal and distal ends of the bone.Conclusion: Variations that could increase the risk of tibial stress injury were observed, these included general tibial thickness, midshaft thickness, tibial length and medulla cavity diameter (indicative of cortical thickness). Further research is needed to better understand the effect of these tibial -fibula shape characteristics on tibial stress and injury risk. This SSM, the associated code, and three use examples for the SSM have been provided in an open-source dataset.

,,"Background Laparoscopic nephrectomy for living donors is the current procedure of choice. Hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (HALDN) is the variation of this technique currently used in our institution. Though the advantages and disadvantages have been described for this procedure, the graft function compared with open surgery has been shown to be equal. We compared the outcomes of patients undergoing the former standard open donor nephrectomy (ODN) versus the current HALDN technique. Methods In this retrospective, comparative, and analytic study we reviewed our institutional database of renal transplantation procedures from January 2005 to April 2011 for perioperative variables and 1-year follow-up data. Donor renal function was evaluated with serum creatinine concentrations and estimated glomerular filtration rates with the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology formula. Complications were reported with the Clavien-Dindo classification. Results The 190 consecutive donors included 99 ODN and 91 HALDN, who did not show baseline differences. ODN had a shorter mean operative time (217 ± 57.5 vs 270 ± 60.1 minutes) and shorter warm ischemia time (2.12 ± 1.4 vs 4.62 ± 2.7 minutes). HALDN had less operative blood loss (274.4 ± 198.1 vs 202.99 ± 157.1 mL) and shorter in-hospital stay (5.58 ± 2.2 vs 4.23 ± 1.8 days). There were no significant differences in 30-day surgical complications or transfusion requirements. No graft loss was reported. No difference in renal function was observed between the groups at days 1-2 or months 1, 6, or 12 after nephrectomy. Conclusions Laparoscopic surgery has replaced conventional open surgery for living renal donors. HALDN is a safe and successful procedure compared with ODN.

,,"Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the main and most expensive and prolonged causes of hospitalization for childhood cancer. We describe the hospitalization rate and its costs for an open population with ALL in a low-middle income country. Procedure: We retrospectively analyzed 449 hospital admissions for 101 pediatric patients with ALL over 8 years. Clinical files and electronic databases were scrutinized to document causes, duration, readmission rate, costs, and outcome of each admission. Hospitalizations were divided into two categories: general pediatric ward and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Hospitalization rates and its costs per patient were estimated considering person-time at risk. Results: Patients had an admission rate of 2.09 hospitalizations per patient-year and median length of stay per admission was 5 days. Most admissions occurred during the first 2 years from diagnosis. Mean cost per day was 239 US dollars (USD) and mean cost per stay was 2,246 USD versus 1,016 and 19,004 USD (P = 0.001) in the PICU, respectively. Total hospitalization cost per patient per year (PPPY) was 5,991 USD for high-risk patients and 3,038 USD for standard-risk patients. Patients between ages 1 and 9 years had a PPPY cost of $4,057; while for children younger than 1 year or older than 9 years, it was 7,463 USD. The popular medical insurance program covered 70% of hospitalizations and 63% of its total cost; patients contributed 2%, with the hospital absorbing 35%. Conclusions: Hospitalizations for children with ALL were less expensive than in high-income countries but had a significant cost to low-income families and to the healthcare system. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Hospitalization rate and costs in acute lymphoblastic leukemia of childhood in a low-income group: Financial impact in Northeast Mexico,"Jaime-Perez J.C., Fernandez L.T., Jimenez-Castillo R.A., Colunga-Pedraza J.E., Padilla-Medina J.R., Mancias-Guerra C., Gomez-Almaguer D.",2017,Pediatric Blood and Cancer,64,12,e26673,,,,6.0,10.1002/pbc.26673,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020387622&doi=10.1002%2fpbc.26673&partnerID=40&md5=8a41cce92d6a161cfd3f176b2465b222,"Department of Hematology, Dr. José Eleuterio González University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico","Jaime-Pérez J.C., Department of Hematology, Dr. José Eleuterio González University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico; Fernández L.T., Department of Hematology, Dr. José Eleuterio González University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico; Jiménez-Castillo R.A., Department of Hematology, Dr. José Eleuterio González University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico; Colunga-Pedraza J.E., Department of Hematology, Dr. José Eleuterio González University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico; Padilla-Medina J.R., Department of Hematology, Dr. José Eleuterio González University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico; Mancías-Guerra C., Department of Hematology, Dr. José Eleuterio González University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico; Gómez-Almaguer D., Department of Hematology, Dr. José Eleuterio González University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico",acute lymphoblastic leukemia; costs; hospitalization; length of stay; low-income; popular medical insurance,"Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hospital Costs; Hospitalization; Humans; Income; Infant; Intensive Care Units, Pediatric; Length of Stay; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Retrospective Studies; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adolescent; Article; child; child hospitalization; childhood leukemia; female; financial management; health insurance; high risk patient; hospital admission; hospital readmission; hospitalization cost; human; infant; length of stay; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; Mexico; middle income country; pediatric intensive care unit; pediatric ward; priority journal; retrospective study; economics; hospital cost; hospitalization; income; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; preschool child; statistics and numerical data","acute lymphoblastic leukemia;costs;hospitalization;length of stay;low-income;popular medical insurance;Adolescent;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Hospital Costs;Humans;Income;Infant;Intensive Care Units, Pediatric;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma;Retrospective Studies;Article;child hospitalization;childhood leukemia;financial management;health insurance;high risk patient;hospital admission;hospital readmission;hospitalization cost;human;longitudinal study;major clinical study;Mexico;middle income country;pediatric intensive care unit;pediatric ward;priority journal;retrospective study;economics;hospital cost;preschool child;statistics and numerical data","J.C.

,,"Background: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic health condition that has been linked with an increased risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19. In Mexico, the impact of diabetes on COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients has not been fully quantified. Understanding the increased risk posed by diabetes in this patient population can help healthcare providers better allocate resources and improve patient outcomes. Objective: The objective of this study was to quantify the extent outcomes (pneumonia, intensive care unit [ICU] stay, intubation, and death) are worsened in diabetic patients with COVID-19. Methods: Between April 14, 2020 and December 20, 2020 (last accessed), data from the open-source COVID-19 database maintained by the Mexican Federal Government were examined. Utilizing hospitalized COVID-19 patients with complete outcome data, a retrospective cohort study (N = 402,388) was carried out. In relation to COVID-19, both univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to investigate the effect of diabetes on specific outcomes. Results: The analysis included 402,388 adults (age >18) with confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 cases with mean age 46.16 (standard deviation = 15.55), 214,161 (53%) male. The outcomes delineated included pneumonia (N = 88,064; 22%), ICU requirement (N = 23,670; 6%), intubation (N = 23,670; 6%), and death (N = 55,356; 14%). After controlling for confounding variables diabetes continued to be an independent risk factor for both pneumonia (odds ratio [OR]: 1.8, confidence interval [CI]: 1.76-1.84, p < 0.01), ICU requirement (OR: 1.09, CI: 1.04-1.14, p < 0.01), intubation (OR: 1.07, CI: 1.04-1.11, p < 0.01), and death (OR: 1.88, CI: 1.84-1.93, p < 0.01) in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: According to the study, all outcomes (pneumonia, ICU requirement, intubation, and death) were greater among hospitalized individuals with diabetes and COVID-19. Additional study is required to acquire a better understanding of how diabetes affects COVID-19 outcomes and to develop practical mitigation techniques for the risk of severe sickness and complications in this particular patient population.","Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes have an increased risk for pneumonia, intensive care unit requirement, intubation, and death: A cross-sectional cohort study in Mexico in 2020","Huang, A.A., Huang, S.Y.",2023,HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS,6,4,e1222,,,7.0,0.0,10.1002/hsr2.1222,,"[Huang, Alexander A.; Huang, Samuel Y.] Cornell Univ, Dept Stat & Data Sci, Ithaca, NY USA; [Huang, Alexander A.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL USA; [Huang, Samuel Y.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Med, Richmond, VA USA",,COVID-19; diabetes mellitus; ICU; intubation; logistic regression; Mexico; mortality; pneumonia; resource allocation; retrospective cohort study; risk factors,MORTALITY; MELLITUS; SEVERITY; INFLUENZA; OUTCOMES,COVID-19;diabetes mellitus;ICU;intubation;logistic regression;Mexico;mortality;pneumonia;resource allocation;retrospective cohort study;risk factors;MELLITUS;SEVERITY;INFLUENZA;OUTCOMES,huangs8@vcu.edu,,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,WILEY,,,,37081996.0,English,HEALTH SCI REP-US,Article,WoS,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; General & Internal Medicine",WOS:000974270600001,2-s2.0-85153763072,United States,vcu.edu,Cornell Univ;Northwestern Univ;Virginia Commonwealth Univ,"Cornell Univ, United States;Northwestern Univ, United States;Virginia Commonwealth Univ, United States","Huang, Alexander A.; Huang, Samuel Y.",206.0,

Our pediatrics hospital is a public institution of the Mexican Social Security Institute. We report our experience in the surgical treatment of congenital heart disease during the neonatal period. Methods: From our service database, we included patients < 30 days of life with congenital heart disease, receiving heart surgery during the period from September 2015 to September 2020. Results: A total of 350 cases were included (171 male and 179 female), 111 were preterm babies (31.7%). Surgical closure of the persistent arterious duct was the most common procedure in 138 cases (39.4%), followed by modified Blalock-Taussig systemic pulmonary shunt in 92 cases (26.3%). Closed cardiac surgery (without extracorporeal circulation support) accounted for 68.6% of our surgeries. Other surgical techniques performed were arterial switch operation (N = 38), anomalous pulmonary veins connection repair (N = 37), truncus correction, coarctectomy, and Norwood palliation. Score surgical risk RACHS-1 were: I with 139 cases (39.7%), and >= III with 211 cases (60%). Inhospital mortality was 20% with 70 deaths, mainly related to cardiogenic shock (92%). Mean postoperative hospital stay in neonatal intensive care area was 20 +/- 11 days. Conclusions: Our department of pediatric heart surgery has experience in the treatment of neonates with congenital heart disease.

,,"The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) has been shown to increase breastfeeding rates, improving maternal and child health and driving down healthcare costs via the benefits of breastfeeding. Despite its clear public health and economic benefits, one key challenge of implementing the BFHI is procuring funding to sustain the program. To address this need and help healthcare stakeholders advocate for funds, we developed a structured method to estimate the first-year cost of implementing BFHI staff training, using the United States (US) and Mexico as case studies. The method used a hospital system-wide costing approach, rather than costing an individual hospital, to estimate the average per birth BFHI staff training costs in US and Mexican hospitals with greater than 500 annual births. It was designed to utilize publicly available data. Therefore, we used the 2014 American Hospital Association dataset (n = 1401 hospitals) and the 2018 Mexican Social Security Institute dataset (n = 154 hospitals). Based on our review of the literature, we identified three key training costs and modelled scenarios via an econometric approach to assess the sensitivity of the estimates based on hospital size, level of obstetric care, and training duration and intensity. Our results indicated that BFHI staff training costs ranged from USD 7.27-125.39 per birth in the US and from PPP 2.68-6.14 per birth in Mexico, depending on hospital size and technological capacity. Estimates differed between countries because the US had more hospital staff per birth and higher staff salaries than Mexico. Future studies should examine whether similar, publicly available data exists in other countries to test if our method can be replicated or adapted for use in additional settings. Healthcare stakeholders can better advocate for the funding to implement the entire BFHI program if they are able to generate informed cost estimates for training as we did here.",How much does it cost to implement the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative training step in the United States and Mexico?,"Arslanian, K.J., Vilar-Compte, M., Teruel, G., Lozano-Marrufo, A., Rhodes, E.C., Hromi-Fiedler, A., Garcia, E., Perez-Escamilla, R.",2022,PLOS ONE,17,9,e0273179,,,19.0,0.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0273179,,"[Arslanian, Kendall; Vilar-Compte, Mireya C.; Rhodes, Elizabeth C.; Hromi-Fiedler, Amber; Perez-Escamilla, Rafael] Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social & Behav Sci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Vilar-Compte, Mireya C.; Teruel, Graciela; Lozano-Marrufo, Annel; Garcia, Erika] Univ Iberoamer, Res Inst Equitable Dev EQUIDE, Mexico City, Mexico; [Vilar-Compte, Mireya C.] Montclair State Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Montclair, NJ USA; [Rhodes, Elizabeth C.] Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Methods Implementat & Prevent Sci, New Haven, CT USA; [Rhodes, Elizabeth C.] Yale Sch Med, Yale Ctr Implementat Sci, New Haven, CT USA",,,SCALING-UP; NUTRITION; EDUCATION; PROGRAMS; QUALITY; OBESITY; RATES,SCALING-UP;NUTRITION;EDUCATION;PROGRAMS;QUALITY;OBESITY;RATES,kendall.arslanian@yale.edu,,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",,,,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,1932-6203,,,36170264.0,English,PLOS ONE,Article,WoS,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000967504100001,2-s2.0-85139224094,United States;Mexico,yale.edu,Yale Sch Publ Hlth;Univ Iberoamer;Montclair State Univ;Yale Sch Med,"Yale Sch Publ Hlth, United States;Univ Iberoamer, Mexico;Montclair State Univ, United States;Yale Sch Med, United States","Arslanian, Kendall; Vilar-Compte, Mireya C.; Teruel, Graciela; Lozano-Marrufo, Annel; Rhodes, Elizabeth C.; Hromi-Fiedler, Amber; Garcia, Erika; Perez-Escamilla, Rafael",210.0,
,,"The current COVID-19 public health crisis, caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has produced a devastating toll both in terms of human life loss and economic disruption. In this paper we present a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying whether a given patient (actually infected or suspected to be infected) is more likely to survive than to die, or vice-versa. We train this algorithm with historical data, including medical history, demographic data, as well as COVID-19-related information. This is extracted from a database of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infections in Mexico, constituting the official COVID-19 data compiled and made publicly available by the Mexican Federal Government. We demonstrate that the proposed method can detect high-risk patients with high accuracy, in each of four identified clinical stages, thus improving hospital capacity planning and timely treatment. Furthermore, we show that our method can be extended to provide optimal estimators for hypothesis-testing techniques commonly-used in biological and medical statistics.

,,"Background: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are the second most common complex birth defect, yet, our understanding of the genetic contribution to their development remains incomplete. Two environmental factors associated with NTDs are Folate and One Carbon Metabolism (FOCM) and Glucose Homeostasis and Oxidative Stress (GHOS). Utilizing next-generation sequencing of a large patient cohort, we identify novel candidate genes in these two networks to provide insights into NTD mechanisms. Methods: Exome sequencing (ES) was performed in 511 patients, born with myelomeningocele, divided between European American and Mexican American ethnicities. Healthy control data from the Genome Aggregation database were ethnically matched and used as controls. Rare, high fidelity, nonsynonymous predicted damaging missense, nonsense, or canonical splice site variants in independently generated candidate gene lists for FOCM and GHOS were identified. We used a gene-based collapsing approach to quantify mutational burden in case and controls, with the control cohort estimated using cumulative allele frequencies assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Results: We identified 45 of 837 genes in the FOCM network and 22 of 568 genes in the GHOS network as possible NTD risk genes withp < 0.05. No nominally significant risk genes were shared between ethnicities. Using a novel approach to mutational burden we identify 55 novel NTD risk associations. Conclusions: We provide a means of utilizing large publicly available sequencing datasets as controls for sequencing projects examining rare disease. This approach confirmed existing risk genes for myelomeningocele and identified possible novel risk genes.

,,"Introduction and aims: There is no systematized information for determining/monitoring the burden of inflammatory bowel disease in Mexico. The aim of the present study was to estimate the annual burden of inflammatory bowel disease on the Mexican National Healthcare System, by number of patients seen, hospitalizations, and specific deaths, stratified into age groups. Materials and methods: Utilizing specific databases of the Mexican National Healthcare System registries coded as ICD-10: K50 and K51, we retrieved and analyzed the data corresponding to the patients seen and hospitalized in 2015, stratified by age group, as well as the specific deaths. Treatment trends among physicians were also examined. Results: In 2015, 5,009 women (8.1) and 4,944 men (8.4) with Crohn's disease received medical attention (prevalence of cases seen) and 35.1% of those patients were >= 50 years of age. In that same period, 17,177 women (27.7) and 15,883 men (26.9) with ulcerative colitis were seen and 31.6% of those patients were >= 50 years of age. The hospitalized cases (prevalence of hospitalized cases) were 1,097 patients (0.91) with Crohn's disease and 43.7% of those patients were >= 50 years of age; and 5,345 patients (4.42) with ulcerative colitis and 47.6% of those patients were >= 50 years of age. Deaths (specific mortality rate) were: 32 women (0.52) and 36 men (0.50) due to Crohn's disease, and 267 women (4.31) and 186 men (3.15) due to ulcerative colitis. Conclusions: Inflammatory bowel disease is a burden on the health of Mexican adults and the Mexican National Healthcare System, and it is expected to increase over the next 15 years.

,,"BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Active health screening for CRC yielded detection of an increasingly younger adults. However, current machine learning algorithms that are trained using older adults and smaller datasets, may not perform well in practice for large populations.AimTo evaluate machine learning algorithms using large datasets accounting for both younger and older adults from multiple regions and diverse sociodemographics.MethodsA large dataset including 109,343 participants in a dietary-based colorectal cancer ase study from Canada, India, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States was collected by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This global dietary database was augmented with other publicly accessible information from multiple sources. Nine supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms were evaluated on the aggregated dataset.ResultsBoth supervised and unsupervised models performed well in predicting CRC and non-CRC phenotypes. A prediction model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) was found to be the optimal algorithm with CRC misclassification of 1% and non-CRC misclassification of 3%.ConclusionsANN models trained on large heterogeneous datasets may be applicable for both younger and older adults. Such models provide a solid foundation for building effective clinical decision support systems assisting healthcare providers in dietary-related, non-invasive screening that can be applied in large studies.

,,"The worldwide efforts that healthcare professionals are making in the COVID-19 pandemic is well known, and the high risk of illness and death that front-line staff experience on a daily basis is a reality, despite well-defined protocols for the use of personal protective equipment. In addition, it is well known that vaccination is still faraway to be achieved worldwide and that new variants are emerging, thus additional protective measures must be explored. A prospective open-label randomized controlled clinical trial was performed on front-line medical staff from the Dr. Enrique Cabrera General Hospital in Mexico City to evaluate the effectiveness of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal rinses with a neutral electrolyzed water, known as SES, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease among front-line, not vaccinated medical staff. A total of 170 volunteers were enrolled and equally divided in a control group and SES group. All members of the trial wore the adequate personal protection equipment at all times while performing their duties, as required by standard COVID-19 safety protocols. Additionally, the SES group participants followed a prophylactic protocol with SES (oral and nasal rinses, three times a day for 4 weeks). All participants were monitored for COVID-19 symptoms and disease in a time-frame of 4 weeks and the incidence of illness per group was registered. The relative risk of disease, associated with each treatment was calculated. The presence of COVID-19-positive cases, in the group that received the nasal and oral rinses with SES was 1.2%, while in the group that did not do the SES rinses (control group), it was 12.7% (P=0.0039 and RR=0.09405; 95% CI of 0.01231-0.7183). The prophylactic protocol was demonstrated as a protective factor, in more than 90%, for developing the disease, and without adverse effects. Nasal and oral rinses with SES may be an efficient alternative to reinforce the protective measures against COVID-19 disease and should be further investigated. The present clinical trial was retrospectively registered in the Cuban public registry of clinical trials (RPCEC) database (March 16, 2021; PREVECOVID-19: RPCEC00000357).","Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal rinses with neutral electrolyzed water prevents COVID-19 in front-line health professionals: A randomized, open-label, controlled trial in a general hospital in Mexico City","Gutierrez-Garcia, R., De La Cerda-Angeles, J.C., Cabrera-Licona, A., Delgado-Enciso, I., Mervitch-Sigal, N., Paz-Michel, B.A.",2022,BIOMEDICAL REPORTS,16,2,11,,,8.0,5.0,10.3892/br.2021.1494,,"[Gutierrez-Garcia, Rafael] Dr Enrique Cabrera Gen Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Mexico City 01620, DF, Mexico; [De La Cerda-Angeles, Juan C.] Dr Enrique Cabrera Gen Hosp, Dept Med Direct, Mexico City 01620, DF, Mexico; [Cabrera-Licona, Ariana; Paz-Michel, Brenda A.] Esteripharma SA CV, Dept Res & Ind Property, Estado De Mexico 50450, Mexico; [Delgado-Enciso, Ivan; Paz-Michel, Brenda A.] Univ Colima, Sch Med, Dept Mol Med, Colima 28040, Mexico; [Delgado-Enciso, Ivan] Colima State Hlth Serv, Cancerol State Inst, Colima 28085, Mexico; [Mervitch-Sigal, Nicolas] Esteripharma Mexico SA CV, Dept Med Direct, Mexico City 03100, DF, Mexico",,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; neutral electrolyzed water; nasal rinses; mouthwashes; prophylaxis,,COVID-19;SARS-CoV-2;neutral electrolyzed water;nasal rinses;mouthwashes;prophylaxis,bpaz@esteripharma.com.mx,,"POB 18179, ATHENS, 116 10, GREECE",,,,SPANDIDOS PUBL LTD,2049-9434,,,34987795.0,English,BIOMED REP,Article,WoS,Research & Experimental Medicine,WOS:000741544000001,2-s2.0-85122295857,Mexico,esteripharma.com.mx,Dr Enrique Cabrera Gen Hosp;Esteripharma SA CV;Univ Colima;Colima State Hlth Serv;Esteripharma Mexico SA CV,"Dr Enrique Cabrera Gen Hosp, Mexico;Esteripharma SA CV, Mexico;Univ Colima, Mexico;Colima State Hlth Serv, Mexico;Esteripharma Mexico SA CV, Mexico","Gutierrez-Garcia, Rafael; De La Cerda-Angeles, Juan C.; Cabrera-Licona, Ariana; Delgado-Enciso, Ivan; Mervitch-Sigal, Nicolas; Paz-Michel, Brenda A.",263.0,
,,"Background: A growing number of studies have explored how features of the neighbourhood environment can be related to cognitive health in later life. Yet few have focused on low- and middle-income countries and compared the results across different settings. The aim of this study is to investigate the cross-sectional associations between neighbourhood amenities and dementia in older people from high-, middle- and low-income countries. Methods: This study was based on two population-based cohort studies of people aged≥65: the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II (CFAS II) in UK (N = 4955) and a subset of the 10/66 study in China, Dominican Republic and Mexico (N = 3386). In both cohorts, dementia was assessed using the Geriatric Mental State-Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy (GMS-AGECAT) algorithm. The 10/66 dementia diagnostic algorithm was also used as an additional criterion in the 10/66 study. Publicly accessible databases, Google Maps and Open Street Map, were used to obtain geographic information system data on distance to neighbourhood amenities, including lifestyle (cafés, libraries, movie theatres, parks), daily life (post offices, convenience stores), healthcare (hospitals, pharmacies) and percentages of local green and blue spaces within 400 and 800 m of participants' residences. Multilevel logistic regression was used to investigate the associations between these environmental features and dementia adjusting for sociodemographic factors and self-rated health. Results: Living far from daily life amenities was associated with higher odds of dementia in both CFAS II (1.47; 95% CI: 0.96, 2.24) and the 10/66 study (1.53; 95% CI: 1.15, 2.04), while living far from lifestyle (1.50; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.99) and healthcare amenities (1.32; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.87) was associated with higher odds of dementia only in the 10/66 study. A high availability of local green and blue spaces was not associated with dementia in either cohort yet living far from public parks was associated with lower odds of dementia in CFAS II (0.64; 95% CI: 0.41, 1.00). Conclusions: The different relationships across cohorts may indicate a varying role for local amenities in diverse settings. Future research may investigate mechanisms related to these differences and social, cultural and historical influences on the interaction between neighbourhood amenities and older people. © 2020 The Author(s).","Neighbourhood environment and dementia in older people from high-, middle- And low-income countries: Results from two population-based cohort studies","Wu Y.T., Brayne C., Liu Z., Huang Y., Sosa A.L., Acosta D., Prina M.",2020,BMC Public Health,20,1,1330,,,,18.0,10.1186/s12889-020-09435-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090181683&doi=10.1186%2fs12889-020-09435-5&partnerID=40&md5=e79e1386bf4b30080bbd17a6bb1af9b9,"Department of Health Service and Population Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, David Goldberg Centre, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, United Kingdom; Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0SR, United Kingdom; Peking University Sixth Hospital, Peking University Institute of Mental Health, Nhc Key Laboratory of Mental Health (Peking University), National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders (Peking University Sixth Hospital), Beijing, China; National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery of Mexico, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico; Internal Medicine Department, Geriatric Section, Universidad Nacional Pedro Henriquez Ureña (UNPHU), Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; King's Global Health Institute, King's College London, London, SE5 8AF, United Kingdom","Wu Y.-T., Department of Health Service and Population Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, David Goldberg Centre, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, United Kingdom; Brayne C., Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0SR, United Kingdom; Liu Z., Peking University Sixth Hospital, Peking University Institute of Mental Health, Nhc Key Laboratory of Mental Health (Peking University), National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders (Peking University Sixth Hospital), Beijing, China; Huang Y., Peking University Sixth Hospital, Peking University Institute of Mental Health, Nhc Key Laboratory of Mental Health (Peking University), National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders (Peking University Sixth Hospital), Beijing, China; Sosa A.L., National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery of Mexico, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico; Acosta D., Internal Medicine Department, Geriatric Section, Universidad Nacional Pedro Henriquez Ureña (UNPHU), Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; Prina M., Department of Health Service and Population Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, David Goldberg Centre, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, United Kingdom, King's Global Health Institute, King's College London, London, SE5 8AF, United Kingdom",Built environment; Dementia; Epidemiological cohorts; Geographic information system; Green and blue spaces; Local amenities; Older people,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; China; Cognition; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dementia; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Dominican Republic; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Mexico; Residence Characteristics; Social Environment; United Kingdom; aged; China; cognition; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; dementia; dementia assessment; demography; developing country; Dominican Republic; female; geriatric assessment; human; male; Mexico; social environment; statistical model; United Kingdom; very elderly","Built environment;Dementia;Epidemiological cohorts;Geographic information system;Green and blue spaces;Local amenities;Older people;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;China;Cognition;Cohort Studies;Cross-Sectional Studies;Developed Countries;Developing Countries;Dominican Republic;Female;Geriatric Assessment;Humans;Logistic Models;Male;Mental Status and Dementia Tests;Mexico;Residence Characteristics;Social Environment;United Kingdom;cohort analysis;cross-sectional study;dementia assessment;demography;developing country;human;statistical model;very elderly","Y.-T.

,,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) CoastWatch/OceanWatchPolarWatch (a.k.a. 'CoastWatch') aims to improve decision outcomes by facilitating the use of ocean satellite data in applications and research for understanding, managing and protecting ocean, coastal and inland water resources and for assessing impacts of environmental change in ecosystems, human health, weather, and climate. Earth observations from space have the advantage of broad spatial and repeating temporal coverage that complement in situ measurements.. CoastWatch satellite data products are free and open (publicly available without the need for registration), and include multiple environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature, ocean color (e.g. chlorophyll), sea surface height (altimetry), ocean winds, surface roughness (synthetic aperture radar), salinity and sea ice. CoastWatch also distributes outputs from environmental models which incorporate several of these basic physical parameters to derive more complex information. These products cover multiple spatial regions (global and regional coverage) and near real-time as well as delayed-mode, higher quality and longer term time series datasets. CoastWatch customizes, serves, and monitors ocean satellite data products from NOAA and other environmental satellite missions. CoastWatch is well positioned to link upstream ocean satellite data producers with downstream user needs for real life applications. Our central 'hub' is colocated with the ocean satellite data scientists in College Park, MD and our 'spokes' are our seven regional Nodes distributed geographically around the country and across NOAA mission line offices. Our Gulf of Mexico Node is co-located with the NOAA Office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research, in the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (NOAA/OAR/AOML) in Miami, FL. Our Central Pacific Ocean Watch Node is co-located with the National Marine Fisheries Service at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (NOAA/NMFS/PIFSC). CoastWatch operates 1) interactive and interoperable data portals to facilitate search and discovery, multi-product visualization and customizable data downloading; 2) a central helpdesk which responds to everything from educating and guiding novice users, help with discovering data products for specific applications, code suggestions to setup routine queries and downloads, etc.; 3) routine data quality and availability services that enable the assessment of data products over time and in comparison with reference datasets; 4) in-person training courses along with evolving online tutorial and virtual training opportunities. CoastWatch Utilities is a software package that helps users analyze and visualize satellite data products on their own. Coastwatch also collaborates directly with users to provide satellite data expertise in the development of applications that solve user-specific problems. Some examples and short demonstrations of data products, discovery and access pathways, tutorials and several user applications will be presented with an emphasis on our Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and our Central Pacific products, services and application tools.

,,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey was to assess the evaluation, management, and future recommendations of patients with the diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy and to evaluate the interest in the creation of a prospective database regarding this rare disorder. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 116 surveys were sent to major teaching institutions in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Crete, and South Korea after a national conference held at the National Institutes of Health regarding peripartum cardiomyopathy. This was an open-ended survey containing 17 specific questions regarding this disorder and its management. RESULTS: A total of 78 (67%) maternal-fetal specialists responded to the survey. Diuretics and digoxin were used as first-line treatment for this disorder. Only 6% used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during pregnancy. Fifty-eight percent of the perinatologists (58%) recommended either intrauterine contraceptive devices or foam and condoms, whereas oral contraceptives (progesterone-only pill or estrogen-progesterone mix) were recommended in 23% and 41%, respectively. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the respondents would recommend future pregnancy if ventricular function returned to normal. CONCLUSIONS: Fundamental clinical and basic research is lacking regarding this rare but potentially devastating disorder. Major teaching institutions do not have significant numbers of patients with this disorder to provide concrete recommendations, and starting a database will be useful in the gathering of important epidemiologic information. A secondary aim of such a registry would be to establish a repository for tissue and blood samples to answer basic mechanistic questions about this disorder.",Peripartum cardiomyopathy: Summary of an international survey on peripartum cardiomyopathy,"Veille, J.C., Zaccaro, D.",1999,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY,181,2,,315,319,5.0,32.0,10.1016/S0002-9378(99)70554-5,,"Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA",,peripartum cardiomyopathy; congestive heart failure,IDIOPATHIC DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY; HEART-FAILURE; CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION; MYOCARDITIS; ENALAPRIL,peripartum cardiomyopathy;congestive heart failure;IDIOPATHIC DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY;HEART-FAILURE;CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION;MYOCARDITIS;ENALAPRIL,,,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318 USA",61st Annual Meeting of the South-Atlantic-Association-of-Obstetricians-and-Gynecologists,"WHITE SULFUR SPRINGS, WEST VIRGINIA","JAN 23-26, 1999",MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,0002-9378,,,10454675.0,English,AM J OBSTET GYNECOL,Article; Proceedings Paper,WoS,Obstetrics & Gynecology,WOS:000082161300026,2-s2.0-0032840811,United States,No email,Sch Med,"Sch Med, United States","Veille, JC; Zaccaro, D",286.0,

The latter application includes for paternity testing and DNA profiling of samples collected from scenes of crime and suspects. This survey provides the first dataset for 21 STR loci across the Akan population in Ghana by genotyping of 109 unrelated healthy individuals using Investigator 24plex kit. None of the STR loci screened deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after applying Bonferroni correction. Overall, 224 unique alleles were observed with allele frequencies ranging from 0.005 to 0.518. The combined match probability, combined power of exclusion and combined power discrimination were 1 in 4.07 x 10(-25), 0.999999999 and 1, respectively.

,,"Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with only symptomatic treatments currently available. Although correct, early diagnoses of PD are important, the existing diagnostic method based on pathologic examinations only has an accuracy of approximately 80.6%. Although electroencephalography (EEG)-based assistive technology has been introduced, it has been difficult to implement in practice due to the high computational complexity and low accuracy of the analysis methods. This study proposed a fast, accurate PD prediction method using the Hjorth parameter and the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm. Method: We used an open EEG dataset with 41 PD patients and 41 healthy controls (HCs); EEG signals were recorded from participants at the University of New Mexico (PD: 27 vs. HC: 27) and University of Iowa (PD: 14 vs. HC: 14). We explored the analytic time segment and frequency range in which the Hjorth parameter best represents the EEG characteristics of PD patients. Results: Our best model (CatBoost-based) distinguished PD patients from controls with an accuracy of 89.3%, an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.912, an F-score of 0.903, and an odds ratio of 115.5. These results showed that our models outperformed those of all other previous works and were even superior to previously known pathologic examination-based diagnoses with long-term follow-up (accuracy = 83.9%). Conclusion: The proposed methods are expected to be utilized as an effective method for improving the diagnosis of PD.",Predicting Parkinson's disease using gradient boosting decision tree models with electroencephalography signals,"Lee, S.B., Kim, Y.J., Hwang, S., Son, H., Lee, S.K., Park, K.I., Kim, Y.G.",2022,PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS,95,,,77,85,9.0,12.0,10.1016/j.parkreldis.2022.01.011,,"[Lee, Seung-Bo] Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Off Hosp Informat, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Yong-Jeong; Kim, Young-Gon] Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Transdisciplinary Dept Med & Adv Technol, 101 Daehak Ro, Seoul 03080, South Korea; [Hwang, Sungeun] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Neurol, Mokdong Hosp, Seoul, South Korea; [Son, Hyoshin; Lee, Sang Kun] Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Kyung-Il] Seoul Natl Univ Hosp Healthcare Syst, Dept Neurol, Gangnam Ctr, 152 Teheran Ro, Seoul 06236, South Korea; [Park, Kyung-Il] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Neurol, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Young-Gon] Seoul Natl Univ, AI Inst, Seoul, South Korea",,Parkinson 's disease; Electroencephalography; Hjorth parameter; Gradient boosting decision tree,CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; MOVEMENTS,Parkinson 's disease;Electroencephalography;Hjorth parameter;Gradient boosting decision tree;CLASSIFICATION;DIAGNOSIS;MOVEMENTS,koreateam23@gmail.com; somedaytobegood@gmail.com; neurosung@gmail.com; hson727@gmail.com; sangkun2923@gmail.com; ideopki@gmail.com; younggon2.kim@gmail.com,,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,1353-8020,,,35051896.0,English,PARKINSONISM RELAT D,Article,WoS,Neurosciences & Neurology,WOS:000749847700015,2-s2.0-85123071904,South Korea,gmail.com,Seoul Natl Univ Hosp;Ewha Womans Univ;Seoul Natl Univ Hosp Healthcare Syst;Seoul Natl Univ,"Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, South Korea;Ewha Womans Univ, South Korea;Seoul Natl Univ Hosp Healthcare Syst, South Korea;Seoul Natl Univ, South Korea","Lee, Seung-Bo; Kim, Yong-Jeong; Hwang, Sungeun; Son, Hyoshin; Lee, Sang Kun; Park, Kyung-Il; Kim, Young-Gon",292.0,
,,"Mathematical models can provide key insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic, potentially aiding real-time emergency management in allocating health care resources and by anticipating the impact of alternative interventions. We study the ex post reliability of predictions of the 2010-2011 Haiti cholera outbreak from four independent modeling studies that appeared almost simultaneously during the unfolding epidemic. We consider the impact of different approaches to the modeling of spatial spread of Vibrio cholerae and mechanisms of cholera transmission, accounting for the dynamics of susceptible and infected individuals within different local human communities. To explain resurgences of the epidemic, we go on to include waning immunity and a mechanism explicitly accounting for rainfall as a driver of enhanced disease transmission. The formal comparative analysis is carried out via the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to measure the added information provided by each process modeled, discounting for the added parameters. A generalized model for Haitian epidemic cholera and the related uncertainty is thus proposed and applied to the year-long dataset of reported cases now available. The model allows us to draw predictions on longer-term epidemic cholera in Haiti from multiseason Monte Carlo runs, carried out up to January 2014 by using suitable rainfall fields forecasts. Lessons learned and open issues are discussed and placed in perspective. We conclude that, despite differences in methods that can be tested through model-guided field validation, mathematical modeling of large-scale outbreaks emerges as an essential component of future cholera epidemic control.",Reassessment of the 2010-2011 Haiti cholera outbreak and rainfall-driven multiseason projections,"Rinaldo, A., Bertuzzo, E., Mari, L., Righetto, L., Blokesch, M., Gatto, M., Casagrandi, R., Murray, M., Vesenbeckh, S.M., Rodriguez-Iturbe, I.",2012,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,109,17,,6602,6607,6.0,130.0,10.1073/pnas.1203333109,,"[Rodriguez-Iturbe, Ignacio] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Rinaldo, Andrea; Bertuzzo, Enrico; Mari, Lorenzo; Righetto, Lorenzo; Gatto, Marino] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Lab Ecohydrol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Blokesch, Melanie] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Global Hlth Inst, Mol Microbiol Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Rinaldo, Andrea] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Edile & Ambientale, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Gatto, Marino; Casagrandi, Renato] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron & Informaz, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Murray, Megan; Vesenbeckh, Silvan M.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,waterborne diseases; epidemiology; ecohydrology; human mobility; Markov chain Monte Carlo,VIBRIO-CHOLERAE; TRANSMISSION MODEL; EPIDEMIC CHOLERA; ENDEMIC CHOLERA; CLIMATE; DISEASE; INFECTION; DYNAMICS; IMMUNITY; SPREAD,waterborne diseases;epidemiology;ecohydrology;human mobility;Markov chain Monte Carlo;VIBRIO-CHOLERAE;TRANSMISSION MODEL;EPIDEMIC CHOLERA;ENDEMIC CHOLERA;CLIMATE;DISEASE;INFECTION;DYNAMICS;IMMUNITY;SPREAD,irodrigu@princeton.edu,,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",,,,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,0027-8424,,,22505737.0,English,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Article,WoS,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000303249100055,2-s2.0-84860212349,United States;Switzerland;Italy,princeton.edu,Princeton Univ;Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne;Univ Padua;Politecn Milan;Harvard Univ,"Princeton Univ, United States;Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Switzerland;Univ Padua, Italy;Politecn Milan, Italy;Harvard Univ, United States","Rinaldo, Andrea; Bertuzzo, Enrico; Mari, Lorenzo; Righetto, Lorenzo; Blokesch, Melanie; Gatto, Marino; Casagrandi, Renato; Murray, Megan; Vesenbeckh, Silvan M.; Rodriguez-Iturbe, Ignacio",311.0,
,,"Objective: To describe national, state-specific, and sociodemographic trends in diagnoses of depressive disorders recorded during delivery hospitalizations. Methods: Data were analyzed from the National Inpatient Sample (2000-2015) and 31 publicly available State Inpatient Databases (2000-2015) of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Delivery hospitalizations were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic and procedure codes for obstetric delivery. Depressive disorders were identified from ICD-9-CM diagnoses codes classified as depressive disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (291.89, 292.84, 293.83, 296.2-296.26, 296.3-296.36, 300.4, and 311). Prevalence rates and average annual rate change were calculated nationally and across 28 states with at least 3 years of data and age, payer source, and race or ethnicity. Results: The U.S. rate of depressive disorders recorded during delivery hospitalizations increased from 4.1 diagnoses per 1,000 hospitalizations in 2000 to 28.7 in 2015. Rates significantly increased in 27 of the 28 states. Recent (2014-2015) rates were lowest in Hawaii and Nevada (less than 14/1,000) and highest in Vermont, Minnesota, Oregon, and Wisconsin (greater than 49/1,000). Rates in 2015 were highest among those aged 35 years or older, public insurance recipients, and non-Hispanic white women (greater than 31/1,000). The highest annual rate increases were in Vermont and Maine (3.8/1,000 or greater). Non-Hispanic white women, those 35 years of age or older, and public insurance recipients showed the highest annual rate increases during 2000-2015 (1.7/1,000 or greater). Conclusion: During 2000-2015, rates of depressive disorders recorded during delivery hospitalizations increased nationally, in 27 states with available data, and across all sociodemographic categories. © 2019 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.","Recorded Diagnoses of Depression During Delivery Hospitalizations in the United States, 2000-2015","Haight S.C., Byatt N., Moore Simas T.A., Robbins C.L., Ko J.Y.",2019,Obstetrics and Gynecology,133,6,,1216,1223,7.0,21.0,10.1097/AOG.0000000000003291,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067021665&doi=10.1097%2fAOG.0000000000003291&partnerID=40&md5=93597813d04a54f47cf53951c1e95104,"Division of Reproductive Health National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Atlanta Georgia; the University of Massachusetts Medical School UMass Memorial Health Care Worcester Massachusetts; and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Rockville Maryland.; 4770 Buford Hwy, MS-F74, Atlanta, 30341, GA, United States","Haight S.C., Division of Reproductive Health National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Atlanta Georgia; the University of Massachusetts Medical School UMass Memorial Health Care Worcester Massachusetts; and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Rockville Maryland., 4770 Buford Hwy, MS-F74, Atlanta, 30341, GA, United States; Byatt N., Division of Reproductive Health National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Atlanta Georgia; the University of Massachusetts Medical School UMass Memorial Health Care Worcester Massachusetts; and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Rockville Maryland.; Moore Simas T.A., Division of Reproductive Health National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Atlanta Georgia; the University of Massachusetts Medical School UMass Memorial Health Care Worcester Massachusetts; and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Rockville Maryland.; Robbins C.L., Division of Reproductive Health National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Atlanta Georgia; the University of Massachusetts Medical School UMass Memorial Health Care Worcester Massachusetts; and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Rockville Maryland.; Ko J.Y., Division of Reproductive Health National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Atlanta Georgia; the University of Massachusetts Medical School UMass Memorial Health Care Worcester Massachusetts; and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Rockville Maryland.",,"Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Databases, Factual; Delivery, Obstetric; Depressive Disorder; Ethnic Groups; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prevalence; United States; Young Adult; adult; age; Arizona; Arkansas; Article; California; Caucasian; Colorado; data base; District of Columbia; DSM-5; ethnicity; female; Florida; Georgia (U.S.); Hawaii; hospitalization; human; ICD-9-CM; Iowa; Kentucky; Maine; major clinical study; Maryland; Massachusetts; Michigan; Minnesota; Mississippi; Nebraska; Nevada; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; North Carolina; obstetric delivery; Oregon; postnatal depression; prevalence; priority journal; psychiatric diagnosis; public health insurance; race; Rhode Island; South Carolina; South Dakota; trend study; Utah; Vermont; Washington; West Virginia; Wisconsin; adolescent; depression; ethnic group; factual database; hospitalization; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; United States; young adult","Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Databases, Factual;Delivery, Obstetric;Depressive Disorder;Ethnic Groups;Female;Hospitalization;Humans;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications;Prevalence;United States;Young Adult;age;Arizona;Arkansas;Article;California;Caucasian;Colorado;data base;District of Columbia;DSM-5;ethnicity;Florida;Georgia (U.S.);Hawaii;human;ICD-9-CM;Iowa;Kentucky;Maine;major clinical study;Maryland;Massachusetts;Michigan;Minnesota;Mississippi;Nebraska;Nevada;New Jersey;New Mexico;New York;North Carolina;obstetric delivery;Oregon;postnatal depression;priority journal;psychiatric diagnosis;public health insurance;race;Rhode Island;South Carolina;South Dakota;trend study;Utah;Vermont;Washington;West Virginia;Wisconsin;depression;ethnic group;factual database;pregnancy complication","S.C.

,,"Introduction and objectives: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by a germline mutation of the STK11/LKB1 gene, located on chromosome 19p13.3. It is characterized by mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation, hamartomatous polyposis, and predisposition to cancer. The aim of the present study was to identify and register patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, describe the disease, and estimate its prevalence in Valencia (Spain). Materials and methods: A print-out of the clinical histories from 10 hospitals was obtained utilizing the ICD-9 code 759.6 from the Minimum Basic Data Set of Hospital Admissions of the Spanish Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs. Results: From a total of 405 clinical histories found, 15 (9 males and 6 females) fit the diagnostic criteria of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Mean age at diagnosis was 13.8 years and mean age at death was 54.2 years. Four males died, all from cancer. The estimated disease prevalence was 0.4/100,000 inhabitants. All the patients presented with anemia and polyps in the small bowel (80% in the duodenum, 66.7% in the ileum, and 40% in the jejunum), 93.3% underwent urgent surgical intervention and presented with intestinal invagination, and 40% of the patients developed cancer at a mean age of 48.5 years. Conclusion: The present study is the first register of patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome in Valencia, Spain. The ICD-9 code is nonspecific for rare diseases. The duodenum was the most frequent location for polyps and the majority of cases presented with intestinal invagination, bowel obstruction, and urgent surgical intervention. A large percentage of patients presented with cancer. It would be of interest to review and evaluate the existing surveillance protocols in the Valencian Community. 2019 Asociacion Mexicana de Gastroenterologia. Published by Masson Doyma Mexico S.A.

,,"Modern availability of rich geospatial datasets and analysis tools can provide insight germane to the design of field experiments. Design of field experiments, and in particular the choice of sampling strategy, requires careful consideration of its consequences on the external representativity and interference (SUTVA violations) of the experimental sample. This paper presents a methodology for a) modeling the geospatial and social interaction factors that drive interference in rural field experiments; and b) eliciting a set of nondominated sample options that approximate the Pareto-optimal tradeoff between interference and external representativity, as functions of sample choice. The study develops and tests the methodology in the context of a large-scale health experiment in rural Mexico, involving more than 3,000 pregnant women and 600 health clinics across 5 states. Relevant for the practitioner, the methodology is computationally tractable and can be implemented leveraging open sourced geo-spatial data and software tools. © 2020 The Author(s).

,,"Objectives Understanding trends of marijuana use in the USA throughout a period of particularly high adoption of marijuana-legalisation, and understanding demographics most at risk of use, is important in evolving healthcare policy and intervention. This study analyses the demographic-specific changes in the prevalence of marijuana use in the USA between 2005 and 2018. Design, setting and participants A 14-year retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database, a publicly available biennially collected national survey, weighted to represent the entire US population. A total of 35 212 adults between 18 and 69 years old participated in the seven-cycles of surveys analysed (2005-2018). Primary outcome measured Lifetime use, first use before 18 years old, and past-year use of marijuana. Results The majority of adults reported ever using marijuana. While the overall prevalence of lifetime marijuana use remained stable (p=0.53), past-year use increased significantly between 2005 and 2018 (p<0.001) with highest rate of past-year use among younger age groups (p<0.001), males (p<0.001) and those with income below poverty level (p<0.001). Past-year use was the most common among non-Hispanic blacks, and less common among Hispanic/Mexican populations (p<0.002). Trends in past-year use increased among all age categories, males/females, all ethnicities, those with high school education/above, and those at all income levels (p<0.01 for all). Conclusions While lifetime marijuana use remained stable, past-year use significantly increased between 2005 and 2018. While past-year use remained the most common in younger age groups, males, non-Hispanic blacks and those with lower income; increasing trends in past-year use were significant for all age, sex, race and income categories, and for those with high school education/above. With high adoption of marijuana-legalisation laws during this period, our results suggest an associated increase in past-year marijuana use. An accurate understanding of those most at risk can help to inform decisions of healthcare policy-makers and professionals, and facilitate a safe transition of changing marijuana legalisation and use in the USA.","Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the changes in marijuana use in the USA, 2005-2018","Mitchell, W., Bhatia, R., Zebardast, N.",2020,BMJ OPEN,10,7,e037905,,,6.0,7.0,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-037905,,"[Mitchell, William] Harvard Univ, Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bhatia, Roma] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zebardast, Nazlee] Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirm, Dept Ophthalmol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Zebardast, Nazlee] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Ophthalmol, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,UNITED-STATES; USE DISORDERS; CANNABIS; PREVALENCE; WASHINGTON; LEGALIZATION; COLORADO; ALCOHOL; PRICES; MARKET,UNITED-STATES;USE DISORDERS;CANNABIS;PREVALENCE;WASHINGTON;LEGALIZATION;COLORADO;ALCOHOL;PRICES;MARKET,william.greig.mitchell@gmail.com,,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",,,,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,2044-6055,,,32723745.0,English,BMJ OPEN,Article,WoS,General & Internal Medicine,WOS:000738473700062,,United States,gmail.com,Harvard Univ;Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr;Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirm;Harvard Med Sch,"Harvard Univ, United States;Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, United States;Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirm, United States;Harvard Med Sch, United States","Mitchell, William; Bhatia, Roma; Zebardast, Nazlee",320.0,
,,"Objective To describe the epidemiology and risk factors for hospitalisation and death in Mexican children under 18 years of age with COVID-19. Design Retrospective, cross-sectional and analytical study. Setting Mexican Ministry of Health open databases with COVID-19 cases occurred from 7 March 2020 to 30 September 2021. Participants Mexican children under 18 years of age with COVID-19. Main outcome measures COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths were characterised by age group, sex, presence of pneumonia and comorbidities, intubation and intensive care unit admission, and institution that provided medical care. Cumulative incidence, mortality, case fatality rates and ORs for hospitalisation and death were estimated by age group. Results 5.5% (204 641) of national COVID-19 cases were children under 18 years of age: 2.9% under 1 year, 12.5% from 1 to 5 years, 15% from 6 to 9 years and 69.4% from 10 to 17 years. 4.6% of all cases were hospitalised, from which 54.6% were male, 35.3% were children under 1 year old, 39.6% were adolescents and 34% had pneumonia. Pneumonia developed in 2.3% of cases, from which 50% were adolescents. Case fatality rate was higher in children less than 1 year old (4.2%). Risk analyses showed that male sex (OR 1.16-1.28), history of pneumonia (OR 29.7-65.4), immunosuppression (OR 5.3-42.9), cardiovascular disease (OR 4.4-14.6) and other comorbidities (OR 5.4-19.1), as well as age less than 1 year (OR 20.1, 95% CI 18.8 to 21.4), confer a greater risk of hospitalisation; in addition to comorbidities, age less than 1 year (OR 16.6, 95% CI 14.1 to 19.6), history of pneumonia (OR 14.1-135.1) and being an adolescent from an indigenous community (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.23 to 5.54, p=0.012) increase the risk of death. Conclusions In Mexico, children less than 1 year old with COVID-19 have higher risk of hospitalisation and death than older children.

,,"Objectives: To describe the association between chronic noncommunicable diseases and age with hospitalization, death and severe clinical outcomes for COVID-19 in confirmed cases within the mexican population, comparing the first three epidemiological waves of the pandemic in Mexico.Design: We performed an analysis using Mexico's Government Epidemiological Surveillance Sys-tem database for COVID-19. Emplacement: Mexico's Epidemiological Surveillance System for Respiratory Diseases.Participants: Mexican population confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 registered on Mexico's Epidemio-logical Surveillance System for Respiratory Diseases.Primary measurements: The analysed severe outcomes were hospitalization, pneumonia, use of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission and death. The association (odds ratio) between the outcomes and clinical variables was evaluated, comparing the three epidemiolo-gical waves in Mexico.Results: Age over 65 is associated with a higher ratio of hospitalization and pneumonia, inde-pendent of the effect of chronic comorbidities. There is an interaction between age and obesity, which is associated with hospitalization, pneumonia and highly associated with death. These findings were consistent throughout the three epidemiological waves.Conclusion: Obesity, COPD and diabetes in interaction with age, are associated with worse clinical outcomes and, more importantly, death in patients with COVID-19.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

,,"COVID-19 is a viral infection that affects people differently, where the majority of cases develop mild symptoms, some people require hospitalization, and unfortunately, a small number of patients perish. Hence, identifying risk factors is critical for physicians to make treatment decisions. The purpose of this article is to determine whether unsupervised analysis of risk factors in positive and negative COVID-19 subjects can aid in the identification of a set of reliable and clinically relevant risk profiles. Positive and negative patients hospitalized were randomly selected from the Mexican Open Registry between March and May 2020. Thirteen risk factors, three distinct outcomes, and COVID-19 test results were used to categorize registry patients. As a result, the dataset was reported via 6144 different risk profiles for each age group. The unsupervised learning method is proposed in this study to discover the most prevalent risk profiles. The data was partitioned into discovery (70%) and validation (30%) sets. The discovery set was analyzed using the partition around medoids (PAM) method, and the stable set of risk profiles was estimated using robust consensus clustering. The PAM models' reliability was validated by predicting the risk profile of subjects from the validation set and patients admitted in November 2020. In the validation set, the clinical relevance of the risk profiles was evaluated by determining the prevalence of three patient outcomes: pneumonia diagnosis, ICU admission, or death. Six positive and five negative COVID19 risk profiles were identified, with significant statistical differences between them. As a result, PAM clustering with consensus mapping is a viable method for discovering unsupervised risk profiles in subjects with severe respiratory health problems.",Risk profiles for negative and positive COVID-19 hospitalized patients,"Nezhadmoghadam, F., Tamez-Pena, J.",2021,COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,136,,104753,,,9.0,2.0,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104753,,"[Nezhadmoghadam, Fahimeh; Tamez-Pena, Jose] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Med, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico",,Consensus clustering; COVID-19; Cluster analysis; Decision trees; Reproducibility of results; Risk factors; Unsupervised machine learning,,Consensus clustering;COVID-19;Cluster analysis;Decision trees;Reproducibility of results;Risk factors;Unsupervised machine learning,f.nejad.moghadam@gmail.com,,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",,,,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,0010-4825,,,34411902.0,English,COMPUT BIOL MED,Article,WoS,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Computer Science; Engineering; Mathematical & Computational Biology,WOS:000696935800001,,Mexico,gmail.com,Tecnol Monterrey,"Tecnol Monterrey, Mexico","Nezhadmoghadam, Fahimeh; Tamez-Pena, Jose",326.0,
,,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently the major public health problem worldwide. Neutral electrolyzed saline solution that contains reactive chlorine and oxygen species may be an effective therapeutic. In the present study, the treatment efficacy of intravenous and/or nebulized neutral electrolyzed saline combined with usual medical care vs. usual medical care alone was evaluated in ambulatory patients with COVID-19. A prospective, 2-arm, parallel-group, randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase I-II clinical trial including 214 patients was performed. The following two outcomes were evaluated during the 20-day follow-up: i) The number of patients with disease progression; and ii) the patient acceptable symptom state. Serial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 naso/oro-pharyngeal detection by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q) PCR was performed in certain patients of the experimental group. Biochemical and hematologic parameters, as well as adverse effects, were also evaluated in the experimental group. The experimental treatment decreased the risk of hospitalization by 89% [adjusted relative risk (RR)=0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03-0.37, P<0.001] and the risk of death by 96% (adjusted RR=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.42, P=0.007) and also resulted in an 18-fold higher probability of achieving an acceptable symptom state on day 5 (adjusted RR=18.14, 95% CI: 7.29-45.09, P<0.001), compared with usual medical care alone. Overall, neutral electrolyzed saline solution was better than usual medical care alone. Of the patients analyzed, >50% were negative for the virus as detected by RT-qPCR in naso/oro-pharyngeal samples on day 4, with only a small number of positive patients on day 6. Clinical improvement correlated with a decrease in C-reactive protein, aberrant monocytes and increased lymphocytes and platelets. Cortisol and testosterone levels were also evaluated and a decrease in cortisol levels and an increase in the testosterone-cortisol ratio were observed on days 2 and 4. The experimental treatment produced no serious adverse effects. In conclusion, neutral electrolyzed saline solution markedly reduced the symptomatology and risk of progression in ambulatory patients with COVID-19. The present clinical trial was registered in the Cuban public registry of clinical trials (RPCEC) database (May 5, 2020; no.

,,"Objectives: This study aimed to identify and quantify the role that social and economic determinants play in the probability of dying from COVID-19, in the case of Mexico. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study based on secondary data. Methods: In this study, COVID-19 contagion and mortality data were used, as well as socio-economic variables, from public databases and open access, with which an econometric model was estimated. Results: It shows that the number of deaths can rise when variables related to vulnerable groups increase, such as poverty, lack of services, gender, and age. In addition, having pre-existing medical conditions or lacking access to water can be a significant factor in the increase in deaths. Conclusions: Therefore, this study suggests more policies be developed for vulnerable groups to reduce gaps in inequality, particularly given the current situation in which greater inequality can exacerbate the impact of a disease or an unforeseen situation, as is the case of COVID-19. © 2022 The Royal Society for Public Health",Socio-economic determinants of COVID-19 in Mexico,"Revollo-Fernandez D., Rodriguez-Tapia L., Medina-Rivas C., Morales-Novelo J.A.",2022,Public Health,207,,,28,30,2.0,2.0,10.1016/j.puhe.2022.03.011,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128999186&doi=10.1016%2fj.puhe.2022.03.011&partnerID=40&md5=f36090847a3c6b581a6c934a7ae8dc0a,"CONACYT-UAM, Área de Crecimiento y Medio Ambiente, Departamento de Economía, Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, Unidad Azcapotzalco, Av.

,,"In the jaragua-bahoruco-enriquillo biosphere reserve, located on the southern border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti, there are depressed rural areas with soils with high content in Cadmium and other heavy metals which originate naturally in the geological substrate. Data from 80 soils and an inventory of 76 plantations (coffee and kidney bean were used) to design a GIS (geographic information systems) tool which integrated statistical multivariate methods, soil parameters including heavy metal content into models of land planning, agricultural development, forests and protection of the health of the area's inhabitants and the natural environment. This GIS tool is based on raster models of an open source, which use combination and reclassification operations based on the maps, geostatistical methods (Kriging), statistical analyses external to the GIS, and cartography of limiting and excluding particular factors for crops (including heavy metal soil content).

,,"Charitable organizations may play a significant role in the delivery of surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, in order to quantify their collective contribution, to account for the care they provide in national surgical plans, and to maximize coordination between organizations, a comprehensive database of these groups is required. We aimed to create such a database using web-available data. We searched for organizations that meet the United Nations Rule of Law definition of non-governmental organizations and provide surgery in LMICs. We termed these surgical non-governmental organizations (s-NGOs). We screened multiple sources including a listing of disaster relief organizations, medical volunteerism databases, charity commissions, and the results of a literature search. We performed a secondary review of each eligible organization's website to verify inclusion criteria and extracted data. We found 403 s-NGOs providing surgery in all 139 LMICs, with most (61 %) incorporating surgery into a broader spectrum of health services. Over 80 % of s-NGOs had an office in the USA, the UK, Canada, India, or Australia, and they most commonly provided surgery in India (87 s-NGOs), Haiti (71), Kenya (60), and Ethiopia (55).

,,"BackgroundThe new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been relatively less lethal in children; however, poor prognosis and mortality has been associated with factors such as access to health services. Mexico remained on the list of the ten countries with the highest case fatality rate (CFR) in adults. It is of interest to know the behavior of COVID-19 in the pediatric population. The aim of this study was to identify clinical and sociodemographic variables associated with mortality due to COVID-19 in pediatric patients. ObjectiveUsing National open data and information from the Ministry of Health, Mexico, this cohort study aimed to identify clinical and sociodemographic variables associated with COVID-19 mortality in pediatric patients. MethodA cohort study was designed based on National open data from the Ministry of Health, Mexico, for the period April 2020 to January 2022, and included patients under 18 years of age with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Variables analyzed were age, health services used, and comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression, high blood pressure, and chronic kidney disease). Follow-up duration was 60 days, and primary outcomes were death, hospitalization, and requirement of intensive care. Statistical analysis included survival analysis, prediction models created using the Cox proportional hazards model, and Kaplan-Meier estimation curves. ResultsThe cohort included 261,099 cases with a mean age of 11.2 +/- 4 years, and of these, 11,569 (4.43%) were hospitalized and 1,028 (0.39%) died. Variables associated with risk of mortality were age under 12 months, the presence of comorbidities, health sector where they were treated, and first wave of infection. ConclusionBased on data in the National database, we show that the pediatric fatality rate due to SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that seen in other countries. Access to health services and distribution of mortality were heterogeneous.

We examined whether SLE is a leading cause of death in Mexico among females. Data for death counts for the female population were obtained from the General Board of Health Information (DGIS) Open Access datasets, which evaluate death certificates, from 2000 to 2020. SLE was defined using the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Disease codes: M32.1, M32.8, and M32.9. From 2000 to 2020, there were 12,114 deaths of females with SLE recorded as an underlying cause of death in Mexico. SLE ranked among the top 20 leading causes of death in females aged 10–54 years. SLE ranked fifteenth for deaths in people aged 15–24 years, sixteenth in those aged 25–34 years and 35–44 years, and eighteenth in those aged 45–54 years. After three frequent external injury causes of death were excluded from the analysis, focusing on the organic causes of death, SLE ranked twelfth in those aged 15–24 years and thirteenth in those aged 25–34 years and 35–44 years.

,,"Objective: To investigate national temporal trends over time in mortality rates in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) in Mexico between 1998 and 2017. Methods: Deaths between 1998 and 2017 were extracted from General Board of Health Information (DGIS) Open Access datasets. 2We identified all persons aged ≥15 years with a diagnosis of SSc (ICD-10 code M34). We calculated the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) for SSc and non-SSc (information provided by the National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Informatics). A Joinpoint regression model was used to determine mortality trends by sex and geographic regions. Annual percentage change (APC) and average APC (AAPC) were calculated using Joinpoint analysis. Results: From 1998 to 2017, the overall ASMR of SSc increased (AAPC = 2.5%), whereas the ASMR for non-SSc remained stable. By subpopulations, females, and males with SSc had a significant uptrend in the ASMR (APC = 4.6 and 4.4%, respectively), between 1998 and 2008 for the former and between 1998 and 2010 for the later. Females had a non-significant ASMR uptrend between 2008 and 2017 and males a non-significant ASMR decline between 2010 and 2017. Women had a higher SSc-ASMR to non-SSc-ASMR ratio than males. The relative cumulative change between 1998 and 2017 differed between females (78.1%) and males (50.8%), and residents of the Southern region had the largest cumulative change (147.8%). Conclusions: SSc mortality rate increased in Mexico between 1998 to 2017, with SSc mortality higher than non-SSc mortality. However, the SSc mortality rate steeply increased in the first ten years but has plateaued in the last 10 years of the study period.

,,"Background: Evidence on immunization costs is a critical input for cost-effectiveness analysis and budgeting, and can describe variation in site-level efficiency. The Expanded Program on Immunization Costing and Financing (EPIC) Project represents the largest investigation of immunization delivery costs, collecting empirical data on routine infant immunization in Benin, Ghana, Honduras, Moldova, Uganda, and Zambia. Methods: We developed a pooled dataset from individual EPIC country studies (316 sites). We regressed log total costs against explanatory variables describing service volume, quality, access, other site characteristics, and income level. We used Bayesian hierarchical regression models to combine data from different countries and account for the multi-stage sample design. We calculated output elasticity as the percentage increase in outputs (service volume) for a 1% increase in inputs (total costs), averaged across the sample in each country, and reported first differences to describe the impact of other predictors. We estimated average and total cost curves for each country as a function of service volume. Results: Across countries, average costs per dose ranged from $2.75 to $13.63. Average costs per child receiving diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis ranged from $27 to $139. Within countries costs per dose varied widely-on average, sites in the highest quintile were 440% more expensive than those in the lowest quintile. In each country, higher service volume was strongly associated with lower average costs. A doubling of service volume was associated with a 19% (95% interval, 4.0-32) reduction in costs per dose delivered, (range 13% to 32% across countries), and the largest 20% of sites in each country realized costs per dose that were on average 61% lower than those for the smallest 20% of sites, controlling for other factors. Other factors associated with higher costs included hospital status, provision of outreach services, share of effort to management, level of staff training/seniority, distance to vaccine collection, additional days open per week, greater vaccination schedule completion, and per capita gross domestic product. Conclusions: We identified multiple features of sites and their operating environment that were associated with differences in average unit costs, with service volume being the most influential. These findings can inform efforts to improve the efficiency of service delivery and better understand resource needs. © 2017 The Author(s).",The cost determinants of routine infant immunization services: A meta-regression analysis of six country studies,"Menzies N.A., Suharlim C., Geng F., Ward Z.J., Brenzel L., Resch S.C.",2017,BMC Medicine,15,1,178,,,,14.0,10.1186/s12916-017-0942-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030330629&doi=10.1186%2fs12916-017-0942-1&partnerID=40&md5=d9c6ba6a57c546c2d60f8f9e22b20904,"Harvard T.H.

,,"Background Haiti has been experiencing a resurgence of diphtheria since December 2014. Little is known about the factors contributing to the spread and persistence of the disease in the country. Geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis were used to characterize the epidemiology of diphtheria in Haiti between December 2014 and June 2021. Methods Data for the study were collected from official and open-source databases. Choropleth maps were developed to understand spatial trends of diphtheria incidence in Haiti at the commune level, the third administrative division of the country. Spatial autocorrelation was assessed using the global Moran’s I. Local indicators of spatial association (LISA) were employed to detect areas with spatial dependence. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were built to identify factors associated with diphtheria incidence. The performance and fit of the models were compared using the adjusted r-squared (R2) and the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc). Results From December 2014 to June 2021, the average annual incidence of confirmed diphtheria was 0.39 cases per 100,000 (range of annual incidence = 0.04–0.74 per 100,000). During the study period, diphtheria incidence presented weak but significant spatial autocorrelation (I = 0.18, p<0.001). Although diphtheria cases occurred throughout Haiti, nine communes were classified as disease hotspots. In the regression analyses, diphtheria incidence was positively associated with health facility density (number of facilities per 100,000 population) and degree of urbanization (proportion of urban population). Incidence was negatively associated with female literacy. The GWR model considerably improved model performance and fit compared to the OLS model, as indicated by the higher adjusted R2 value (0.28 v 0.15) and lower AICc score (261.97 v 267.13). Conclusion This study demonstrates that GIS and spatial analysis can support the investigation of epidemiological patterns. Furthermore, it shows that diphtheria incidence exhibited spatial variability in Haiti. The disease hotspots and potential risk factors identified in this analysis could provide a basis for future public health interventions aimed at preventing and controlling diphtheria transmission. © 2022 Ikejezie et al.

,,"In this research, we build two food systems datasets in Mexico; The first one describes the structure of agricultural production units and the second one describes food security aspects of the rural population in these agricultural production units. We also build a third dataset, consisting of path diagrams and path coefficients (derived from Structural Equation Modeling) that relate the first dataset to the second dataset in the four most populated ecoregions of Mexico. The description of the path models and the insights they bring to the current state of food security in Mexican rural households are detailed in an associated article entitled ""Is food security primarily associated with smallholder agriculture or with commercial agriculture?: An approach to the case of Mexico using structural equation modeling"" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103091). The agricultural variables (in the first dataset) include farm size, destination of the farmer's production, cultivation practice / water management, predominant source of income of the household, land tenure type, crop diversity, agricultural surface expansion, and the presence of forest cover. They are based on the primary data of the full, latest available agricultural census in Mexico and corresponding official land use / land cover data. The second dataset consists of four food security indicators designed and built for the first food security model in Mexico that incorporates food availability, food accessibility and food utilization aspects. They include the Food Self-sufficiency Index (the balance between food production and food consumption), the Food Access Index (inversely related to marginalization), the Entitlement to Public Health Care index, and the Undernutrition Infrequency index (related to hospital sickness records). We provide the path tables and diagrams that describe the links between the agricultural structure and food security. These diagrams provide the first nationwide statistical evidence for the prominent role of smallholder agriculture in rural food security at the national level and at ecoregion scale for a country of the global South. In order to further investigate the structure of the agricultural production units and their relationships with socioeconomic, territorial and landscape data, artificial intelligence (i.e. data mining and machine learning) techniques could be performed on this compendium of datasets. The food security data may stir the development of more food security models in Mexico in relation to other drivers such as consumption habits and non-agricultural activities of rural households.

,,"Background: The global diet quality score (GDQS) is a simple, standardized metric appropriate for population-based measurement of diet quality globally. Objectives: We aimed to operationalize data collection by modifying the quantity of consumption cutoffs originally developed for the GDQS food groups and to statistically evaluate the performance of the operationalized GDQS relative to the original GDQS against nutrient adequacy and noncommunicable disease (NCD)-related outcomes. Methods: The GDQS application uses a 24-h open-recall to collect a full list of all foods consumed during the previous day or night, and automatically classifies them into corresponding GDQS food group. Respondents use a set of 10 cubes in a range of predetermined sizes to determine if the quantity consumed per GDQS food group was below, or equal to or above food group-specific cutoffs established in grams. Because there is only a total of 10 cubes but as many as 54 cutoffs for the GDQS food groups, the operationalized cutoffs differ slightly from the original GDQS cutoffs. Results: A secondary analysis using 5 cross-sectional datasets comparing the GDQS with the original and operationalized cutoffs showed that the operationalized GDQS remained strongly correlated with nutrient adequacy and was equally sensitive to anthropometric and other clinical measures of NCD risk. In a secondary analysis of a longitudinal cohort study of Mexican teachers, there were no differences between the 2 modalities with the beta coefficients per 1 SD change in the original and operationalized GDQS scores being nearly identical for weight gain (-0.37 and -0.36, respectively, P < 0.001 for linear trend for both models) and of the same clinical order of magnitude for waist circumference (-0.52 and -0.44, respectively, P < 0.001 for linear trend for both models). Conclusion: The operationalized GDQS cutoffs did not change the performance of the GDQS and therefore are recommended for use to collect GDQS data in the future. © The Author(s) 2021.",There's an App for That: Development of an Application to Operationalize the Global Diet Quality Score,"Moursi M., Bromage S., Fung T.T., Isanaka S., Matsuzaki M., Batis C., Castellanos-Gutierrez A., Angulo E., Birk N., Bhupathiraju S.N., He Y., Li Y., Fawzi W., Danielyan A., Thapa S., Ndiyoi L., Vossenaar M., Bellows A., Arsenault J.E., Willett W.C., Deitchler M.",2021,Journal of Nutrition,151,,,176S,184S,8.0,7.0,10.1093/jn/nxab196,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119491347&doi=10.1093%2fjn%2fnxab196&partnerID=40&md5=0032d3b2bba2ba13a5d1e4e659c79b21,"Intake - Center for Dietary Assessment, FHI Solutions, Washington, DC, United States;

The objective of this study is to analyze recent trends in poisoning mortality in the Mexican population. Methods Data regarding mortality induced by poisoning was obtained from a publicly available national database maintained by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. Results During the period from 2000 to 2012, average mortality rates for unintentional and self-poisoning were 1.09 and 0.41 per 100000 population, respectively. The highest mortality rate for unintentional poisoning was in older individuals of both genders while the highest mortality for self-poisoning was in older men and young women. Additional studies are needed in Mexico, especially those that analyze risk factors in older individuals and young women.","Unintentional and self-poisoning mortalities in Mexico, 2000-2012","Gonzalez-Santiago, O., Claudio, P.C.M.S., Cantu-Cardenas, L.G., Favela-Hernandez, J.M.J.",2017,PLOS ONE,12,7,e0181708,,,9.0,2.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0181708,,"[Gonzalez-Santiago, Omar; Morales-San Claudio, Pilar C.; Cantu-Cardenas, Lucia G.; Favela-Hernandez, Juan M.

,,"Objective: Novel, inexpensive solutions are needed for improved management of vector-borne and other diseases in resource-poor environments. Emerging free software providing access to satellite imagery and simple editing tools (e.g. Google Earth™) complement existing geographic information system (GIS) software and provide new opportunities for: (i) strengthening overall public health capacity through development of information for city infrastructures; and (ii) display of public health data directly on an image of the physical environment. Methods: We used freely accessible satellite imagery and a set of feature-making tools included in the software (allowing for production of polygons, lines and points) to generate information for city infrastructure and to display disease data in a dengue decision support system (DDSS) framework. Findings: Two cities in Mexico (Chetumal and Merida) were used to demonstrate that a basic representation of city infrastructure useful as a spatial backbone in a DDSS can be rapidly developed at minimal cost. Data layers generated included labelled polygons representing city blocks, lines representing streets, and points showing the locations of schools and health clinics. City blocks were colour-coded to show presence of dengue cases. The data layers were successfully imported in a format known as shapefile into a GIS software. Conclusion: The combination of Google Earth™ and free GIS software (e.g. HealthMapper, developed by WHO, and SIGEpi, developed by PAHO) has tremendous potential to strengthen overall public health capacity and facilitate decision support system approaches to prevention and control of vector-borne diseases in resource-poor environments.",Use of Google Earth™ to strengthen public health capacity and facilitate management of vector-borne diseases in resource-poor environments,"Lozano-Fuentes S., Elizondo-Quiroga D., Farfan-Ale J.A., Lorono-Pino M.A., Garcia-Rejon J., Gomez-Carro S., Lira-Zumbardo V., Najera-Vazquez R., Fernandez-Salas I., Calderon-Martinez J., Dominguez-Galera M., Mis-Avila P., Morris N., Coleman M., Moore C.G., Beatya B.J., Eisen L.",2008,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,86,9,,718,725,7.0,63.0,10.2471/BLT.07.045880,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-50849104581&doi=10.2471%2fBLT.07.045880&partnerID=40&md5=9ab737e12c45e3cdb03fe77a77985916,"Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States; Laboratorio de Arbovirologia, Universidad Autónoma de Yucatan, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; Servicios de Salud de Yucatan, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; Laboratorio de Entomología Medica, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; Servicios Estatales de Salud de Quintana Roo, Chetumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico; Malaria Research Programme, Medical Research Council, Durban, South Africa; Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, United Kingdom","Lozano-Fuentes S., Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States; Elizondo-Quiroga D., Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States; Farfan-Ale J.A., Laboratorio de Arbovirologia, Universidad Autónoma de Yucatan, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; Loroño-Pino M.A., Laboratorio de Arbovirologia, Universidad Autónoma de Yucatan, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; Garcia-Rejon J., Laboratorio de Arbovirologia, Universidad Autónoma de Yucatan, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; Gomez-Carro S., Servicios de Salud de Yucatan, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; Lira-Zumbardo V., Servicios de Salud de Yucatan, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; Najera-Vazquez R., Servicios de Salud de Yucatan, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; Fernandez-Salas I., Laboratorio de Entomología Medica, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; Calderon-Martinez J., Servicios Estatales de Salud de Quintana Roo, Chetumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico; Dominguez-Galera M., Servicios Estatales de Salud de Quintana Roo, Chetumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico; Mis-Avila P., Servicios Estatales de Salud de Quintana Roo, Chetumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico; Morris N., Malaria Research Programme, Medical Research Council, Durban, South Africa; Coleman M., Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, United Kingdom; Moore C.G., Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States; Beatya B.J., Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States; Eisen L., Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States",,"Animals; Arthropod Vectors; Databases, Factual; Disease Outbreaks; Endemic Diseases; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Internet; Mexico; Parasitic Diseases; Population Surveillance; Public Health; Chetumal Bay; Merida [Yucatan]; Mexico [North America]; North America; Quintana Roo; Yucatan; decision support system; dengue fever; GIS; health care; satellite imagery; software; article; computer program; cost benefit analysis; decision support system; dengue; disease carrier; disease control; environmental monitoring; geographic information system; health center; human; medical informatics; medical information; Mexico; public health service; telecommunication; animal; endemic disease; epidemic; factual database; health survey; Internet; methodology; Mexico; parasite vector; parasitosis; public health","Animals;Arthropod Vectors;Databases, Factual;Disease Outbreaks;Endemic Diseases;Geographic Information Systems;Humans;Internet;Mexico;Parasitic Diseases;Population Surveillance;Public Health;Chetumal Bay;Merida [Yucatan];Mexico [North America];North America;Quintana Roo;Yucatan;decision support system;dengue fever;GIS;health care;satellite imagery;software;article;computer program;cost benefit analysis;dengue;disease carrier;disease control;environmental monitoring;geographic information system;health center;human;medical informatics;medical information;public health service;telecommunication;animal;endemic disease;epidemic;factual database;health survey;methodology;parasite vector;parasitosis","L.

The Observatory, created in 2008, is a joint effort of the Juarez Municipal Government, Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez (Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez), and the Pan American Health Organization. The Observatory's main objective is to propose strategies and public policy recommendations to prevent and control violence and injuries in the Juarez Municipality. Most key federal, state, and local agencies have joined this independent autonomous citizen-based initiative, feed the databases, and benefit from the information produced by a multisectoral, multidisciplinary approach. The Observatory contributes far more than the technical data provided and its facilitating functions. The clear results obtained in such a short time-as seen in the preliminary results of the case study on road injuries from January 2009 to July 2011- demonstrate the appropriateness of this course of action and should stimulate the creation of new observatories whenever and wherever needed. Lessons learned, as discussed here, can open the way to new endeavors, and current challenges show how much work remains to be done.","Using evidence on violence and injury prevention for policy development and decision making in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico","Gutierrez L.A., Pacheco S., Juarez A.Y., Palacios L.A., Cerqueira M.T.",2012,Revista Panamericana de Salud Publica/Pan American Journal of Public Health,31,5,,365,372,7.0,3.0,10.1590/S1020-49892012000500003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864217110&doi=10.1590%2fS1020-49892012000500003&partnerID=40&md5=442dbdaad3e716d4ae8e34ee80d329ea,"United States-Mexico Border Office, Pan American Health Organization, El Paso, TX, United States; Observatorio de Seguridad y Convivencia Ciudadanas, Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez, Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico; Instituto Municipal de Investigación y Planeación, Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico","Gutiérrez L.A., United States-Mexico Border Office, Pan American Health Organization, El Paso, TX, United States; Pacheco S., Observatorio de Seguridad y Convivencia Ciudadanas, Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez, Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico; Juárez A.Y., Observatorio de Seguridad y Convivencia Ciudadanas, Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez, Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico; Palacios L.A., Instituto Municipal de Investigación y Planeación, Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico; Cerqueira M.T., United States-Mexico Border Office, Pan American Health Organization, El Paso, TX, United States",Accidents; Border health; Epidemiologic surveillance; Geographic information systems; Mexico; Traffic; United States; Violence,Decision Making; Geographic Information Systems; Health Policy; Humans; International Cooperation; Mexico; Population Surveillance; Public Health; United States; Violence; Wounds and Injuries; Chihuahua; Juarez; Mexico [North America]; accident; border region; data set; decision making; epidemiology; GIS; health survey; injury; observatory; policy development; policy implementation; social policy; traffic congestion; violence; article; decision making; geographic information system; health care policy; health survey; human; injury; international cooperation; methodology; Mexico; public health; statistics; United States; violence,Accidents;Border health;Epidemiologic surveillance;Geographic information systems;Mexico;Traffic;United States;Violence;Decision Making;Health Policy;Humans;International Cooperation;Population Surveillance;Public Health;Wounds and Injuries;Chihuahua;Juarez;Mexico [North America];accident;border region;data set;epidemiology;GIS;health survey;injury;observatory;policy development;policy implementation;social policy;traffic congestion;article;geographic information system;health care policy;human;methodology;statistics,"S.

Our method formalizes the common practice in the literature and consists of three steps: identification of relevant food categories, pairing of food contents food groups in HEIS data, and calculation of the typical amount of nutrients by food group. We illustrate the usage of the method with Mexican data and provide a publicly available data set to readily convert food purchases into six nutrients: calories, proteins, vitamins A and C, iron, and zinc. We perform a descriptive analysis of the evolution of nutrients intake among Mexican households between 2008 and 2020, considering differences by income level. Our results reflect the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on nutrient availability in Mexican households, mainly driven by a substantial reduction in the expenditure in food consumed away from home, although for most nutrients the trend was stable over most of the period. © 2022 by the authors.",Using Household Expenditure Surveys for Comparable and Replicable Nutritional Analysis: Evidence from México,"Hernandez-Solano A., Perez-Hernandez V., Burrola-Mendez S., Aguirre A., Gallegos J., Teruel G.",2022,Nutrients,14,17,3588,,,,0.0,10.3390/nu14173588,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137556696&doi=10.3390%2fnu14173588&partnerID=40&md5=6bf356ebe1803f23e80305dc1ce9e3fa,"Instituto de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo con Equidad (EQUIDE), Universidad Iberoamericana, Prolongación Paseo de Reforma 880 Lomas de Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Ciudad de México, 01219, Mexico; Departamento de Salud, Universidad Iberoamericana, Prolongación Paseo de Reforma 880 Lomas de Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Ciudad de México, 01219, Mexico; Independent Researcher, Estado de México, Tlalnepantla, 54060, Mexico; Independent Researcher, Estado de México, Cuautitlán Izcalli, 54740, Mexico","Hernández-Solano A., Instituto de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo con Equidad (EQUIDE), Universidad Iberoamericana, Prolongación Paseo de Reforma 880 Lomas de Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Ciudad de México, 01219, Mexico; Pérez-Hernández V., Instituto de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo con Equidad (EQUIDE), Universidad Iberoamericana, Prolongación Paseo de Reforma 880 Lomas de Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Ciudad de México, 01219, Mexico; Burrola-Méndez S., Departamento de Salud, Universidad Iberoamericana, Prolongación Paseo de Reforma 880 Lomas de Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Ciudad de México, 01219, Mexico; Aguirre A., Independent Researcher, Estado de México, Tlalnepantla, 54060, Mexico; Gallegos J., Independent Researcher, Estado de México, Cuautitlán Izcalli, 54740, Mexico; Teruel G., Instituto de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo con Equidad (EQUIDE), Universidad Iberoamericana, Prolongación Paseo de Reforma 880 Lomas de Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Ciudad de México, 01219, Mexico",calories; food away from home; household income expenditure surveys; iron; Mexico; micronutrients; proteins; vitamins; zinc,COVID-19; Health Expenditures; Humans; Mexico; Pandemics; Vitamins; ascorbic acid; iron; protein; retinol; zinc; vitamin; Article; calorie; coronavirus disease 2019; descriptive research; financial management; food intake; household expenditure; household income; human; Mexico; nutrient availability; nutrient intake; nutritional assessment; nutritional value; pandemic; epidemiology; health care cost,calories;food away from home;household income expenditure surveys;iron;Mexico;micronutrients;proteins;vitamins;zinc;COVID-19;Health Expenditures;Humans;Pandemics;ascorbic acid;protein;retinol;vitamin;Article;calorie;coronavirus disease 2019;descriptive research;financial management;food intake;household expenditure;household income;human;nutrient availability;nutrient intake;nutritional assessment;nutritional value;pandemic;epidemiology;health care cost,"V.

,,"STUDY QUESTION How do women's first morning urinary cortisol levels, a marker of stress axis activity, vary during the peri-conceptional period (the 12 weeks around conception)? SUMMARY ANSWER First morning urinary cortisol follows an overall increasing trajectory across the peri-conceptional period, interrupted by 2 week-long decreases during the week preceding conception and the fifth week following conception. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Later gestational stages (i.e. second and third trimesters) are characterized by increasing levels of circulating cortisol. This increase is hypothesized to constitute a response to the energy demands imposed by fetal growth, and the development of energy reserves in preparation for nursing and performing regular activities while carrying pregnancy's extra weight and volume. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This study is based on a data set collected as part of a longitudinal, naturalistic investigation into the interactions between the stress (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA)) and reproductive (hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA)) axes. Biomarkers of HPAA and HPGA function were quantified in first morning urinary specimens collected every other day from 22 healthy women who conceived a pregnancy during the study. We analyzed the longitudinal within- and between-individual variation in first morning urinary cortisol levels across the 12-week peri-conceptional period. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Participants were recruited from two rural, aboriginal, neighboring communities in Guatemala. Cortisol, estradiol and progesterone metabolites (estrone-3-glucuronide and pregnanediol glucuronide, respectively) and hCG levels were quantified in first morning urinary specimens using immunoassays to determine time of conception and confirm pregnancy maintenance. Linear mixed-effects models with regression splines were used to evaluate the magnitude and significance of changes in cortisol trajectories. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Overall, maternal first morning urinary cortisol increased from 6 weeks prior to conception (geometric mean ± SD = 58.14 ± 36.00 ng/ml) to 6 weeks post-conception (89.29 ± 46.76 ng/ml). The magnitude of the increase between the pre- and post-conception periods varied significantly between women (likelihood ratio test statistic = 8.0017, P = 0.005). The peri-conceptional period is characterized by an increasing cortisol trajectory (+1.36% per day; P = 0.007) interrupted by a week-long decline immediately prior to conception (-4.02% per day; P = 0.0013). After conception cortisol increased again (+1.73% per day; P = 0.0008) for 4 weeks, fell in the fifth week (-6.60% per day; P = 0.0002) and increased again in post-conceptional week 6 (+8.86% per day; P = 0.002). Maternal urinary cortisol levels varied with sex of the gestating embryo. During gestational week 2, mothers carrying female embryos (N = 10) had higher mean cortisol levels than those carrying male embryos (N = 9) (t(17) = 2.28, P = 0.04). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Our results are based on a relatively small sample (n = 22) of women. However, our repeated-measures design with an average of 27 ± 8 (mean ± SD) data points per woman strengthens the precision of estimates resulting in high statistical power. Additionally, our study population's high degree of ethnic and cultural homogeneity reduces the effects of confounders compared with those found in industrialized populations. This higher level of homogeneity also increases our statistical power. However, since there may be small differences in absolute cortisol values among ethnic groups, the social and biological background of our sample may affect the generalizability of our results. General patterns of HPAA activity, however, are expected to be universal across women. Finally, as there is, to the best of our knowledge, no evidence to the contrary, we assumed that urinary cortisol levels reflect HPAA activity and that changes in gonadal steroids across the menstrual cycle do not affect the levels of free cortisol measured in urine. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal profile of basal maternal HPAA activity across the peri-conceptional period. A basic understanding of the normative (basal as opposed to stress-induced) changes in HPAA activity across this period is needed to accurately assess women's stress at this juncture. Importantly, changes in HPAA activity are likely to play a critical role in ovulation, fertilization, implantation, placentation and embryonic programing. Thus, this novel information should aid in the development of interventions aimed at preventing or moderating undesired effects of maternal physiological stress during the peri-conceptional period on reproductive outcomes as well as embryonic development.

,,"Background: Simulation-based training has become an accepted clinical training andragogy in high-resource settings with its use increasing in low-resource settings. Video recordings of simulated scenarios are commonly used by facilitators. Beyond using the videos during debrief sessions, researchers can also analyze the simulation videos to quantify technical and nontechnical skills during simulated scenarios over time. Little is known about the feasibility and use of large-scale systems to video record and analyze simulation and debriefing data for monitoring and evaluation in low-resource settings. Methods: This manuscript describes the process of designing and implementing a large-scale video monitoring system. Mentees and Mentors were consented and all simulations and debriefs conducted at 320 Primary Health Centers (PHCs) were video recorded. The system design, number of video recordings, and inter-rater reliability of the coded videos were assessed. Results: The final dataset included a total of 11,278 videos. Overall, a total of 2,124 simulation videos were coded and 183 (12%) were blindly double-coded. For the double-coded sample, the average inter-rater reliability (IRR) scores were 80% for nontechnical skills, and 94% for clinical technical skills. Among 4,450 long debrief videos received, 216 were selected for coding and all were double-coded. Data quality of simulation videos was found to be very good in terms of recorded instances of ''unable to see'' and ''unable to hear'' in Phases 1 and 2. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that video monitoring systems can be effectively implemented at scale in resource limited settings. Further, video monitoring systems can play several vital roles within program implementation, including monitoring and evaluation, provision of actionable feedback to program implementers, and assurance of program fidelity.
