11;"Background Mammographic screening has been used to reduce breast cancer mortality worldwide and remains the main modality for the early detection of this disease. Women from low and middle-income countries still lack access to periodic mammograms and efficient health care. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore opportunistic mammographic coverage in Brazil, while considering the privately insured population and its association with early breast cancer (EBC) detection. Methods Data on population, gross domestic product (GDP), number of mammograms performed under the Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) public health system or private system, and women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer from 2010 to 2019 were retrieved from publicly available databases. Results A total of 39 555 636 mammograms with an average of 3 955 564 ± 395 704 mammograms were obtained per year from 2010 to 2019 in Brazil. Most examinations (58.6%) were performed in the target population (50-69 years old), while 32% were performed in women aged 40-49, and 9.4% were performed in women <40 years or >70 years of age. The 10-year mammogram coverage was 30.6% in the target population and 24.8% in the population aged 40-49 years, with significant variation across states and municipalities. The overall EBC detection rates in Brazil were 30.6% in populations aged 50-70 and 24.8% in those aged 40-50 years. We observed a positive correlation between coverage and EBC detection rate (r = 0.68; P = 0.0001 (50-70 years) and r = 0.75; P < 0.0001 (40-50 years)). According to the GDP, the municipalities with higher GDP per capita had higher mammogram coverage (P < 0.0001). Conclusions The coverage of mammographic screening for women under the SUS is far below the international guidelines. Additionally, a significant number of mammograms have been performed in non-target populations. This scenario reflects the problematic screening programs in developing countries and reflects low rates of EBC diagnosis. As Brazil is a continental country with heterogeneous socioeconomic indicators, we observed significant variations in the number of mammograms performed by age groups when separated by states and municipalities. Even when considering supplemental health system coverage, municipalities with higher GDP per capita were associated with higher mammogram coverage. © 2022 The Author(s) JoGH 2022 ISoGH";10-year opportunistic mammographic screening scenario in Brazil and its impact on breast cancer early detection: a nationwide population-based study;Cuoghi I.C., da Silva Soares M.F., dos Santos G.M.C., Candido-dos-Reis F.J., Poli-Neto O.B., de Andrade J.M., Bosquesi P.L., Orlandini L.F., Tiezzi D.G.;2022;Journal of Global Health;1;10.7189/jogh.12.04061;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139880822&doi=10.7189%2fjogh.12.04061&partnerID=40&md5=55ff568f30ae92b999879fab516f6416;"CEPAM – Centro de Pesquisa Avançada em Medicina da UNILAGO, Faculdade de Medicina UNILAGO, União das Faculdades dos Grandes Lagos, São Paulo, São José do Rio Preto, Brazil; Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto FMRP – USP, São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil; Laboratory for Translational Data Science - University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas UNESP, São Paulo, Araraquara, Brazil";;"adult; aged; Brazil; breast tumor; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; early cancer diagnosis; female; human; mammography; middle aged; Adult; Aged; Brazil; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Mammography; Middle Aged";"adult;aged;Brazil;breast tumor;cross-sectional study;diagnostic imaging;early cancer diagnosis;female;human;mammography;middle aged;Breast Neoplasms;Cross-Sectional Studies;Early Detection of Cancer;Humans";Brazil;"- Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE.

14;"Background: The number of transplants performed relies, partially, on recipients' variables on the waiting list. The goal of this study was to compare recipients from a high-volume liver center in Argentina with the rest of the country. Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of liver transplant recipients nationally between January 2013 and April 2017. It involved extracting data from the open database CRESI-SINTRA (the Argentinian database of the National Procurement Organization, an equivalent to the United Network for Organ Sharing); expressing results by percentages, medians, and interquartile ranges (IQRs); and comparing the national population with the population transplanted at Hospital El Cruce (HEC). The Mann-Whitney U test was used for analysis. Results: Nationally, 1434 liver transplants were performed. A total of 177 (12.34%) were emergency status; 811 (56.6%) were by the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) (n = 759)/PELD (Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease) (n = 52), with a median graft assignment position of 5 (IQR, 3–10) in 57.2 days (IQR, 11–217). Median MELD access was 29 points (IQR, 24–33). A total of 446 (31.1%) had MELD exceptions; 249 (55.8%) of these were due to Milan hepatocellular carcinoma. At the HEC, 167 liver transplantations were performed; 26 (15.6%) were emergency status and 97 (58.1%) by MELD (none PELD). Their median graft assignment position was 4 (IQR, 4–16) in 19.1 days (IQR, 4–90); median MELD access was 28 points (IQR, 24–31). Forty-five patients (26.9%) had MELD exceptions; 31 (68.9%) were due to hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusions: Our center has a larger proportion of recipients transplanted by emergency status and MELD, similar MELD access, and less waiting list time, reflecting our wide policy of liver graft acceptance. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.";Access to Grafts in a Liver Transplant Center: Does It Rely on the Severity of the Waiting List Population?;Daciuk N.I., Quinonez E.G., Poupard M., Vergara Sandoval R.M., Mattera F.J.;2018;Transplantation Proceedings;0;10.1016/j.transproceed.2017.12.049;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044141657&doi=10.1016%2fj.transproceed.2017.12.049&partnerID=40&md5=ad43530764085e0a4c696e6970fec61a;Liver Transplant Unit, Hospital El Cruce, Florencio Varela, Argentina;;"adult; Argentina; Article; child; comparative study; controlled study; digestive system disease assessment; emergency care; groups by age; health care access; health care facility; hospital admission; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver graft; liver transplant center; liver transplantation; major clinical study; Model For End Stage Liver Disease Score; Pediatric End Stage Liver Disease; priority journal; retrospective study; end stage liver disease; female; hospital admission; liver transplantation; male; middle aged; severity of illness index; statistics and numerical data; Argentina; End Stage Liver Disease; Female; Humans; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Waiting Lists";"adult;Argentina;Article;child;comparative study;controlled study;digestive system disease assessment;emergency care;groups by age;health care access;health care facility;hospital admission;human;liver cell carcinoma;liver graft;liver transplant center;liver transplantation;major clinical study;Model For End Stage Liver Disease Score;Pediatric End Stage Liver Disease;priority journal;retrospective study;end stage liver disease;female;male;middle aged;severity of illness index;statistics and numerical data;Humans;Retrospective Studies;Waiting Lists";Argentina;Liver transplant recipient: open database CRESI-SINTRA (the Argentinian database of the National Procurement Organization).

16;"Different countries have adopted various control measures for the COVID-19 pandemic in different periods, and as the virus continues to mutate, the progression of the pandemic and preventive measures adopted have varied dynamically over time. Thus, quantitative analysis of the dynamic impact of different factors such as vaccination, mutant virus, social isolation, etc., on transmission and predicting pandemic progress has become a difficult task. To overcome the challenges above and enable governments to formulate reasonable countermeasures against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we integrate several mathematical methods and propose a new adaptive multifactorial and geographically diverse epidemiological model based on a modified version of the classical susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model. Based on public datasets, a multi-center study was carried out considering 21 regions. First, a retrospective study was conducted to predict the number of infections over the next 30 days in 13 representative pandemic areas worldwide with an accuracy of 87.53%, confirming the robustness of the proposed model. Second, the impact of three scenarios on COVID-19 was quantified based on the scalability of the model: two different vaccination regimens were analyzed, and it was found that the number of infections would progressively decrease over time after vaccination; variant virus caused a 301.55% increase in infections in the United Kingdom; and 3-tier social lockdown in the United Kingdom reduced the infections by 47.01%. Third, we made short-term prospective predictions for the next 15 and 30 days for six countries with severe COVID-19 transmission and the predicted trend is accurate.

18;The current spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had put all the scientific community in alert. Even in the presence of different vaccines, the active virus still represents a global challenge. Due to its rapid spreading and uncertain nature, having the ability to forecast its dynamics becomes a necessary tool in the development of fast and efficient health policies. This study implements a temporal convolutional neural network (TCN), trained with the open covid-19 data set sourced by the Health Ministry of Peru (MINSA) on the Peruvian coast. In order to obtain a robust model, the data was divided into validation and training sets, without overlapping. Using the validation set the model architecture and hyper-parameters were found with Bayesian optimization. Using the optimal configuration the TCN was trained with a test and forecasting window of 15 days ahead. Predictions on available data were made from March 06, 2020 until April 13, 2021, whereas forecasting from April 14 to April 29, 2021. In order to account for uncertainty, the TCN estimated the 5%, 50% and 95% prediction quantiles. Evaluation was made using the MAE, MAD, MSLE, RMSLE and PICP metrics. Results suggested some variations in the data distribution. Test results shown an improvement of 24.241, 0.704 and 0.422 for the MAD, MSLE and RMSLE metrics respectively.

20;Here we present a discrete-time-evolution model with one day interval to forecast the propagation of Covid-19. The proposed model can be easily implemented with daily updated data sets of the pandemic publicly available by distinct online sources. It has only two adjustable parameters and it predicts the evolution of the total number of infected people in a country for the next 14 days if parameters do not change during the analyzed period. The model incorporates the main aspects of the disease such as the fact that there are asymptomatic and symptomatic phases (both capable of propagating the virus), and that these phases take almost two weeks before the infected person status evolves to the next (asymptomatic becomes symptomatic or symptomatic becomes either recovered or dead). A striking advantage of the model for its implementation by the health sector is that it gives directly the number of total infected people in each day (in thousands, tens of thousands or hundred of thousands). Here, the model is tested with data from Brazil, UK and South Korea, presenting low error rates on the prediction of the evolution of the disease in all analyzed countries. We hope this model may be a useful tool to estimate the propagation of the disease. © 2020 Curado, Curado.

21;Introduction Biological drugs open new possibilities to treat diseases for which drug therapy is limited, but they may be associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Objective To identify the ADRs associated with the use of biological drugs in Colombia. Methods This was a retrospective study of ADR reports from 2014 to 2019, contained in the database of Audifarma SA pharmacovigilance program. The ADRs, groups of associated drugs, and affected organs were classified. Results In total, 5,415 reports of ADRs associated with biological drugs were identified in 78 Colombian cities. A total of 76.1% of the cases corresponded to women. The majority were classified as type A (55.0%) and B (28.9%), and 16.7% were serious cases. The respiratory tract was the most affected organ system (16.8%), followed by the skin and appendages (15.6%). Antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drugs accounted for 70.6% of the reports, and the drugs related to the greatest number of ADRs were adalimumab (12.2%) and etanercept (11.6%). Conclusions The reporting of ADRs has increased in recent years and these reactions are mostly classified as tyoe A or B, categorized as serious in almost one-fifth of the reported cases and associated mainly with immunomodulators and antineoplastic agents. This type of study can support decision makers in ways that benefit patient safety and interaction with health systems.;Adverse drug reactions associated with the use of biological agents;Machado-Alba, J.E., Jimenez-Morales, A.L., Moran-Yela, Y.C., Parrado-Fajardo, I.Y., Valladales-Restrepo, L.F.;2020;PLOS ONE;2;10.1371/journal.pone.0240276;;"[Enrique Machado-Alba, Jorge; Fernando Valladales-Restrepo, Luis] Univ Tecnol Pereira Audifarma SA, Grp Invest Farmacoepidemiol & Farmacovigilancia, Pereira, Risaralda, Colombia; [Enrique Machado-Alba, Jorge; Liliana Jimenez-Morales, Anyi; Carolina Moran-Yela, Yulieth] Univ Tecnol Pereira Audifarma SA, Pereira, Risaralda, Colombia; [Yadira Parrado-Fajardo, Ilsa] Univ Tecnol Pereira Audifarma SA, Grp Invest Farmacoepidemiol & Farmacovigilancia, Bogota, Colombia; [Fernando Valladales-Restrepo, Luis] Fundac Univ Autonoma Amer, Fac Med, Grp Invest Biomed, Pereira, Colombia";;"MODIFYING ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUGS; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; EVENTS; SAFETY; SURVEILLANCE";"MODIFYING ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUGS;RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS;EVENTS;SAFETY;SURVEILLANCE";Colombia;adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reports: Audifarma SA pharmacovigilance (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bkcfkstn );Tabular;Open;No;Colombia;yes
31;"Background Cancer is a leading cause of disease and death in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Contemporary data on the cancer burden aims to inform effective cancer policies; this article provides an update and benchmarking of national cancer incidence and mortality estimates for the year 2020, alongside recent mortality trends in the region. Methods The number of new cancer cases and deaths were extracted from the GLOBOCAN 2020 database developed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and mortality data over time from IARC's cancer mortality database, New cancer cases, deaths and corresponding age-standardized rates per 100,000 person-years are presented. Random fluctuations in mortality trends by country, sex and cancer site were smoothed using LOWE-SS regression. Findings An estimated total of 1.5 million new cancer cases and 700,000 deaths occur annually in LAC, with corresponding incidence and mortality rates of 186.5 and 86.6 per 100,000. The most common cancers in 2020 were prostate (15%), breast (14%), colorectal (9%), lung (7%) and stomach (5%). Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death (12%), though rates varied substantially between countries. The mortality trends of infectious-related cancers tended to decline in most countries, while rates of cancer types linked to westernization were mainly increasing. Assuming rates remain unchanged, the cancer burden in LAC will increase by 67% reaching 2.4 million new cases annually by 2040. Interpretation The cancer patterns reflect important underlying sociodemographic changes occurring over the last decades. With an increasing burden anticipated over the next decades in this region, there is a need to plan oncological service provision accordingly. Copyright (c) 2022 World Health Organization.

35;Objectives: Extending healthy life expectancy (HALE), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in “full health” by taking into account years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury, is a common topic worldwide. This study aims to clarify the relationships between the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and life expectancy (LE) and HALE globally using publicly available international data. Setting: Analyses were conducted on 130 countries with populations of 1 million or more for which all data were available. Individual countries were scored from 0 to 9 to indicate adherence to the Mediterranean diet according to the MDS scoring method. The supply of vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereals, fish, and olive oil per 1,000 kcal per country was calculated based on the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database, with a score of 1 for above the median and 0 for below. The same method was used to calculate scores of presumed detrimental components (meat and dairy), with consumption below the median given a value of 1, and consumption above the median given a value of 0. For ethanol, a score of 1 was given for 10g to 50 g of consumption. We investigated the cross-sectional associations between the MDS and LE and HALE at birth in 2009, and the longitudinal associations between the MDS in 2009 and LE and HALE between 2009 and 2019, controlling for covariates at baseline using linear mixed models. Results: In the cross-sectional analysis, the MDS was significantly positively associated with LE (β=0.906 [95% confidence interval, 0.065–1.747], p=0.037) and HALE (β=0.875 [0.207–1.544], p=0.011) after controlling for all covariates. The longitudinal analysis also revealed significantly positive associations between the MDS and LE (0.621 [0.063–1.178], p=0.030) and HALE (0.694 [0.227–1.161], p=0.004) after controlling for all covariates. Conclusion: The present study, based on an analysis using 10 years of international data, showed that countries with a higher MDS showed a positive association with HALE. © 2022, Serdi and Springer-Verlag International SAS, part of Springer Nature.;Association between the Mediterranean Diet Score and Healthy Life Expectancy: A Global Comparative Study;Sezaki A., Imai T., Miyamoto K., Kawase F., Shirai Y., Abe C., Sanada M., Inden A., Rato T., Sugihara N., Shimokata H.;2022;Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging;5;10.1007/s12603-022-1811-y;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131541085&doi=10.1007%2fs12603-022-1811-y&partnerID=40&md5=a08e5f04c350f9ea0b0c130a16f41e06;"Graduate School of Nutritional Science, Nagoya University of Arts and Sciences, Nagoya Gakugei Daigaku, Aichi, Japan; Department of Food Sciences and Human Nutrition, Ryukoku University, Shiga, Japan; Department of Food Science and Nutrition, Doshisha Women’s College of Liberal Arts, Kyoto, Japan; Institute of Health and Nutrition, Nagoya University of Arts and Sciences, Aichi, Japan; Department of Nursing, Nagoya University of Arts and Sciences, Aichi, Japan; Department of Nutrition, Asuke Hospital Aichi Prefectural Welfare Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives, Aichi, Japan; Department of Food and Nutritional Environment, Kinjo Gakuin University, Aichi, Japan; Department of Food and Nutrition, Tsu City College, Mie, Japan; Department of Nursing, Heisei College of Health Sciences, Gifu, Japan; Clinical Nutrition Unit, Clinical Nutrition Unit, Hamamatsu University Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan; Nutrition Division, Japanese Red Cross Aichi Medical Center Nagoya Daini Hospital, Aichi, Japan; Faculty of Core Research, Ochanomizu University, Tokyo, Japan";"global study; healthy life expectancy; longitudinal analysis; Mediterranean Diet Score";"olive oil; aging; alcohol consumption; Argentina; Article; cereal; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; data base; energy resource; female; fish; fruit; Greece; healthy life expectancy; human; Italy; Japan; legume; male; Mediterranean diet; Mongolia; Morocco; nut; obesity; physical activity; scoring system; smoking; Southern Europe; Sweden; Switzerland; vegetable; animal; life expectancy; statistical model; Animals; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet, Mediterranean; Healthy Life Expectancy; Humans; Life Expectancy; Linear Models";"global study;healthy life expectancy;longitudinal analysis;Mediterranean Diet Score;olive oil;aging;alcohol consumption;Argentina;Article;cereal;comparative study;controlled study;cross-sectional study;data base;energy resource;female;fish;fruit;Greece;human;Italy;Japan;legume;male;Mediterranean diet;Mongolia;Morocco;nut;obesity;physical activity;scoring system;smoking;Southern Europe;Sweden;Switzerland;vegetable;animal;life expectancy;statistical model;Animals;Cross-Sectional Studies;Diet, Mediterranean;Humans;Linear Models";103 Countries;"- LE (life expectancy): World Bank Open Data. https://data.worldbank.org/

37;"Background: The effect of socioeconomic stressors on the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently open to debate. Using time-series analysis, our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between unemployment rate and hospital admission for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke in Brazil over a recent 11-year span. Methods and results: Data on monthly hospital admissions for AMI and stroke from March 2002 to December 2013 were extracted from the Brazilian Public Health System Database. The monthly unemployment rate was obtained from the Brazilian Institute for Applied Economic Research, during the same period. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to test the association of temporal series. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. From March 2002 to December 2013, 778,263 admissions for AMI and 1,581,675 for stroke were recorded. During this time period, the unemployment rate decreased from 12.9% in 2002 to 4.3% in 2013, while admissions due to AMI and stroke increased. However, the adjusted ARIMA model showed a positive association between the unemployment rate and admissions for AMI but not for stroke (estimate coefficient = 2.81 +/- 0.93; p = 0.003 and estimate coefficient = 2.40 +/- 4.34; p = 0.58, respectively). Conclusions: From 2002 to 2013, hospital admissions for AMI and stroke increased, whereas the unemployment rate decreased. However, the adjusted ARIMA model showed a positive association between unemployment rate and admissions due to AMI but not for stroke. Further studies are warranted to validate our findings and to better explore the mechanisms by which socioeconomic stressors, such as unemployment, might impact on the incidence of CVD.

43;Introduction BCG vaccination modulates immune responses to unrelated pathogens. This off-target effect could reduce the impact of emerging pathogens. As a readily available, inexpensive intervention that has a well-established safety profile, BCG is a good candidate for protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) and other vulnerable groups against COVID-19. Methods and analysis This international multicentre phase III randomised controlled trial aims to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the incidence of symptomatic and severe COVID-19 at 6 months (co-primary outcomes) compared with no BCG vaccination. We plan to randomise 10 078 HCWs from Australia, The Netherlands, Spain, the UK and Brazil in a 1:1 ratio to BCG vaccination or no BCG (control group). The participants will be followed for 1 year with questionnaires and collection of blood samples. For any episode of illness, clinical details will be collected daily, and the participant will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The secondary objectives are to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the rate, incidence, and severity of any febrile or respiratory illness (including SARS-CoV-2), as well as work absenteeism. The safety of BCG vaccination in HCWs will also be evaluated. Immunological analyses will assess changes in the immune system following vaccination, and identify factors associated with susceptibility to or protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other infections. Ethics and dissemination Ethical and governance approval will be obtained from participating sites. Results will be published in peer-reviewed open-access journals. The final cleaned and locked database will be deposited in a data sharing repository archiving system.;BCG vaccination to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in healthcare workers: Protocol for a randomised controlled trial (BRACE trial);Pittet, L.F., Messina, N.L., Gardiner, K., Orsini, F., Abruzzo, V., Bannister, S., Bonten, M., Campbell, J.L., Croda, J., Dalcolmo, M., Elia, S., Germano, S., Goodall, C., Gwee, A., Jamieson, T., Jardim, B., Kollmann, T.R., Lacerda, M.V.G., Lee, K.J., Legge, D., Lucas, M., Lynn, D.J., McDonald, E., Manning, L., Munns, C.F., Perrett, K.P., Aymerich, C.P., Richmond, P., Shann, F., Sudbury, E., Villanueva, P., Wood, N.J., Lieschke, K., Subbarao, K., Davidson, A., Curtis, N.;2021;BMJ OPEN;13;10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052101;;"[Pittet, Laure F.;

45;Background All-cause perioperative mortality rate (POMR) is a commonly reported metric to assess surgical quality. Benchmarking POMR remains difficult due to differences in surgical volume and case mix combined with the burden of reporting and leveraging this complex and high-volume data. We seek to determine whether the pooled and individual procedure POMR of each bellwether (cesarean section, laparotomy, management of open fracture) correlate with state-level all-cause POMR in the interest of identifying benchmark procedures that can be used to make standardized regional comparisons of surgical quality. Methods The Brazilian National Healthcare Database (DATASUS) was queried to identify unadjusted all-cause POMR for all patient admissions among public hospitals in Brazil in 2018. Bellwether procedures were identified as any procedure involving laparotomy, cesarean section, or treatment of open long bone fracture and then classified as emergent or elective. The pooled POMR of all bellwether procedures as well as for each individual bellwether procedure was compared with the all-cause POMR in each of the 26 states, and one federal district and correlations were calculated. Funnel plots were used to compare surgical volume to perioperative mortality for each bellwether procedure. Results 4,756,642 surgical procedures were reported to DATASUS in 2018: 237,727 emergent procedures requiring laparotomy, 852,821 emergent cesarean sections, and 210,657 open, long bone fracture repairs. Pooled perioperative mortality for all of the bellwether procedures was correlated with all-procedure POMR among states (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). POMR for emergency procedures (2.4%) correlated with the all-procedure (emergent and elective) POMR (1.6%, r = 0.93, p < .001), while POMR for elective procedures (0.4%) did not (p = .247). POMR for emergency laparotomy (4.4%) correlated with all-procedure POMR (1.6%, r = 0.52, p = .005), as did the POMR for open, long bone fractures (0.8%, r = 0.61, p < .001). POMR for emergency cesarean section (0.05%) did not correlate with all-procedure POMR (p = 0.400). There was a correlation between surgical volume and emergency laparotomy POMR (r = - 0.53, p = .004), but not for emergency cesarean section or open, long bone fractures POMR. Conclusion Procedure-specific POMR for laparotomy and open long bone fracture correlates modestly with all-procedure POMR among Brazilian states which is primarily driven by emergency procedure POMR. Selective reporting of emergency laparotomy and open fracture POMR may be a useful surrogate to guide subnational surgical policy decisions.;Bellwether Procedures for Monitoring Subnational Variation of All-cause Perioperative Mortality in Brazil;Truche, P., Roa, L., Citron, I., Caddell, L., Neto, J., Reis, M., Moore, E., Botelho, F., Alonso, N., Watters, D.;2020;WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY;6;10.1007/s00268-020-05607-x;;"[Truche, Paul; Roa, Lina; Citron, Isabelle; Caddell, Luke; Reis, Matheus] Harvard Med Sch, Program Global Surg & Social Change, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Roa, Lina] Univ Alberta, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Neto, Joao] Univ Sao Paulo, FMUSP, Fac Med, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Moore, Eileen] Deakin Univ, Dept Surg, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Moore, Eileen; Watters, David] Barwon Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Botelho, Fabio] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Alonso, Nivaldo] Univ Sao Paulo, Div Plast Surg, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Watters, David] Deakin Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia";;"MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; GLOBAL SURGERY; EMERGENCY LAPAROTOMY; SURGICAL MORTALITY; LANCET COMMISSION; CESAREAN DELIVERY; HEALTH; INDICATOR; RELIABILITY; ACCESS";"MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES;GLOBAL SURGERY;EMERGENCY LAPAROTOMY;SURGICAL MORTALITY;LANCET COMMISSION;CESAREAN DELIVERY;HEALTH;INDICATOR;RELIABILITY;ACCESS";Brazil;"- Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE.

46;"Objective: To describe and compare the number of surgeries, mortality rate, length of hospital stay, and costs of transurethral resection of the prostate and open prostatectomy for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, between 2008 and 2018, in the Public Health System in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Ecological and retrospective study using data from the informatics department of the Brazilian Public Health System database. Procedure codes were ""open prostatectomy"" and ""transurethral resection of the prostate."" The outcomes analyzed were compared between transurethral resection of the prostate and open prostatectomy according to the hospital surgical volume and presence or absence of a residency program. Results: A total of 18,874 surgeries were analyzed (77% transurethral resection of the prostate) and overall mortality was not statistically different between procedures. Intermediate and high-volume centers had shorter length of hospital stay than low-volume centers for transurethral resection of the prostate (3.28, 3.02, and 6.58 days, respectively, p=0.01 and p=0.004). Length of hospital stay was also shorter for open prostatectomy in high-volume compared to low-volume centers (4.86 versus 10.76 days, p=0.036). Intrahospital mortality was inversely associated with surgical volume for transurethral resection of the prostate. Centers with residency program had shorter length of hospital stay considering open prostatectomy and less mortality regarding transurethral resection of the prostate. Open prostatectomy was 64% more expensive than transurethral resection of the prostate. Conclusion: The findings suggest the importance of investing in specialized centers, which could be potential referral centers for surgical cases.";Benign prostatic hyperplasia surgical treatment trends in the Public Health System in Sao Paulo, Brazil;Barbosa, A.R.G., Takemura, L.S., Amaral, B.S., Wroclawski, M.L., Alfer, W., Gil, A.O., Monteiro, J., Lourenco, D.B., Cha, J.D., Apezzato, M., Barbosa, J.A.B.A., Bianco, B., Lemos, G.C., Carneiro, A.;2022;EINSTEIN-SAO PAULO;0;10.31744/einstein_journal/2022AO6880;;"[Gomes Barbosa, Alan Roger; Takemura, Lucas Seiti; Amaral, Breno Santos; Wroclawski, Marcelo Langer; Alfer, Wladimir, Jr.; Gil, Antonio Otero; Monteiro, Jose, Jr.; Lourenco, Danilo Budib; Cha, Jonathan Doyun; Apezzato, Marcelo; Brunhara Alves Barbosa, Joao Arthur; Bianco, Bianca; Lemos, Gustavo Caserta; Carneiro, Arie] Hosp Israelita Albert Einstein, Ave Albert Einstein,627-701,Room 303,Bldg A1, BR-05652900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil";"Prostatic hyperplasia; Transurethral resection of prostate; Prostatectomy; Postoperative complications; Treatment outcome; Length of stay; Mortality";"URINARY-TRACT SYMPTOMS; PROSTATECTOMY";"Prostatic hyperplasia;Transurethral resection of prostate;Prostatectomy;Postoperative complications;Treatment outcome;Length of stay;Mortality;URINARY-TRACT SYMPTOMS";Brazil;- Brazilian Public Health System Database (DATASUS) (https://datasus.saude.gov.br/);Tabular;Open;No;Brazil;yes

53;"OBJECTIVE: To report the decrease in breast imaging after covid-19 pandemic, obtaining the number of mammograms performed in 2019 and 2020. Additionally, to investigate if there was an increase in the proportion of women undergoing mammography for diagnostic purposes, with palpable lesions. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study, based on the number of mammograms performed by the Brazilian public health services, provided by DATASUS, an open access database. Mammograms from private institutions were not included. This study compares the number of mammograms performed in 2019 and 2020, in women aged 50-69 years, stratified by month, in each federal state, and the presence of palpable lumps (physician-reported). RESULTS: In total, 1,948,471 mammograms were performed in 2019 and 1,126,688 in 2020, for the population studied. These values represent a 42% decline. Monthly, a significant decreased is observed after April 2020. The results varied slightly according to federal state; yet the entire country was affected. Rondonia was the most affected state, with 67% decline. The proportion of women presenting palpable lumps increased from 7.06% on average in 2019 to 7.94% in 2020 (OR = 1.135, 95%CI 1.125-1.145, p = 0,001). DISCUSSION: The number of mammograms performed in 2020 declined considerably. Out of the women who presented for mammogram, the proportion of palpable lumps was significantly higher in 2020. Considering the detection rate of digital mammography, the loss of 800,000 exams means 4,000 undiagnosed breast cancer cases, by the end of 2020.";Breast imaging hindered during covid-19 pandemic, in Brazil;Bessa, J.D.;2021;REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA;9;10.11606/s1518-8787.2021055003375;;[Bessa, Jordana de Faria] Hosp Sao Luiz, Matter Grp Assistencia Med, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil;"Mammography, statistics & numerical data; Breast Neoplasms diagnosis; Coronavirus Infections; State Health Care Coverage";"CANCER SURVIVAL; SURVEILLANCE; MAMMOGRAPHY";"Mammography, statistics & numerical data;Breast Neoplasms diagnosis;Coronavirus Infections;State Health Care Coverage;CANCER SURVIVAL;SURVEILLANCE;MAMMOGRAPHY";Brazil;- Brazilian Public Health System Database (DATASUS) (https://datasus.saude.gov.br/);Tabular;Open;No;Brazil;yes
56;Purpose: To collect cataract surgery rates data in 19 Latin American countries over a 4-year period as data published to date have been limited. Methods: Cataract surgery rates were obtained from National Society of Ophthalmology, National VISION 2020/Prevention of Blindness Committee and Ministry of Health representatives for each country for 2005 to 2008. Economic (gross national income per capita) and other data were collected from publicly available databases. Linear and power correlations between gross national incomes and cataract surgery rates were calculated. Results: Over the study period, most countries increased their cataract surgery rates, with the largest increases observed for Venezuela (186%), Nicaragua (183%), Costa Rica (100%), Uruguay (97%), and Peru (88%). Mean cataract surgery rates for 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 for the ensemble of countries were 1545, 1684, 1660, and 1822 per million population, respectively, with a growth over the study period of 17.9%, concurrent with an increase of 57 million (11.5%) in the population. A good correlation between cataract surgery rate and gross national income per capita was found (P <.001). Conclusions: Although progress is being made in the region, the cataract surgery rates represent only one parameter. When they are examined in the context of cataract surgical coverage it is clear that substantial proportions of bilaterally blind persons are still not receiving surgery. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.;Cataract surgery rates in Latin America: A four-year longitudinal study of 19 countries;Lansingh V.C., Resnikoff S., Tingley-Kelley K., Nano M.E., Martens M., Silva J.C., Duerksen R., Carter M.J.;2010;Ophthalmic Epidemiology;40;10.3109/09286581003624962;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77950175019&doi=10.3109%2f09286581003624962&partnerID=40&md5=ad8ef112159d0bdae6a385b3dd2d96b4;"Fundacion Hugo Nano, International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, VISION 2020 la Office, Buenos Aires, Argentina; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland; Strategic Solutions, Inc., 1143 Salsbury Ave, Cody, WY 82414, United States; Pan American Health Organization, Santa Fe de Bogotá DC, Colombia; Fundacion Vision, Asuncion, Paraguay";"Cataract extraction/rate; Correlation of data; Latin America; Ophthalmologist; Socioeconomic factors";"article; blindness; cataract; cataract extraction; controlled study; health economics; health service; human; income; information processing; medical society; priority journal; South and Central America; Cataract; Cataract Extraction; Databases, Factual; Delivery of Health Care; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Latin America; Longitudinal Studies; Ophthalmology";"Cataract extraction/rate;Correlation of data;Latin America;Ophthalmologist;Socioeconomic factors;article;blindness;cataract;cataract extraction;controlled study;health economics;health service;human;income;information processing;medical society;priority journal;South and Central America;Databases, Factual;Delivery of Health Care;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Ophthalmology";19 South and Central America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela);"- Data on Gross National Income (GNI) from the World Bank.

58;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association among characteristics of primary health care center (PHCC) with hospitalizations for primary care sensitive conditions (PCSC) in Brazil. METHOD: In this study, a cross-sectional ecological study was performed. This study analyzed the 27 capitals of Brazil's federative units. Data were aggregated from the following open access databases: National Program for Access and Quality Improvement in Primary Care, the Hospital Information System of Brazilian Unified Health System and Annual Population Census conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Associations were estimated among characteristics of primary care with the number of three PCSC as the leading causes of hospitalization in children under-5 population in Brazil: asthma, diarrhea, and pneumonia. RESULTS: In general, PHCC showed limited structural adequacy (37.3%) for pediatric care in Brazil. The capitals in South and Southeast regions had the best structure whereas the North and Northeast had the worst. Fewer PCSC hospitalizations were significantly associated with PHCC which presented appropriate equipment (RR: 0.98; 95%CI: 0.97-0.99), structural conditions (RR: 0.98; 95%CI: 0.97-0.99), and signage/identification of professionals and facilities (RR: 0.98; 95%CI: 0.97-0.99). Higher PCSC hospitalizations were significantly associated with PHCC with more physicians (RR: 1.23, 95%CI: 1.02-1.48), it forms (RR: 1.01, 95%CI: 1.01-1.02), and more medications (RR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01-1.03). CONCLUSION: Infrastructural adequacy of PHCC was associated with less PCSC hospitalizations, while availability medical professional and medications were associated with higher PCSC hospitalizations.

66;Objectives: This study aims to describe the incidence of ocular involvement in patients with toxoplasmo-sis and describe the sociodemographic characteristics by age, sex, and region in Colombia, based on the National Health Registry of data between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using the Integrated Social Protection Information Sys-tem database from the Colombian Ministry of Health, the unique official database in the country. We used the International Classification of Diseases for all codes of toxoplasmosis with a specific filter for ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) from 2015 to 2019 to estimate the incidence and the demographic status of the disease in Colombia.Results: During the 5 years of study, the crude unadjusted incidence of OT was 42.02 (Confidence In-terval 30.29-56.19) cases in 1,0 0 0 patients with toxoplasmosis per year, showing a significant increase of incidence when comparing the year 2019 to the year 2015. There was a predominance of female patients (58% of the cases). The distribution by age shows an increase in cases of the disease in subjects aged 15 to 49 years (65.2%).

72;"Acute appendicitis is the leading cause of abdominal emergency surgery worldwide and appendectomy continues to be the definitive treatment of choice. This cost-effectiveness analysis evaluates laparoscopic versus open appendectomies performed in public health services in the state of Bahia (Brazil). We conducted a retrospective observational study using the database from the Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (DATASUS). Available data on appendectomies between 2008 and 2019 were included, and we evaluated the temporal trend of hospital admissions, procedure-related mortality rates, length of stay, and costs. Statistical analysis was performed using the R-software (R Foundation, v.4.0.3) and the BioEstat software (IMDS, v. 5.3), considering p<0.05 as significant. During 2008-2019, 53,024 appendectomies were performed in the public health services in Bahia, of which 94.9% were open surgeries. The open technique was associated with a higher mortality rate (4.9/1,000 procedures; p<0.05) and a higher risk of death (RR=4.5; p<0.05) compared to laparoscopy (1.1/1,000 procedures). Laparoscopic appendectomy (median of 2.7 days) had a shorter length of stay compared to laparotomy (median of 4.15 days) (p<0.05). There was no difference in the medians of costs nor hospital services, per procedure (p=0.08 and p=0.08, respectively). Laparoscopic professional median costs were higher by US$ 1.39 (p<0.05). Minimally invasive surgery for appendicitis is a safe and efficacious procedure in Brazilian public health care services, as it provides advantages over the open method (including lower procedure-related mortality rate and earlier discharges), and it did not imply higher expenses for public service budgets in the state of Bahia. © 2021, Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes.

76;Background: Brazil is an upper middle-income country in South America with the world's sixth largest population. Despite great advances in health-care services and cardiac surgical care in both its public and private health systems, little is known on the volume, outcomes, and trends of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in Brazil's public health system. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of CABG on the public health system from January 2008 to December 2017 through the database DATASUS. Methods: This study is based on publicly available material obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian Ministry of Health's data processing system, on numbers of surgical procedures, death rates, length of stay, and costs. Only isolated CABG procedures were included in our study. We used the TabNet software from the DATASUS website to generate reports. The chi(2) test was used to compare death rates. A p < .05 was considered statistically significant. Results: We identified 226,697 CABG procedures performed from January 2008 to December 2017. The overall in-hospital mortality over the 10-year period was 5.7%. We observed statistically significant differences in death rates between the five Brazilian macro-regions. Death rates by state ranged from 2.6% to 13.1%. The national average mortality rate remained stable over the course of time. Conclusion: Over 10 years, a high volume of CABG was performed in the Brazilian Public Health System, with significant differences in mortality, number of procedures, and distribution of surgeries by region. Future databases involving all centers that perform CABG and carry out risk-adjusted analysis will help improve Brazilian results and enable policymakers to adopt appropriate health-care policies for greater transparency and accountability.;Coronary artery bypass graft surgery in Brazil from 2008 to 2017;Khalil, K.H., Sa, M.P.B.O., Vervoort, D., Roever, L., Pires, M.A.D., Lima, J.M.D., de Salles, F.B., Khalil, G.M., Nicz, P.F.G., Mejia, O.A.V., Okino, A.A., Lima, R.D.;2021;JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY;3;10.1111/jocs.15328;;"[Hussein Khalil, Kalil; de Andrade Pires, Marcos Alfredo; de Oliveira Lima, Jaqueline Maria; Munhoz Khalil, Giovana; Akio Okino, Arnaldo] Hosp Norte Paranaense, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Arapongas, Parana, Brazil; [B.

77;"Objectives: Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the gold standard for the surgical treatment of localized prostate cancer, presenting better results than radiotherapy especially for high-risk patients. Although it has clinical and technical benefits compared with open and laparoscopic techniques, the robotic-assisted RP is not publicly funded in Brazil. The objective of this study was to calculate the cost-effectiveness of the robotic-assisted RP from the Brazilian public system perspective. Methods: A state transition model was built to simulate the life of a patient undergoing RP. A total of 3 arms were compared: robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open surgeries. The assumed time horizon was 20 years; discounts were applied to both costs and health outcomes. Events and transition probabilities were obtained in the literature, and costs were obtained in official government databases. The results were reported as incremental cost-utility ratios. Results: Robotic-assisted surgery was found to be costlier but more effective than both open and laparoscopic techniques, resulting in Brazilian reals 4518 per quality-adjusted life-year and Brazilian reals 3631 per quality-adjusted life-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, respectively. Conclusions: This study gives relevant inputs for decision making regarding the inclusion of robotic-assisted RP in the Brazilian public formularies. The study demonstrates that the technology is cost-effective even when considering willingness-to-pay thresholds lower than the traditionally used ones. © 2021 ISPOR—The professional society for health economics and outcomes research";Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer From the Brazilian Public System Perspective;Faria E.F., Rosim R.P., de Matos Nogueira E., Tobias-Machado M.;2022;Value in Health Regional Issues;1;10.1016/j.vhri.2021.06.009;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119376916&doi=10.1016%2fj.vhri.2021.06.009&partnerID=40&md5=e44275be514b3195be18510ed843a72a;"Department of Urology, Hospital Felicio Rocho, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; ValueConnected, São Paulo, Brazil; ICAVC – Cancer Institute Dr. Arnaldo, São Paulo, Brazil; Department of Urology, ABC Medical School, São Paulo, Brazil";"cost-effectiveness analysis; Da Vinci Surgical System; prostate cancer; radical prostatectomy; robotic-assisted surgery";"aged; Article; Brazil; cancer surgery; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; human; intermethod comparison; laparoscopic surgery; life; male; open surgery; prostate cancer; quality adjusted life year; robot-assisted prostatectomy; very elderly; adverse event; cost benefit analysis; procedures; prostate tumor; prostatectomy; robot assisted surgery; Brazil; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Male; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Robotic Surgical Procedures";"cost-effectiveness analysis;Da Vinci Surgical System;prostate cancer;radical prostatectomy;robotic-assisted surgery;aged;Article;Brazil;cancer surgery;clinical effectiveness;clinical outcome;cohort analysis;cost effectiveness analysis;cost utility analysis;human;intermethod comparison;laparoscopic surgery;life;male;open surgery;quality adjusted life year;robot-assisted prostatectomy;very elderly;adverse event;cost benefit analysis;procedures;prostate tumor;prostatectomy;robot assisted surgery;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Humans;Prostatic Neoplasms;Robotic Surgical Procedures";Brazil;"- Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE.

79;Fact-checking verifies a multitude of claims and remains a promising solution to fight fake news. The spread of rumors, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories online is evident in times of crisis, when fake news ramped up across platforms, increasing fear and confusion among the population as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. This article explores fact-checking initiatives in Latin America, using an original Markov-based computational method to cluster topics on tweets and identify their diffusion between different datasets. Drawing on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods, including time-series analysis, network analysis and in-depth close reading, our article proposes an in-depth tracing of COVID-related false information across the region, comparing if there is a pattern of behavior through the countries. We rely on the open Twitter application programming interface connection to gather data from public accounts of the six major fact-checking agencies in Latin America, namely Argentina (Chequeado), Brazil (Agência Lupa), Chile (Mala Espina Check), Colombia (Colombia Check from Consejo de Redacciín), Mexico (El Sabueso from Animal Polótico) and Venezuela (Efecto Cocuyo). In total, these profiles account for 102,379 tweets that were collected between January and July 2020. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of online information dissemination beyond the national level and demonstrates how politics intertwine with the health crisis in this period. Our method is capable of clustering topics in a period of overabundance of information, as we fight not only a pandemic but also an infodemic, evidentiating opportunities to understand and slow the spread of false information. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.;COVID-19 fake news diffusion across Latin America;Ceron W., Gruszynski Sanseverino G., de-Lima-Santos M.F., Quiles M.G.;2021;Social Network Analysis and Mining;21;10.1007/s13278-021-00753-z;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106274858&doi=10.1007%2fs13278-021-00753-z&partnerID=40&md5=52d409e380d16dbe8b35a98ee4ff9204;"Federal University of Sao Paulo, Av.

81;Objective. The aim of this study is to describe the mortality among older adults in the first wave of COVID-19 in Colombia and Mexico. Methods. This is an observational, prospective study on data obtained from open data sets that are publicly available on the websites of the health ministries of the respective countries. COVID-19 cases, age, sex, date to mortality, and mortality itself were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regressions. Results. Data on 1 779 877 individuals were analyzed, 58.2% from Mexico, with a higher frequency of men for both countries, and 11.7% were older adults. Survival curves show a continuous increase in mortality for Mexico, with higher rates for older adults, while for Colombia the mortality was observed up to 50 days of the follow-up. Finally, hazard ratios were higher for older adults in both countries. Colombia implemented a rigid curfew for older adults, and the effect on mortality is clear from the survival curves. Conclusions. This finding shows the potential benefit that public policies could have on older adults. © 2021 Pan American Health Organization.

82;"Background This is an exploratory analysis of potential variables associated with open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery hospitalization resource use pattern. Methods Cross-sectional study based on an administrative database (DATASUS) records. Inclusion criteria were adult patients undergoing RYGB between Jan/2008 and Jun/2011. Dependent variables were length of stay (LoS) and ICU need. Independent variables were: gender, age, region, hospital volume, surgery at certified center of excellence (CoE) by the Surgical Review Corporation (SRC), teaching hospital, and year of hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate analysis (logistic regression for ICU need and linear regression for length of stay) were performed. Results Data from 13,069 surgeries were analyzed. In crude analysis, hospital volume was the most impactful variable associated with log-transformed LoS (1.312 +/- 0.302 high volume vs. 1.670 +/- 0.581 low volume, p < 0.001), whereas for ICU need it was certified CoE (odds ratio (OR), 0.016; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.010-0.026). After adjustment by logistic regression, certified CoE remained as the strongest predictor of ICU need (OR, 0.011; 95 % CI, 0.007-0.018), followed by hospital volume (OR, 3.096; 95 % CI, 2.861-3.350). Age group, male gender, and teaching hospital were also significantly associated (p < 0.001). For log-transformed LoS, final model includes hospital volume (coefficient, -0.223; 95 % CI, -0.250 to -0.196) and teaching hospital (coefficient, 0.375; 95 % CI, 0.351-0.398). Region of Brazil was not associated with any of the outcomes. Conclusions High-volume hospital was the strongest predictor for shorter LoS, whereas SRC certification was the strongest predictor of lower ICU need.

85;Understanding the fine scale spatial distribution of births and pregnancies is crucial for informing planning decisions related to public health. This is especially important in lower income countries where infectious disease is a major concern for pregnant women and new-borns, as highlighted by the recent Zika virus epidemic. Despite this, the spatial detail of basic data on the numbers and distribution of births and pregnancies is often of a coarse resolution and difficult to obtain, with no co-ordination between countries and organisations to create one consistent set of subnational estimates. To begin to address this issue, under the framework of the WorldPop program, an open access archive of high resolution gridded birth and pregnancy distribution datasets for all African, Latin America and Caribbean countries has been created. Datasets were produced using the most recent and finest level census and official population estimate data available and are at a resolution of 30 arc seconds (approximately 1 km at the equator).

86;This study aims to identify patterns in maternal and fetal characteristics in the prediction of infant mortality by incorporating innovative techniques like data mining, with proven relevance for public health. A database was developed with infant deaths from 2000 to 2004 analyzed by the Committees for the Prevention of Infant Mortality, based on integration of the Information System on Live Births (SINASC), Mortality Information System, and Investigation of Infant Mortality in the State of Parana. The data mining software was WEKA (open source). The data mining conducts a database search and provides rules to be analyzed to transform the data into useful information. After mining, 4,230 rules were selected: teenage pregnancy plus birth weight < 2,500g, or post-term birth plus teenage mother with a previous child or intercurrent conditions increase the risk of neonatal death. The results highlight the need for greater attention to teenage mothers, newborns with birth weight < 2,500g, post-term neonates, and infants of mothers with intercurrent conditions, thus corroborating other studies.;Data mining and characteristics of infant mortality;Vianna, R.C.X.F., Moro, C.M.C.D., Moyses, S.J., Carvalho, D., Nievola, J.C.;2010;CADERNOS DE SAUDE PUBLICA;12;10.1590/S0102-311X2010000300011;;"[Xavier Ferreira Vianna, Rossana Cristina] Secretaria Estado Saude Parana, BR-80230140 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Xavier Ferreira Vianna, Rossana Cristina; Cabral de Barra Moro, Claudia Maria; Moyses, Samuel Jorge; Carvalho, Deborah; Nievola, Julio Cesar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Programa Posgrad Tecnol Saude, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Moyses, Samuel Jorge] Secretaria Municipal Saude Curitiba, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Carvalho, Deborah] Univ Tuiuti, Inst Paranaense Desenvolvimento Econ & Social, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil";"Database; Infant Mortality; Information Systems; Artificial Intelligence; Epidemiologic Surveillance";"BRAZIL; FETAL";"Database;Infant Mortality;Information Systems;Artificial Intelligence;Epidemiologic Surveillance;BRAZIL;FETAL";Brazil;Information System on Live Births (SINASC);Tabular;Open;No;Brazil;yes

88;Due to the increasing prevalence of obesity and its negative consequences worldwide on public health, body composition analysis is a central pillar to assess the nutritional status. Scientists could use datasets to develop a new body fat measurement formula. Using bioelectrical impedance analysis, we analyzed the total body composition of 345 patients (234 men and 111 women) aged between 18 and 60 years residing in the metropolitan area of Barranquilla, Colombia. They have the potential for predictive formula analysis enhancing the cooperation among scientists. Due to the obesity pandemic, new datasets from other populations are needed to develop a body fat basic mathematical equation formula that could be used worldwide to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity in a specific population group predisposed to develop metabolic syndrome or death, secondary to high cardiovascular risk.

94;Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths. At later stages, it is impossible to cure. However, if the early symptoms of cancer are identified using diagnostic methods, there is a possibility of treatment and gradual cure. In order to aid in the diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas, the application of Artificial Intelligence was viewed as a solution. Initially, various machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Twin Support Vector Machines and RadSTM-ER were used, yielding encouraging results. However, the arduous process of feature extraction and manual feature selection resulted in researchers turning towards deep learning methods. This research work uses ultrasound images of the pancreas obtained from an open sourced database by the gastroenterology unit of National University of Colombia. The implementation was carried out using transfer learning on Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Networks (DenseNets). DenseNet201 using pretrained weights of ImageNet was fine-tuned on 26469 pancreatic ultrasound images consisting of three categories: cancer, healthy and pancreatitis. Additionally, cross validation on 2940 images yielded an accuracy of 99.87 %. Apart from this, 9804 images of the same distribution were used to test the performance. The DenseNet201 model was able to yield an accuracy of 99.877 %, a sensitivity of 0.9987, a specificity of 0.99931 and a positive prediction value of 0.99877, with only 12 out of 9804 misclassified examples. The ability of deep transfer learning on DenseNet201 to generalize exceedingly well encourages its beta testing on real time data and subsequent deployment. © 2021 IEEE.;Deep Transfer Learning for Pancreatic Cancer Detection;Baldota S., Sharma S., Malathy C.;2021;2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies, ICCCNT 2021;1;10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9580000;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126196577&doi=10.1109%2fICCCNT51525.2021.9580000&partnerID=40&md5=d5cb97056537b3ac9397647544e5110a;Department of Computer Science and Engineering, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur603203, India;"Deep Learning; DenseNets; Fine tuning; Pancreatic Cancer; Transfer Learning";"Convolutional neural networks; Curing; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Support vector machines; Ultrasonic applications; Cancer detection; Causes of death; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Densely connected convolutional neural network; Fine tuning; Late stage; Pancreatic cancers; Transfer learning; Ultrasound images; Diseases";"Deep Learning;DenseNets;Fine tuning;Pancreatic Cancer;Transfer Learning;Convolutional neural networks;Curing;Feature extraction;Learning algorithms;Support vector machines;Ultrasonic applications;Cancer detection;Causes of death;Convolutional neural network;Densely connected convolutional neural network;Late stage;Pancreatic cancers;Ultrasound images;Diseases";Colombia;Endoscopic ultrasound database of the pancreas. http://cimalab.unal.edu.co/?lang=es&mod=program&id=26;Images - B-mode Ultrasound;Open;No;India;no
98;Background: This study analyzed several political determinants of increased private-sector management in Brazilian health care. In Brazil, the poor depend almost exclusively on the public Unified Health System (the SUS), which remains severely underfunded. Given the overhead costs associated with privately contracted health services, increased private management is one driver of higher expenditures in the system. Although left parties campaign most vocally in support of greater public control of the SUS, the extent to which their stated positions translate into health care policy remains untested. Methods: Drawing on multiple publicly available data sources, we used linear regression to analyze how political party-in-power and existing private sector health care contracting affect the share of privately managed health care services and outsourcing in municipalities. Data from two election periods - 2004 to 2008 and 2008 to 2012 - were analyzed. Results: Our findings showed that although private sector contracting varies greatly across municipalities, this variation is not systematically associated with political party in power. This suggests that electoral politics plays a relatively minor role in municipal-level health care administration. Existing levels of private sector management appear to have a greater effect on the public-private makeup of the Brazilian healthcare system, suggesting a strong role of path dependence in the evolution of Brazilian health care delivery. Conclusion: Despite campaign rhetoric asserting distinct positions on privatization in the SUS, factors other than political party in power have a greater effect on private-sector health system management at the municipal-level in Brazil. Given the limited effect of elections on this issue, strengthening participatory bodies such as municipal health councils may better enfranchise citizens in the fundamental debate over public and private roles in the health care sector. © 2017 The Author(s).;Do elections matter for private-sector healthcare management in Brazil?

99;Introduction: The Brazilian childhood National Immunization Program (NIP) introduced live and attenuated varicella vaccination in a single dose, combined as tetraviral vaccine, at 15 months of age in the whole country, during September to December of 2013. The aim of this study was to report trends in incidence of childhood hospital admissions related to varicella and zoster in Brazil from 2003 to 2016, including the first three years after vaccine introduction. Methods: The number and incidence of hospital admission in patients aged less than 20 years in Brazilian public health system with an admission diagnosis of varicella and zoster from 2003 to 2016 were analyzed and pre (2003-2013) and post-vaccination periods (2014-2016) were compared. The data were obtained from DATASUS, a Brazilian government's open-access public health database system, and analyzed adjusting for secular trend and seasonality if a statistically significant change was found. Results: During the study period, 69,791 admissions due to varicella and herpes zoster occurred in the children younger than 20 years. After adjusting for seasonality, the incidence of hospitalizations decreased from 27.33 to 14.33 per 100000 per year, which corresponds to a reduction of 47.6% (95% confidence interval 18.19-77.04%, p < 0.001) in the vaccinated age group (1-4 years) in 2014-2016 compared to pre-vaccination period. The changes were not significant in the unvaccinated age groups. Conclusion: The hospitalizations due to varicella and herpes zoster were decreased by half early after the introduction of a single dose of tetraviral vaccine in NIP in the vaccinated children. Further studies may assess duration and intensity of this effect, as well as the indirect effect in the unvaccinated age groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

103;Background COVID-19 spread rapidly in Brazil despite the country's well established health and social protection systems. Understanding the relationships between health-system preparedness, responses to COVID-19, and the pattern of spread of the epidemic is particularly important in a country marked by wide inequalities in socioeconomic characteristics (eg, housing and employment status) and other health risks (age structure and burden of chronic disease). Methods From several publicly available sources in Brazil, we obtained data on health risk factors for severe COVID-19 (proportion of the population with chronic disease and proportion aged >= 60 years), socioeconomic vulnerability (proportions of the population with housing vulnerability or without formal work), health-system capacity (numbers of intensive care unit beds and physicians), coverage of health and social assistance, deaths from COVID-19, and state-level responses of government in terms of physical distancing policies. We also obtained data on the proportion of the population staying at home, based on locational data, as a measure of physical distancing adherence. We developed a socioeconomic vulnerability index (SVI) based on household characteristics and the Human Development Index. Data were analysed at the state and municipal levels. Descriptive statistics and correlations between state-level indicators were used to characterise the relationship between the availability of health-care resources and socioeconomic characteristics and the spread of the epidemic and the response of governments and populations in terms of new investments, legislation, and physical distancing. We used linear regressions on a municipality-by-month dataset from February to October, 2020, to characterise the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths and response to the epidemic across municipalities. Findings The initial spread of COVID-19 was mostly affected by patterns of socioeconomic vulnerability as measured by the SVI rather than population age structure and prevalence of health risk factors. The states with a high (greater than median) SVI were able to expand hospital capacity, to enact stringent COVID-19-related legislation, and to increase physical distancing adherence in the population, although not sufficiently to prevent higher COVID-19 mortality during the initial phase of the epidemic compared with states with a low SVI. Death rates accelerated until June, 2020, particularly in municipalities with the highest socioeconomic vulnerability. Throughout the following months, however, differences in policy response converged in municipalities with lower and higher SVIs, while physical distancing remained relatively higher and death rates became relatively lower in the municipalities with the highest SVIs compared with those with lower SVIs. Interpretation In Brazil, existing socioeconomic inequalities, rather than age, health status, and other risk factors for COVID-19, have affected the course of the epidemic, with a disproportionate adverse burden on states and municipalities with high socioeconomic vulnerability. Local government responses and population behaviour in the states and municipalities with higher socioeconomic vulnerability have helped to contain the effects of the epidemic. Targeted policies and actions are needed to protect those with the greatest socioeconomic vulnerability. This experience could be relevant in other low-income and middle-income countries where socioeconomic vulnerability varies greatly.Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

104;Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused societal disruption globally, and South America has been hit harder than other lower-income regions. This study modeled the effects of six weather variables on district-level SARS-CoV-2 reproduction numbers (Rt) in three contiguous countries of tropical Andean South America (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru), adjusting for environmental, policy, healthcare infrastructural and other factors. Methods: Daily time-series data on SARS-CoV-2 infections were sourced from the health authorities of the three countries at the smallest available administrative level. Rt values were calculated and merged by date and unit ID with variables from a unified COVID-19 dataset and other publicly available sources for May–December, 2020. Generalized additive models were fitted. Findings: Relative humidity and solar radiation were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 Rt. Days with radiation above 1000 kJ/m2 saw a 1.3% reduction in Rt, and those with humidity above 50% recorded a 0.9% reduction in Rt. Transmission was highest in densely populated districts, and lowest in districts with poor healthcare access and on days with lowest population mobility. Wind speed, temperature, region, aggregate government policy response, and population age structure had little impact. The fully adjusted model explained 4.3% of Rt variance. Interpretation: Dry atmospheric conditions of low humidity increase district-level SARS-CoV-2 reproduction numbers, while higher levels of solar radiation decrease district-level SARS-CoV-2 reproduction numbers — effects that are comparable in magnitude to population factors like lockdown compliance. Weather monitoring could be incorporated into disease surveillance and early warning systems in conjunction with more established risk indicators and surveillance measures.

105;Background: The benefits of treatment for many conditions are time dependent. The burden of these emergency care sensitive conditions (ECSCs) is especially high in low- and middle-income countries. Our objective was to analyze geospatial trends in ECSCs and characterize regional disparities in access to emergency care in Brazil. Methods: From publicly available datasets, we extracted data on patients assigned an ECSC-related ICD-10 code and on the country's emergency facilities from 2015-2019. Using ArcGIS, OpenStreetMap, and WorldPop, we created catchment areas corresponding to 180 minutes of driving distance from each hospital. We then used ArcGIS to characterize space-time trends in ECSC admissions and to complete an Origin-Destination analysis to determine the path from household to closest hospital. Findings: There were 1362 municipalities flagged as “hot spots,” areas with a high volume of ECSCs. Of those, 69.7% were more than 180 minutes (171 km) from the closest emergency facility. These municipalities were primarily located in the states of Minas Gerais, Bahia, Espiríto Santo, Tocantins, and Amapá. In the North region, only 69.1% of the population resided within 180 minutes of an emergency hospital. Interpretations: Significant geographical barriers to accessing emergency care exist in certain areas of Brazil, especially in peri-urban areas and the North region. One limitation of this approach is that geolocation was not possible in some areas and thus we are likely underestimating the burden of inadequate access. Subsequent work should evaluate ECSC mortality data.

108;"Introduction: Although endovascular correction is a promising perspective, the gold-standard treatment for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurisms and type-B dissections with visceral involvement remains open surgery, particularly due to its well- established long-term durability. This study aims to describe and evaluate public data from patients treated for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurism in the Brazilian public health system in a 12-year interval. Methods: Data from procedures performed between 2008 and 2019 were extracted from the national public database (Departamento de Informatica do Sistema Unico de Saude, or DATASUS) using web scraping techniques. Procedures were evaluated regarding the yearly frequency of elective or urgency surgeries, in-hospital mortality, and governmental costs. All tests were done with a level of significance P<0.05. Results:A total of 812 procedures were analyzed. Of all surgeries,67.98% were elective cases. There were 328 in-hospital deaths (mortality of 40.39%). In-hospital mortality was lower in elective procedures (26.92%) than in urgency procedures (46.74%) (P=0.008). Total governmental expenditure was $3.127.051,56 - an average of $3.774,22 for elective surgery and $3.791,93 for emergency surgery (P=0.999). Conclusion: The proportion of urgency procedures is higher than that recommended by international literature. Mortality was higher for urgent admissions, although governmental costs were equal for elective and urgent procedures; specialized referral centers should be considered by health policy makers.";Epidemiological Analysis of 12 Years of Open Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair in the Brazilian Public Health System;Anacleto, A.M., Morales, M.M., Teivelis, M.P., da Silva, M.F.A., Portugal, M.F.C., Szlejf, C., Amaro, E., Wolosker, N.;2022;BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY;0;10.21470/1678-9741-2021-0291;;"[Anacleto, Alexandre Maiera; Morales, Marcia Maria; Teivelis, Marcelo Passos; Alexandrino da Silva, Marcelo Fiorelli; Cassino Portugal, Maria Fernanda; Szlejf, Claudia; Amaro Junior, Edson; Wolosker, Nelson] Hosp Israelita Albert Einstein, Vasc & Endovasc Surg Div, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Anacleto, Alexandre Maiera; Morales, Marcia Maria] Hosp Beneficencia Portuguesa Sao Jose Do Rio Pret, Inst Angiol & Cirurgia Vasc INVASE, Sao Jose Do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil; [Teivelis, Marcelo Passos; Amaro Junior, Edson; Wolosker, Nelson] Fac Israelita Ciencias Saude Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Wolosker, Nelson] Univ Sao Paulo, Vasc & Endovasc Surg Div, Fac Med, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil";"Aortic Aneurysm; Aorta; Thoracic; Aneurysm; Dissecting; Health Expenditures; Hospital Mortality";"ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; UNITED-STATES; SURGERY; OUTCOMES";"Aortic Aneurysm;Aorta;Thoracic;Aneurysm;Dissecting;Health Expenditures;Hospital Mortality;ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT;UNITED-STATES;SURGERY;OUTCOMES";Brazil;Public Webpage of Departamento de Informatica do Sistema Unico de Saude (DATASUS);Tabular;Open;No;8 Brazil;yes
109;Background: Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide, with carotid atherosclerosis accounting for 10–20% of cases. In Brazil, the Public Health System provides care for roughly two-thirds of the population. No studies, however, have analysed large–scale results of carotid bifurcation surgery in Brazil. Methods: This study aimed to describe rates of carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed between 2008 and 2019 in the country through web scraping of publicly available databases. Results: Between 2008 and 2019, 37,424 carotid bifurcation revascularization procedures were performed, of which 22,578 were CAS (60.34%) and 14,846 (39.66%) were CEA. There were 620 in-hospital deaths (1.66%), 336 after CAS (1.48%) and 284 after CEA (1.92%) (P = 0.032). Governmental reimbursement was US$ 77,216,298.85 (79.31% of all reimbursement) for CAS procedures and US$ 20,143,009.63 (20.69%) for CEA procedures. The average cost per procedure for CAS (US$ 3,062.98) was higher than that for CEA (US$ 1,430.33) (P = 0.008). Conclusions: In Brazil, the frequency of CAS largely surpassed that of CEA. In-hospital mortality rates of CAS were significantly lower than those of CEA, although both had mortality rates within the acceptable rates as dictated by literature. The cost of CAS, however, was significantly higher. This is a pioneering analysis of carotid artery disease management in Brazil that provides, for the first time, preliminary insight into the fact that the low adoption of CEA in the country is in opposition to countries where utilization rates are higher for CEA than for CAS. © 2021;Epidemiological Analysis of 37,424 Carotid Artery Stenosis Intervention Procedures During 11 Years in the Public Health System in Brazil: Stenting has Been More Common Than Endarterectomy;Wolosker N., Portugal M.F.C., da Silva M.F.A., Massaud R., Amaro E., Jr, Jerussalmy C., Teivelis M.P.;2021;Annals of Vascular Surgery;1;10.1016/j.avsg.2021.05.011;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110452308&doi=10.1016%2fj.avsg.2021.05.011&partnerID=40&md5=205703f9f4919a4c98e92d3010da386c;"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil; Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo – USP, São Paulo, Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil";"Angioplasty; Carotid Stenosis; Endarterectomy; Revascularization";"Article; Brazil; carotid artery bifurcation; carotid artery obstruction; carotid artery stenting; carotid endarterectomy; comparative study; controlled study; human; in-hospital mortality; major clinical study; mortality rate; public health; reimbursement; revascularization; adverse event; Brazil; carotid artery obstruction; carotid endarterectomy; clinical practice; cost benefit analysis; cost control; diagnostic imaging; economics; endovascular surgery; epidemiology; hospital cost; hospital mortality; mortality; public health; public health systems research; retrospective study; stent; time factor; treatment outcome; Brazil; Carotid Stenosis; Cost Savings; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Endarterectomy, Carotid; Endovascular Procedures; Hospital Costs; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Public Health; Public Health Systems Research; Retrospective Studies; Stents; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome";"Angioplasty;Carotid Stenosis;Endarterectomy;Revascularization;Article;Brazil;carotid artery bifurcation;carotid artery obstruction;carotid artery stenting;carotid endarterectomy;comparative study;controlled study;human;in-hospital mortality;major clinical study;mortality rate;public health;reimbursement;adverse event;clinical practice;cost benefit analysis;cost control;diagnostic imaging;economics;endovascular surgery;epidemiology;hospital cost;hospital mortality;mortality;public health systems research;retrospective study;stent;time factor;treatment outcome;Cost Savings;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Endarterectomy, Carotid;Endovascular Procedures;Hospital Costs;Humans;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Retrospective Studies;Stents;Time Factors";Brazil;DATASUS;Tabular;Open;No;7 Brazil;yes
110;Objective: Despite the development of endovascular procedures, open repair remains the gold standard for the treatment of aortic thoracoabdominal aneurysms and some type B dissections, with well-established good outcomes and long-term durability at high-volume centers. The present study described and analyzed public data from patients treated in the public system in a 12-year interval, in a city where more than 5 million inhabitants depend on the Public Health System. Methods: Public data from procedures performed between 2008 and 2019 were extracted using web scraping techniques. The variables available in the database include sex, age, elective or emergency hospital admission, number of surgeries, in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and information on reimbursement values. Results: A total of 556 procedures were analyzed. Of these, 60.79% patients were men, and 41.18% were 65 years of age or older. Approximately 60% had a residential address registered in the municipality. Of all surgeries, 65.83% were elective cases. There were 178 in-hospital deaths (mortality of 32%). In the elective context, there were 98 deaths 26.78% versus 80 deaths (42.10%) in the emergency context (p=0.174). Mortality was lower in the hospitals that performed more surgeries. A total of USD 3,038,753.92 was paid, an average of USD 5,406.95 for elective surgery and USD 5,074.76 for emergency surgery (p=0.536). Conclusion: Mortality was no different between groups, and hospitals with higher volume presented more favorable outcomes.

111;"Background: Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide with approximately 5.7 million cases/year, and carotid atherosclerosis accounts for 10 to 20% of cases. Methods: In Brazil, the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde [SUS]) is a tax-funded public health care system that provides care for roughly half the population. São Paulo is the eighth largest city in the world with an estimated population of over 12 million people, of whom more than 5 million rely solely on SUS. This study aimed to describe rates of carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed between 2008 and 2017 in the city of São Paulo through web scraping of publicly available databases. Results: Three thousand seven hundred and four carotid revascularization procedures were performed between 2008 and 2017, of which 2,432 were CAS (65.7%). Rates of CAS ranged from 59.9% in 2016 to 86% in 2011. There were 57 in-hospital deaths (1.54%), 34 after CAS (1.4%; 34/2,432) and 23 after CEA (1.81%; 23/1,272) (P = 0.562). SUS reimbursements were US $7,862,017.09 (81.44% of all reimbursements) for 2,432 CAS procedures and US $1,792,324.06 (18.56%) for 1,272 CEA procedures. Average SUS reimbursement for CAS (US $3,232.73) was more than double than that for CEA (US $1,409.05). Conclusions: In a city whose population exceeds that of some European countries, costs of CAS and CEA to the public health care system totaled more than US$ 9 million over 10 years. Epidemiologically, CAS was performed more commonly than CEA with no difference in in-hospital mortality between CAS and CEA, but reimbursements were 2.29 times higher for CAS. The low adoption of CEA in São Paulo is in contrast to countries where utilization rates are higher for CEA than for CAS. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.";Epidemiological Analysis of Carotid Artery Stenosis Intervention during 10 years in the Public Health System in the Largest City in Brazil: Stenting Has Been More Common than Endarterectomy;Stabellini N., Wolosker N., Leiderman D.B.D., da Silva M.F.A., Nogueira W.A., Amaro E., Jr., Teivelis M.P.;2020;Annals of Vascular Surgery;7;10.1016/j.avsg.2019.12.040;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078990200&doi=10.1016%2fj.avsg.2019.12.040&partnerID=40&md5=2e8fe7ae99da9f3b15b7c65f40266a2a;"Faculdade Israelita de Ciências da Saúde Albert Einstein (FICSAE), Hospital Israelita -Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil";;"aged; Article; Brazil; carotid artery obstruction; carotid artery stenting; carotid atherosclerosis; carotid endarterectomy; cerebrovascular accident; comparative study; female; hospital mortality; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; priority journal; public health service; reimbursement; retrospective study; revascularization; adverse event; carotid artery obstruction; carotid endarterectomy; devices; endovascular surgery; epidemiology; factual database; hospital cost; mortality; public health; risk factor; stent; time factor; treatment outcome; Brazil; Carotid Stenosis; Databases, Factual; Endarterectomy, Carotid; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Hospital Costs; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Male; Public Health; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stents; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome";"aged;Article;Brazil;carotid artery obstruction;carotid artery stenting;carotid atherosclerosis;carotid endarterectomy;cerebrovascular accident;comparative study;female;hospital mortality;human;intermethod comparison;major clinical study;male;priority journal;public health service;reimbursement;retrospective study;revascularization;adverse event;devices;endovascular surgery;epidemiology;factual database;hospital cost;mortality;public health;risk factor;stent;time factor;treatment outcome;Carotid Stenosis;Databases, Factual;Endarterectomy, Carotid;Endovascular Procedures;Hospital Costs;Humans;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Stents;Time Factors";Brazil;DATASUS;Tabular;Open;No;7 Brazil;yes
112;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the public data of hysterectomies performed in the only health system in the city of Sao Paulo between 2008 and 2018. METHODS: The following public health system data were extracted and analyzed: age, technique, number of surgeries, mortality during hospitalization, length of stay in the establishment (days), and amounts paid by the public network. RESULTS: A total of 20,119 procedures were analyzed. The most prevalent procedure was total hysterectomy (43.2%), followed by vaginal hysterectomy (26.7%), subtotal hysterectomy (24.3%), and laparoscopic hysterectomy (5.8%). Early discharge (hospital stay of up to 1 day) was more prevalent in cases of vaginal hysterectomy (39%). We observed a marked downward trend in the number of total hysterectomies. Total hysterectomy was the most expensive procedure; no significant difference was noted in the cost of vaginal versus laparoscopic hysterectomy. We noticed a trend of rising costs over the years. The most frequent hospital admission code was that of leiomyoma of the uterus in cases of total, subtotal, and laparoscopic hysterectomy. CONCLUSION: Despite the decrease in the number of hysterectomies over the 11-year study period in Sao Paulo, it remains in high demand mainly for the treatment of uterine leiomyomatosis. Laparoscopic hysterectomy has been gaining ground and showed a slightly upward trend with a shorter hospital stay.

113;"Background: Worldwide, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a disorder with high morbidity, affecting more than 200 million people. Objectives: Our objective was to analyze surgical treatment for PAD provided on the Brazilian Public Healthcare System over 12 years using publicly available data. Methods: The study was conducted with analysis of data available on the Brazilian Health Ministry’s database platform, assessing distributions of procedures and techniques over the years and their associated mortality and costs. Results: A total of 129,424 procedures were analyzed (performed either for claudication or critical ischemia, proportion unknown). The vast majority of procedures were endovascular (65.49%) and this disproportion exhibited a rising trend (p<0.001). There were 3,306 in-hospital deaths (mortality of 2.55%), with lower mortality in the endovascular group (1.2% vs. 5.0%, p=0.008). The overall governmental expenditure on these procedures was U$ 238,010,096.51, and endovascular procedures were on average significantly more expensive than open surgery (U$ 1,932.27 vs. U$ 1,517.32; p=0.016). Conclusions: Lower limb revascularizations were performed on the Brazilian Public Healthcare System with gradually increasing frequency from 2008 to 2019.

114;Background: Varicose vein surgeries are the most commonly performed vascular procedure to treat the most prevalent vascular disease, chronic venous disease. However, nationwide studies on the epidemiology of varicose vein surgeries are scarce, none in developing countries. Therefore, we designed this study to assess the total number of varicose vein surgeries performed between 2008 and 2019 in the Public Health System, which exclusively insures more than 160 million Brazilians, their trends, costs and mortality rates. Methods: Public and open data referring to all surgeries to treat chronic venous disease between 2008 and 2019 were extracted from the Brazilian Ministry of Health database. Results: A total of 869,220 surgeries were performed to treat chronic venous disease in Brazilian public hospitals and outpatient clinics, with an average rate of 4.5 surgeries per 10,000 inhabitants per year. Starting in 2015, we observed a slight non-significant downward trend in the total number of procedures. The total amount reimbursed by the government was US$ 232,775,518.11. A total of 49 deaths were reported after varicose vein surgery, corresponding to a mortality rate of 0.0056%. Conclusions: A total of 869,220 surgeries were performed to treat chronic venous disease over twelve years, with an overall rate of 4.52 procedures per 10,000 population per year.

120;"Background Brazil ranks second worldwide in total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Understanding the possible socioeconomic and ethnic health inequities is particularly important given the diverse population and fragile political and economic situation. We aimed to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and assess variations in mortality according to region, ethnicity, comorbidities, and symptoms. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using data from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informacao de Vigilancia Epidemiologica da Gripe) dataset to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. In the study, we included hospitalised patients who had a positive RT-PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who had ethnicity information in the dataset. Ethnicity of participants was classified according to the five categories used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics: Branco (White), Preto (Black), Amarelo (East Asian), Indigeno (Indigenous), or Pardo (mixed ethnicity). We assessed regional variations in patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital by state and by two socioeconomically grouped regions (north and central-south). We used mixed-effects Cox regression survival analysis to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation. Findings Of 99 557 patients in the SIVEP-Gripe dataset, we included 11 321 patients in our study. 9278 (82 center dot 0%) of these patients were from the central-south region, and 2043 (18 center dot 0%) were from the north region. Compared with White Brazilians, Pardo and Black Brazilians with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1 center dot 45, 95% CI 1 center dot 33-1 center dot 58 for Pardo Brazilians; 1 center dot 32, 1 center dot 15-1 center dot 52 for Black Brazilians). Pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age) for death. Comorbidities were more common in Brazilians admitted to hospital in the north region than in the central-south, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups. States in the north had higher HRs compared with those of the central-south, except for Rio de Janeiro, which had a much higher HR than that of the other central-south states. Interpretation We found evidence of two distinct but associated effects: increased mortality in the north region (regional effect) and in the Pardo and Black populations (ethnicity effect). We speculate that the regional effect is driven by increasing comorbidity burden in regions with lower levels of socioeconomic development. The ethnicity effect might be related to differences in susceptibility to COVID-19 and access to health care (including intensive care) across ethnicities. Our analysis supports an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect Pardo and Black Brazilians, as well as the population of poorer states, from their higher risk of dying of COVID-19.

123;Objective: To use publicly available secondary data to assess the impact of Brazil's Family Health Program on state level infant mortality rates (IMR) during the 1990s. Design: Longitudinal ecological analysis using panel data from secondary sources. Analyses controlled for state level measures of access to clean water and sanitation, average income, women's literacy and fertility, physicians and nurses per 10 000 population, and hospital beds per 1000 population. Additional analyses controlled for immunisation coverage and tested interactions between Family Health Program and proportionate mortality from diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections. Setting: 13 years (1990-2002) of data from 27 Brazilian states. Main results: From 1990 to 2002 IMR declined from 49.7 to 28.9 per 1000 live births. During the same period average Family Health Program coverage increased from 0% to 36%. A 10% increase in Family Health Program coverage was associated with a 4.5% decrease in IMR, controlling for all other health determinants (p<0.01). Access to clean water and hospital beds per 1000 were negatively associated with IMR, while female illiteracy, fertility rates, and mean income were positively associated with IMR. Examination of interactions between Family Health Program coverage and diarrhoea deaths suggests the programme may reduce IMR at least partly through reductions in diarrhoea deaths. Interactions with deaths from acute respiratory infections were ambiguous. Conclusions: The Family Health Program is associated with reduced IMR, suggesting it is an important, although not unique, contributor to declining infant mortality in Brazil.

124;Objectives: To propose a regional synthetic indicator (ISR) to evaluate the health system performance in Brazilian regions based on a national database source available free of charge in a global network of computers. Methods: a cross-sectional study using secondary data, considered seven variables of five dimensions in the health system (population’s health conditions, health system coverage, financing, human resources and SUS production) analyzed from a survey of 438 Brazilian regions and adopted factor analysis and cluster models, conditioned by variables, such as: socioeconomic development, offering and service complexity and which resulted in a grouping of five strata. Results: mapping and scheduling based on ISR in health regions in Brazil and a detailed analysis of different indicators that compose them. The regions that showed better performance are in the Southeast, South and Midwest. Conclusions: This article sums efforts of other authors to extend the evaluation studies in health systems in a regional level. In addition, it is expected that the researches broaden their scope and implement the discussions about the process of regionalization in order to provide health policies, a universalized access and care comprehensiveness. © 2017, Instituto Materno Infantil Professor Fernando Figueira.

131;Modern developments in the state-of-the-art open-source activation functions for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have broadened the selection of benchmark activations for Deep Learning (DL)-aided classification. Nevertheless, achieving discrimination of non-linear input image data in CNN is still not straightforward and it is unclear how such novel activation functions can have translational applications with tangible impact. hyper-sinh, made freely available in TensorFlow and Keras, was demonstrated as a benchmark activation function on five (N=5) datasets in its ground-breaking paper. Measuring the value from deploying this activation in a specific application is pivotal to supply the required evidence of its performance on real-life supervised DL-based image classification tasks. In this study, a CNN was for the first time combined with hyper-sinh to aid early detection of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) from discriminating pathophysiological patterns extracted from spiral drawings. Thus, the hyper-sinh activation was deployed tomaximise the separability of the input features from spiral drawings via automated pattern recognition. We demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of hyper-sinh-CNN to aid early diagnosis of PD, evaluated against other gold standard activation functions, including the recent Quantum ReLU (QReLU) and the modified Quantum ReLU (m-QReLU) that solved the ‘dying ReLU’ problem for the first time in the literature of DL. Two (N=2) benchmark datasets from the database of the Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University in Brazil, scaled to be in 28 by 28 pixels as the MNIST benchmark data, were used to discriminate between input image patterns of 158 subjects (53 healthy controls and 105 patients with PD) from spirals drawn on graphics tablets. Overtraining was avoided via early stopping and the models were developed and tested in TensorFlow and Keras (Python 3.6). The supervised model (hyper-sinh-CNN) could detect early Parkinson’s Disease with 81% and 91% classification accuracy from the two datasets respectively (F1-scores: 73% and 91% correspondingly).

136;"BACKGROUND: Major disparities in complications and mortality after appendectomy between countries with different income levels have not been well characterized, as comparative studies at patient level between countries are scant. This study aimed to investigate variations in postoperative complications, mortality, and failure to rescue after appendectomy between a high-income country and a low-to-middle-income country. METHODS: Hospital discharges on adult patients who underwent appendectomy were extracted from administrative databases from Colombia and 2 states of the United States (Florida and New York). Outcomes included major postoperative complications, in-hospital mortality, and failure to rescue. Univariate analyses were conducted to compare outcomes between the 2 countries. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the independent effect of country on outcomes after adjustment for patient age, sex, comorbidity index, severity of appendicitis, and appendectomy route (laparoscopic/open). RESULTS: A total of 62,338 cases from Colombia and 57,987 from the United States were included in the analysis. Patients in Colombia were significantly younger and healthier but had a higher incidence of peritonitis. Use of laparoscopy was significantly lower in Colombia (5.9% vs 89.4%; P <.0001). After adjustment for covariates, multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that compared to the United States, Colombia had lower complication rates (2.8% vs 6.6%; odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.44; P <.0001) but higher mortality (0.44% vs 0.08%; OR, 8.92; 95% CI, 5.69-13.98; P <.0001) and failure to rescue (13.6% vs 1.0%; OR, 17.01; 95% CI, 10.66-27.16; P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite lower rates of postoperative complications, in-hospital mortality after appendectomy was higher in Colombia than in the United States. This difference may be explained by higher rates of failure to rescue in the low-to-middle-income country (ie, decreased ability of Colombian hospitals to rescue patients from complications). © 2022 International Anesthesia Research Society.";Failure to Rescue and Mortality Differences after Appendectomy in a Low-Middle-Income Country and the United States;Rosero E.B., Eslava-Schmalbach J., Garzon-Orjuela N., Buitrago G., Joshi G.P.;2023;Anesthesia and Analgesia;0;10.1213/ANE.0000000000006336;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159765323&doi=10.1213%2fANE.0000000000006336&partnerID=40&md5=d4b3f9dc5a70c6921493ba5e3a5bacec;"Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Management, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, United States; Health Equity Research Group, School of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia; Clinical Research Institute, School of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia";;"acute appendicitis; adult; aged; appendectomy; Article; Colombia; comorbidity; controlled study; failure to rescue (health care); female; Florida; high income country; hospital discharge; human; in-hospital mortality; laparoscopy; low income country; major clinical study; male; middle income country; mortality; mortality rate; New York; peritonitis; postoperative complication; sensitivity analysis; surgical mortality; United States; appendectomy; appendicitis; hospital; laparoscopy; length of stay; postoperative complication; retrospective study; treatment outcome; United States; Adult; Appendectomy; Appendicitis; Florida; Hospitals; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; United States";"acute appendicitis;adult;aged;appendectomy;Article;Colombia;comorbidity;controlled study;failure to rescue (health care);female;Florida;high income country;hospital discharge;human;in-hospital mortality;laparoscopy;low income country;major clinical study;male;middle income country;mortality;mortality rate;New York;peritonitis;postoperative complication;sensitivity analysis;surgical mortality;United States;appendicitis;hospital;length of stay;retrospective study;treatment outcome;Hospitals;Humans;Postoperative Complications;Retrospective Studies";"United States;Colombia";"Colombia: Databases of the Contributaroy Regime of the Social Security System in Health of Colombia; NY, FL - State Inpatient Databses and Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases";Tabular;Open;No;2 USA, 3 Colombia;yes
137;"This study aimed to assess the prevalence of non-use of health services in the last year by people with Chagas disease (CD) in an endemic area in Brazil and the contextual and individual factors associated with this non-use. This is a multilevel study that considered contextual and individual data. Contextual data were collected from official publicly accessible databases of the Brazilian government, at the municipal level. The individual data came from the first follow-up of a Brazilian cohort that assessed patients with CD in 21 municipali-ties in endemic area for the disease. The sample consisted of 1,160 individuals with CD. The dependent variable “use of health services in the last year” was categorized as yes vs. no. The analysis was performed using Poisson regression with robust variance. The prevalence of non-use of health services in the last year was 23.5% (IC95%: 21.1–25.9). The contextual factor “larger population” (PR: 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2–2.0) and individual factors related to the lower severity of the disease as a functional class without limitations (PR: 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2–2.1) and unaltered N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide levels (PR: 2.2; 95% CI = 1.3–3.6) increased the prevalence of non-use of the health service in the last year by people with CD. The results of this study showed that individual determinants are not isolated pro-tagonists of the non-use of health services in the last year by people with CD, which rein-forces the need for public policies that consider the contextual determinants of the use of health services by populations affected by the disease. © 2022 Damasceno et al.";Failure to use health services by people with Chagas disease: Multilevel analysis of endemic area in Brazil;Damasceno R.F., Sabino E.C., Ribeiro A.L.P., Ferreira A.M., de Oliveira-Da Silva L.C., Oliveira C.D.L., Cardoso C.S., Vieira T.M., Haikal D.S.A.;2022;PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases;0;10.1371/journal.pntd.0010785;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139380485&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pntd.0010785&partnerID=40&md5=104f047b250bba57a142a8f649e7f767;"Graduate Program in Health Sciences, State University of Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Montes Claros, Brazil; Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Department of Internal Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Federal University of São João del-Rey, Research Group in Epidemiology and New Technologies in Health–Centro Oeste Campus, Minas Gerais, Divinópolis, Brazil";;"amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; brain natriuretic peptide; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; Chagas disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; daily life activity; dependent variable; diabetes mellitus; electrocardiogram; endemic disease; female; follow up; health insurance; health service; human; hypertension; IC95; income; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multilevel analysis; physical activity; Poisson regression; prevalence; quality of life; self report; smoking; telehealth; Trypanosoma cruzi; vulnerability; Brazil; Chagas disease; cross-sectional study; health service; multilevel analysis; socioeconomics; Brazil; Chagas Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Services; Humans; Multilevel Analysis; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Socioeconomic Factors";"amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide;brain natriuretic peptide;adult;alcohol consumption;Article;Chagas disease;cohort analysis;controlled study;daily life activity;dependent variable;diabetes mellitus;electrocardiogram;endemic disease;female;follow up;health insurance;health service;human;hypertension;IC95;income;lifestyle;major clinical study;male;middle aged;multilevel analysis;physical activity;Poisson regression;prevalence;quality of life;self report;smoking;telehealth;Trypanosoma cruzi;vulnerability;Brazil;cross-sectional study;socioeconomics;Cross-Sectional Studies;Health Services;Humans;Natriuretic Peptide, Brain;Socioeconomic Factors";Brazil;"Atlas of Human Development in Brazil (Atlas de Desenvolvimento Humano no Brasil - AtlasBr); Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Saude - MS); Brazilian Institute of Geography and Stastictics - Cities (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica - Cidades - IBGE Cidades)";Tabular;Open;No;9 Brazil;yes
138;"Rationale and objective: The burden of breast cancer has increased worldwide. Breast cancer mortality has been increasing in Central and South America (CSA) in the last few decades. We describe the current burden of breast cancer in CSA and review the current status of disease control. Methods: We obtained regional-and national-level incidence data from 48 population-based cancer registries in 13 countries and cancer deaths from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries. We estimated world population age-standardized incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 person-years for 2003-2007 and the estimated annual percentage change to describe time trends. Results: In the most recent 5-year period, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay had the highest incidence rates (67.7-71.9) and Bolivia and El Salvador had the lowest (7.9-12.7). For most countries, mortality rates were <= 12.3, except in Uruguay, Argentina and Cuba (14.9-20.5). Age-specific rates increased after the age of 40-50 years and reached a maximum after age 65 years (mean age at diagnosis 56-62 years). Most countries have developed national screening guidelines; however, there is limited capacity for screening. Conclusion: The geographic variation of breast cancer rates may be explained by differences in the prevalence of reproductive patterns, lifestyle factors, early detection, and healthcare access. Extending early-detection programs is challenging because of inequalities in healthcare access and coverage, limited funding, and inadequate infrastructure, and thus it may not be feasible. Given the current status of breast cancer in CSA, data generated by population-based cancer registries is urgently needed for effective planning for cancer control.

141;Most countries are reopening or considering lifting the stringent prevention policies such as lockdowns, consequently, daily coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases (confirmed, recovered and deaths) are increasing significantly. As of July 25th, there are 16.5 million global cumulative confirmed cases, 9.4 million cumulative recovered cases and 0.65 million deaths. There is a tremendous necessity of supervising and estimating future COVID-19 cases to control the spread and help countries prepare their healthcare systems. In this study, time-series models - Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) are used to forecast the epidemiological trends of the COVID-19 pandemic for top-16 countries where 70%-80% of global cumulative cases are located. Initial combinations of the model parameters were selected using the auto-ARIMA model followed by finding the optimized model parameters based on the best fit between the predictions and test data. Analytical tools Auto-Correlation function (ACF), Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used to assess the reliability of the models. Evaluation metrics Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) were used as criteria for selecting the best model. A case study was presented where the statistical methodology was discussed in detail for model selection and the procedure for forecasting the COVID-19 cases of the USA. Best model parameters of ARIMA and SARIMA for each country are selected manually and the optimized parameters are then used to forecast the COVID-19 cases. Forecasted trends for confirmed and recovered cases showed an exponential rise for countries such as the United States, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Bangladesh, India, Mexico and Pakistan. Similarly, trends for cumulative deaths showed an exponential rise for countries Brazil, South Africa, Chile, Colombia, Bangladesh, India, Mexico, Iran, Peru, and Russia. SARIMA model predictions are more realistic than that of the ARIMA model predictions confirming the existence of seasonality in COVID-19 data. The results of this study not only shed light on the future trends of the COVID-19 outbreak in top-16 countries but also guide these countries to prepare their health care policies for the ongoing pandemic.

142;Background: Since June 2011, the Brazilian health system started providing asthma medications (beclomethasone and salbutamol), totally free of charge to patients with asthma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the provision of free asthma medications on hospital admissions for asthma in Brazil, using a national hospitalization database (DATASUS), comparing the incidence of hospital admissions before and after the free supply of these drugs. Methods: Admissions of patients with 1-49 years of age by the Brazilian public health system with the diagnosis of asthma were compared pre (2008-2010) and post (2012-2014) provision of free medicines (beclomethasone and salbutamol). The number of hospital admissions due to asthma and non-respiratory diseases, as well as the amount spent with asthma hospitalization, were obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian government open-access public health database system. Results: Admission rates for asthma significantly decreased from 90.09/100.000 (2008-2010) to 59.85/100.000 (2012-2014), when the period pre and post provision of free medicines were compared [OR 0.67 (CI 0.48-0.92)]. Non-respiratory admission rates remained stable, when both periods were also compared. Conclusion: Asthma hospitalization rates significantly decreased in the three-year period after the provision of free medicines to treat asthma. Our findings suggest that the provision of free medications for asthma may have a particular public health impact by its own in developing countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

145;Background Brazil is a middle-income country that aims to provide universal health coverage, but its surgical system's efficiency has rarely been analyzed. In an effort to strengthen surgical national systems, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery proposed bellwether procedures as quality indicators of surgical workforces. This study aims to evaluate regional inequalities in access to bellwether procedures and their associated mortality across the five Brazilian geographical regions.Methods Using DATASUS, Brazil's national healthcare database, data were collected on the total amount of performed bellwether procedures-cesarean section, laparotomy, and open fracture management-and their associated mortality, by geographical region. We evaluated the years 2018-2020, both in emergent and elective conditions. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA test and Tukey's multiple comparisons test.Results During this period, DATASUS registered 2,687,179 cesarean sections, 1,036,841 laparotomies, and 648,961 open fracture treatments. The access and associated mortality related to these procedures were homogeneous between the regions in elective care. There were significant geographical inequalities in access and associated mortality in emergency care (p < 0.05, 95% CI) for all bellwether procedures. The Southeast, the most economically developed region of the country, was the region with the lowest amount of bellwether procedures per 100,000 inhabitants.Conclusion Brazil's public surgical system is competent at promoting elective surgical care, but more effort is needed to fortify emergency care services. Public policies should encourage equity in the geographic allocation of the surgical workforce.;Geographical Inequalities in Access to Bellwether Procedures in Brazil;Faleiro, M.D., Fernandez, M.G., Santos, J.M., Menezes, C.E.G., Lima, J.V.S., Haddad, J.O.D., Viana, S.W., Alonso, N.;2022;WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY;0;10.1007/s00268-022-06855-9;;"[Faleiro, Matheus Daniel; Lima, Joao Vitor Sabadine] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; [Faleiro, Matheus Daniel; Fernandez, Miguel Godeiro; Santos, Jessica Moreira; Menezes, Catarina Ester Gomes; Lima, Joao Vitor Sabadine; Haddad, Julia Oliveira Dabien; Viana, Sofia Wagemaker] Int Student Surg Network Brazil, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; [Fernandez, Miguel Godeiro] Bahiana Sch Med & Publ Hlth EBMSP, Salvador, Brazil; [Santos, Jessica Moreira] Fac Ciencias Med Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; [Menezes, Catarina Ester Gomes] Univ Estado Bahia, Salvador, Brazil; [Haddad, Julia Oliveira Dabien] Univ Itauna, Itauna, Brazil; [Viana, Sofia Wagemaker] Kursk State Med Univ, Kursk, Russia; [Alonso, Nivaldo] Univ Sao Paulo, Div Plast Surg, Sao Paulo, Brazil";;MANAGEMENT;MANAGEMENT;"Brazil;Russian Federation";DATASUS;Tabular;Open;No;8 Brazil;yes
146;Objective To analyze the geographical variation in the provision of health services, namely in demand, patterns of utilization, and effectiveness in the Brazilian Health Regions in four different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, from February 2020 to March 2021. Methods Descriptive serial cross-sectional study based on secondary data on COVID-19 hospitalizations from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records collected by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and COVID-19 case notification data from Brasil.io, a repository of public data. Fifty-six epidemiological weeks were split into four periods. The following variables were considered for each Brazilian Health Region, per period: number of hospitalizations, hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants, hospitalizations per 100 new cases notified in the Health Region, percentage of hospitalizations with ICU use, percentages of hospitalizations with invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support, percentage of hospitalizations resulting in death and percentage of hospitalizations with ICU use resulting in death. Descriptive statistics of the variables were obtained across all 450 Health Regions in Brazil over the four defined pandemic periods. Maps were generated to capture the spatiotemporal variation and trends during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Results There was great variation in how COVID-19 hospitalizations grew and spread among Health Regions, with higher numbers between June and August 2020, and, especially, from mid-December 2020 to March 2021. The variation pattern in the proportion of ICU use in the hospitalizations across the Health Regions was broad, with no intensive care provision in large areas in the North, Northeast, and Midwest. The proportions of hospitalizations and hospitalizations with ICU use resulting in deaths were remarkably high, reaching medians of 34.0% and 62.0% across Health Regions, respectively.

152;The early dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak can be affected by various factors including the transmission mode of the disease and host-specific factors. While recent works have highlighted the presence of sub-exponential growth patterns during the early phase of epidemics, empirical studies examining the contribution of different factors to early epidemic growth dynamics are lacking. Here we aim to characterize and explain the early incidence growth patterns of local HIV/AIDS epidemics in Brazil as a function of socio-demographic factors. For this purpose, we accessed annual AIDS incidence series and state-level socio-demographic variables from publicly available databases. To characterize the early growth dynamics of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we employed the generalized-growth model to estimate with quantified uncertainty the scaling of growth parameter (p) which captures growth patterns ranging from constant incidence (p=0) to sub-exponential (0 < p < 1) and exponential growth dynamics (p=1) at three spatial scales: national, regional, and state levels. We evaluated the relationship between socio-demographic variables and epidemic growth patterns across 27 Brazilian states using mixed-effect regression analyses. We found wide variation in the early dynamics of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil, displaying sub-exponential growth patterns with the p parameter estimated substantially below 1.0. The mean p was estimated to be 0.81 at the national level, with a range of 0.72–0.85 at the regional level, and a range of 0.28–0.96 at the state level. Our findings support the notion that socio-demographic factors contribute to shaping the early growth dynamics of the epidemic at the local level. Gini index and socio-demographic index were negatively associated with the parameter p, whereas urbanicity was positively associated with p. The results could have theoretical significance in understanding differences in growth scaling across different sexually transmitted disease systems, and have public health implications to guide control. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;Growth scaling for the early dynamics of HIV/AIDS epidemics in Brazil and the influence of socio-demographic factors;Dinh L., Chowell G., Rothenberg R.;2018;Journal of Theoretical Biology;10;10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.12.030;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041481342&doi=10.1016%2fj.jtbi.2017.12.030&partnerID=40&md5=1bdc3f7897ce1c7c42eb4f4c245975a1;"Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, United States; Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States";"Brazil; Demographic factors; HIV/AIDS epidemic; Sub-exponential growth";"acquired immune deficiency syndrome; demographic survey; epidemiology; growth modeling; human immunodeficiency virus; public health; regression analysis; sexually transmitted disease; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Article; Brazil; Brazilian; controlled study; demography; generalized growth model; Gini index; human; incidence; mathematical model; mathematical parameters; mixed effect regression analysis; population density; priority journal; regression analysis; socio demographic index; urbanicity; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; algorithm; epidemic; factual database; geography; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; incidence; physiology; socioeconomics; theoretical model; transmission; virology; Brazil; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Algorithms; Brazil; Databases, Factual; Epidemics; Geography; HIV; HIV Infections; Humans; Incidence; Models, Theoretical; Socioeconomic Factors";"Brazil;Demographic factors;HIV/AIDS epidemic;Sub-exponential growth;acquired immune deficiency syndrome;demographic survey;epidemiology;growth modeling;human immunodeficiency virus;public health;regression analysis;sexually transmitted disease;Article;Brazilian;controlled study;demography;generalized growth model;Gini index;human;incidence;mathematical model;mathematical parameters;mixed effect regression analysis;population density;priority journal;socio demographic index;urbanicity;algorithm;epidemic;factual database;geography;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;physiology;socioeconomics;theoretical model;transmission;virology;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Algorithms;Databases, Factual;Epidemics;HIV;HIV Infections;Humans;Models, Theoretical;Socioeconomic Factors";United States;DATASUS, 1991 National Census data administered by IBGE and Global Burden of Disease Study led by Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation;Tabular;Open;No;3 USA;no
153;"Background: Hanseniasis is a public health concern in developing countries. Although a decrease in the number of new cases in Brazil has been reported, there is a prevalence above that recommended in some regions. Aims: Considering the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to accelerate towards a leprosy-free world from 2020, the aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological profile and leprosy trends in the city of Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the epidemiology and trends of hanseniasis between 2005 and 2018, monitoring socioeconomic and clinical epidemiological variables obtained from the Information System of Notifiable Diseases of Hanseniasis (SINAN) database. Results: A total of 422 cases of hanseniasis (284 male, 138 female) were included. The questionnaire of six patients was incomplete. The highest number of cases (89) was recorded in 2006 (11.7/10,000 inhabitants). The borderline clinical form was most common, with 45.4% of cases. Throughout the historical series, the rate of annual percentage change in the detection of new cases and cases with grade 2 disability showed a decreasing profile, at -13.9 [95% CI: -19.1, -8.2] and -13.1 [95% CI: -21.8, -5.5], respectively. The same rates were observed in patients below 15 years of age. Limitations: This study reflects the scenario in one reference center and data were obtained retrospectively. Conclusions: The incidence of hanseniasis in this reference center is declining gradually; however, the indicators show active disease transmission and late diagnosis.

157;HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission (HIV-1 MTCT), is an important cause of children mortality worldwide. Brazil has been traditionally praised by its HIV/Aids program, which provides free-of-charge care for people living with HIV-1. Using public epidemiology and demographic databases, we aimed at modeling HIV-1 MTCT prevalence in Brazil through the years (1994–2016) and elaborate a statistical model for forecasting, contributing to HIV-1 epidemiologic surveillance and healthcare decision-making. We downloaded sets of live births and mothers’ data alongside HIV-1 cases notification in children one year old or less. Through time series modeling, we estimated prevalence along the years in Brazil, and observed a remarkable decrease of HIV-1 MTCT between 1994 (10 cases per 100,000 live births) and 2016 (five cases per 100,000 live births), a reduction of 50%. Using our model, we elaborated a prognosis for each Brazilian state to help HIV-1 surveillance decision making, indicating which states are in theory in risk of experiencing a rise in HIV-1 MTCT prevalence. Ten states had good (37%), nine had mild (33%), and eight had poor prognostics (30%). Stratifying the prognostics by Brazilian region, we observed that the Northeast region had more states with poor prognosis, followed by North and Midwest, Southeast and South with one state of poor prognosis each. Brazil undoubtedly advanced in the fight against HIV-1 MTCT in the past two decades. We hope our model will help indicating where HIV-1 MTCT prevalence may rise in the future and support government decision makers regarding HIV-1 surveillance and prevention. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia;HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission in Brazil (1994–2016): a time series modeling;Campos Coelho A.V., Campos Coelho H.F., Arraes L.C., Crovella S.;2019;Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases;5;10.1016/j.bjid.2019.06.012;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070410264&doi=10.1016%2fj.bjid.2019.06.012&partnerID=40&md5=682a0f77e62a7d8edad2e4af168958da;"Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Departamento de Biologia Molecular, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Departamento de Genética, Recife, PE, Brazil; Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Departamento de Estatística, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Departamento de Medicina Tropical, Recife, PE, Brazil; Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira, Recife, PE, Brazil";"Biostatistics; Epidemiology; Forecasting; HIV-1; Perinatal transmission; Vertical transmission";"article; biostatistics; Brazil; child; clinical article; controlled study; decision making; female; forecasting; government; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; infant; live birth; mother; nonhuman; prevalence; prognosis; theoretical study; time series analysis; vertical transmission; adolescent; adult; Brazil; forecasting; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; middle aged; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; statistical model; time factor; vertical transmission; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Brazil; Child; Female; Forecasting; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Linear Models; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Prevalence; Time Factors; Young Adult";"Biostatistics;Epidemiology;Forecasting;HIV-1;Perinatal transmission;Vertical transmission;article;Brazil;child;clinical article;controlled study;decision making;female;government;human;Human immunodeficiency virus 1;infant;live birth;mother;nonhuman;prevalence;prognosis;theoretical study;time series analysis;adolescent;adult;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;middle aged;pregnancy;pregnancy complication;statistical model;time factor;young adult;HIV Infections;Humans;Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical;Linear Models;Pregnancy Complications, Infectious;Time Factors";Brazil;DATASUS;Tabular;Open;No;4 Brazil;yes
158;"Rationale and objective: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is largely curable owing to improvements in treatment since the 1960s; nevertheless, high mortality rates have been reported in Central and South America. We describe the current burden of HL in the Central and South American region. Methods: We obtained regional-and national-level incidence data from 48 population-based cancer registries in 13 countries, and national-level mortality data from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries. We estimated world population age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) and agestandardized mortality rates (ASMRs) per 100,000 person-years for 2003-2007 and present distributions by histological subtype. Results: HL incidence rates varied 7-fold in males and 11-fold in females (male-to-female ratio 1: 1-2.5: 1). The highest ASRs were seen Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica (males), Cuba (males) and Uruguay (females), whereas the lowest were in Bolivia and El Salvador. ASMRs varied by 4-fold in males and 6-fold in females (male-to-female ratio 1: 1-4.3: 1), with ASMRs < 0.7 for most countries, except Cuba (>= 1.0). In most countries, age-specific incidence rates of HL showed a bimodal pattern. Trends in HL in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Costa Rica remained stable in 1997-2008. Of all HL cases, 48% were unspecified as to histological subtype. Nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity were the most frequent histologies. Conclusion: The geographic variation in HL across the region may in part reflect differences in data quality and coverage, and differences in the adoption of modern therapies and healthcare access. Our results highlight the need for high-quality data and increased coverage in order to provide vital guidance for future cancer control activities.

166;Introduction: Pneumococcal disease is a major public health problem worldwide. From March to September of 2010, 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) was introduced in the Brazilian childhood National Immunization Program (NIP) in all 27 Brazilian states. The aim of the present study is to report national time-trends in incidence of hospital admissions for childhood pneumonia in Brazil before and after two years of introduction of this new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Methods: Analysis of hospitalization data of children aged 0-4 years in Brazilian public health system with an admission diagnosis of pneumonia from 2002 to 2012 was performed comparing pre (2002-2009) and post-vaccination periods (2011-2012). Hospital number of admission due to pneumonia and all non-respiratory diseases were obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian government open-access public health database system. Incidence of pneumonia hospitalization was compared to incidence of all non-respiratory admissions. Results: Admission rates for pneumonia decreased steadily from 2010 to 2012. In children aged less than four years, incidence of pneumonia hospitalizations decreased 12.65% when pre (2002-2009) and post-vaccination introduction periods (2011-2012) were compared and adjusted for seasonality and secular-trend (p < 0.001). On the other hand, non-respiratory admission rates remained stable comparing both periods (p = 0.39). Conclusion: Childhood pneumonia hospitalization rates were fluctuating prior to 2010 and decreased significantly in the two years after PHiD-CV introduction. Conversely, rate of non-respiratory admissions has shown no decrease. These data are an evidence of the effectiveness and public health impact of this new pneumococcal vaccine. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

168;Objective: To examine recent vaccination trends among Brazilian children during their first year of life, and the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on these trends. Methods: Monthly vaccination and birth data from the DATASUS (Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System) database of the Ministry of Health of Brazil were obtained from January 2017 to December 2020. Interrupted time series analysis was used to compare vaccination trends before and after March 2020, when isolation measures were first implemented in Brazil. Results: There was no strong evidence of a significant change in trends during the study period, or before and during the pandemic at national level. However, the mean number of vaccinations per child was 10.6, which is lower than the 13 doses expected under the immunization schedule. Conclusions: Although the pandemic did not appreciably impact on vaccinations, incomplete immunization among children aged <1 year in Brazil is cause for concern. A potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific antigens or regional and sociodemographic disparities in vaccinations cannot be ruled out without further research. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

170;"Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a worldwide challenge, and efforts to ""flatten the curve,"" including restrictions imposed by policymakers and medical societies, have forced a reduction in the number of procedures performed in the Brazilian Health Care System. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) from 2008 to 2020 in the SUS and to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the number of procedures and death rate of CABG performed in 2020 through the database DATASUS. Methods This study is based on publicly available material obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian Ministry of Health's data processing system, on numbers of surgical procedures and death rates. Only isolated CABG procedures were included in our study. We used the TabNet software from the DATASUS website to generate reports. Results We identified 281,760 CABG procedures performed from January 2008 to December 2020. The average number of procedures until the end of 2019 was of 22,104. During 2020 there was a 25% reduction CABG procedures, to 16,501. There was an increase in the national death rate caused by a statistical significant increase in death rates in Brazil's Southeast and Central-west regions. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global challenge for Brazil's health care system. During the year of 2020 there was a reduction in access to CABG related to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. There was also an increase in the national CABG death rate.";Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on coronary artery bypass graft surgery in Brazil: A nationwide perspective;Khalil, K.H., Sa, M.P.B.O., Vervoort, D., Roever, L., Pires, M.A.D., Lima, J.M.D., de Salles, F.B., Khalil, G.M., Gomes, P.F., Mejia, O.A.V., Okino, A.A., Lima, R.D.;2021;JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY;1;10.1111/jocs.15765;;"[Khalil, Kalil Hussein; de Andrade Pires, Marcos Alfredo; de Oliveira Lima, Jaqueline Maria; Khalil, Giovana Munhoz; Okino, Arnaldo Akio] Jardim Univ, Hosp Norte Paranaense, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Arapongas, Parana, Brazil; [Sa, Michel Pompeu B.

172;Background: Novel influenza surveillance systems that leverage Internet-based real-time data sources including Internet search frequencies, social-network information, and crowd-sourced flu surveillance tools have shown improved accuracy over the past few years in data-rich countries like the United States. These systems not only track flu activity accurately, but they also report flu estimates a week or more ahead of the publication of reports produced by healthcare-based systems, such as those implemented and managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Previous work has shown that the predictive capabilities of novel flu surveillance systems, like Google Flu Trends (GFT), in developing countries in Latin America have not yet delivered acceptable flu estimates. Objective: The aim of this study was to show that recent methodological improvements on the use of Internet search engine information to track diseases can lead to improved retrospective flu estimates in multiple countries in Latin America. Methods: A machine learning-based methodology that uses flu-related Internet search activity and historical information to monitor flu activity, named ARGO (AutoRegression with Google search), was extended to generate flu predictions for 8 Latin American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay) for the time period: January 2012 to December of 2016. These retrospective (out-of-sample) Influenza activity predictions were compared with historically observed flu suspected cases in each country, as reported by Flunet, an influenza surveillance database maintained by the World Health Organization. For a baseline comparison, retrospective (out-of-sample) flu estimates were produced for the same time period using autoregressive models that only leverage historical flu activity information. Results: Our results show that ARGO-like models' predictive power outperform autoregressive models in 6 out of 8 countries in the 2012-2016 time period. Moreover, ARGO significantly improves on historical flu estimates produced by the now discontinued GFT for the time period of 2012-2015, where GFT information is publicly available. Conclusions: We demonstrate here that a self-correcting machine learning method, leveraging Internet-based disease-related search activity and historical flu trends, has the potential to produce reliable and timely flu estimates in multiple Latin American countries. This methodology may prove helpful to local public health officials who design and implement interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of influenza outbreaks. Our methodology generally outperforms both the now-discontinued tool GFT, and autoregressive methodologies that exploit only historical flu activity to produce future disease estimates.;Improved Real-Time Influenza Surveillance: Using Internet Search Data in Eight Latin American Countries;Clemente, L., Lu, F., Santillana, M.;2019;JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE;14;10.2196/12214;;"[Clemente, Leonardo] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Monterrey, Mexico; [Clemente, Leonardo; Lu, Fred; Santillana, Mauricio] Boston Childrens Hosp, Computat Hlth Informat Program, 1 Autumn St, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Santillana, Mauricio] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02115 USA";"google flu trends; influenza monitoring; real-time disease surveillance; digital epidemiology; influenza; human; developing countries; machine learning";FLU;"google flu trends;influenza monitoring;real-time disease surveillance;digital epidemiology;influenza;human;developing countries;machine learning;FLU";"Mexico;United States";FluNet from WHO;Tabular;Open;No;1 Mexico, 2 USA;no
174;"Currently, it is estimated that 37.6 million people are living with the HIV/AIDS virus worldwide, placing HIV/AIDS among the ten leading causes of death, mostly among low- and lower-middle-income countries. Despite the effective intervention in the prevention and treatment, this reduction did not occur equally among populations, subpopulations and geographic regions. This difference in the occurrence of the disease is associated with the social determinants of health (SDH), which could affect the transmission and maintenance of HIV. With the recognition of the importance of SDH in HIV transmission, the development of mathematical models that incorporate these determinants could increase the accuracy and robustness of the modeling. This article aims to propose a theoretical and conceptual way of including SDH in the mathematical modeling of HIV/AIDS. The theoretical mathematical model with the Social Determinants of Health has been developed in stages. For the selection of SDH that were incorporated into the model, a narrative literature review was conducted. Secondly, we proposed an extended model in which the population (N) is divided into Susceptible (S), HIV-positive (I), Individual with AIDS (A) and individual under treatment (T). Each SDH had a different approach to embedding in the model. We performed a calibration and validation of the model. A total of 31 SDH were obtained in the review, divided into four groups: Individual Factors, Socioeconomic Factors, Social Participation, and Health Services. In the end, four determinants were selected for incorporation into the model: Education, Poverty, Use of Drugs and Alcohol abuse, and Condoms Use. the section ""Numerical simulation"" to simulate the influence of the poverty rate on the AIDS incidence and mortality rates. We used a Brazilian dataset of new AIDS cases and deaths, which is publicly available. We calibrated the model using a multiobjective genetic algorithm for the years 2003 to 2019. To forecast from 2020 to 2035, we assumed two lines of poverty rate representing (i) a scenario of increasing and (ii) a scenario of decreasing. To avoid overfitting, we fixed some parameters and estimated the remaining. The equations presented with the chosen SDH exemplify some approaches that we can adopt when thinking about modeling social effects on the occurrence of HIV. The model was able to capture the influence of the employment/poverty on the HIV/AIDS incidence and mortality rates, evidencing the importance of SDOH in the occurrence of diseases. The recognition of the importance of including the SDH in the modeling and studies on HIV/AIDS is evident, due to its complexity and multicausality. Models that do not take into account in their structure, will probably miss a great part of the real trends, especially in periods, as the current on, of economic crisis and strong socioeconomic changes.";Incorporating social determinants of health into the mathematical modeling of HIV/AIDS;de Oliveira, R.B., Rubio, F.A., Anderle, R., Sanchez, M., de Souza, L.E., Macinko, J., Dourado, I., Rasella, D.;2022;SCIENTIFIC REPORTS;0;10.1038/s41598-022-24459-0;;"[de Oliveira, Robson Bruniera; Rubio, Felipe Alves; Anderle, Rodrigo; de Souza, Luis Eugenio; Dourado, Ines; Rasella, Davide] Fed Univ Bahia UFBA, Inst Collect Hlth, Salvador, Brazil; [Sanchez, Mauro] Univ Brasilia, Dept Publ Hlth, Brasilia, Brazil; [Macinko, James] UCLA Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management & Community Hlth Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Rasella, Davide] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain";;"SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; DRUG-USE; HIV; IMPACT; PREVALENCE; STRATEGIES; AFRICA; PEOPLE";"SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS;DRUG-USE;HIV;IMPACT;PREVALENCE;STRATEGIES;AFRICA;PEOPLE";"Brazil;United States;Spain";Boletim Epidemiologico HIV/Aids 20221, Ministry of Health Brazil repository;Tabular;Open;No;7 Brazil, 1 USA;yes
175;Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the pathogen SARS-CoV-2, was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Recently, studies have discussed reports of patients infected with COVID-19 associated with vesicular manifestations of Herpes Zoster. The objective of this study was to compare the data from the Unified Health System (SUS) on the number of diagnoses of Herpes Zoster from March to August from 2017 to 2019, with the same period in 2020, in the five Brazilian regions (North, Northeast, Southeast, South, and Midwest). The data were extracted from the public database (DATASUS) of Brazil's Ministry of Health. The data showed an increase in the number of Herpes Zoster diagnoses over the years and the negative impact from the COVID-19 disease, revealing an average increase corresponding to an extra 10.7 cases per million inhabitants during the pandemic in all Brazilian Regions. Therefore, although the association between HZ and COVID-19 is not well established, we observed in this study an increase in HZ cases during the COVID -19 pandemic, which suggests a correlation between these diseases. ? 2021 The Authors.

176;"Objectives: Concerns about the increasing impact of severe COVID-19 in younger individuals in Brazil came after a recent synchronised country-wide wave of cases in Brazil. This communication analyses how hospitalisations due to COVID-19 changed in the age groups 18-49 years and >= 70 years. Study design: Longitudinal study based on secondary data. Methods: Data from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records (including COVID-19 notifications), were used in this study. Statistical control charts examined changes in the magnitude and variation of younger (18-49 years) and older (>= 70 years) adults who were hospitalised between 15th March 2020 and 19th June 2021. Results: During the few first weeks of the pandemic in Brazil, the number of COVID-19 hospitalisations increased in older adults but decreased in younger adults. Subsequently, hospitalisations reached statistical control zones in epidemiological weeks (EW) 19-48 of 2020 (EW 19-48/2020) and EW 03-05/2021 (18-49 y, mean = 26.1%; >= 70 y, mean = 32.8%). Between EW 49/2020 and EW 02/2021, the number of hospitalisations of younger adults dropped to levels below the lower control limit. In contrast, the number of hospitalisations of older adults surpassed the upper limit of the corresponding statistical control zones. However, from EW 06/2021, numbers of hospitalisations changed from statistical control zones, with hospitalisations of younger adults increasing and reaching 44.9% in EW 24/2021 and hospitalisations of older adults decreasing until EW 19/2021 (14.1%) and reaching 17.3% in EW 24/2021. Conclusions: An increasing number of COVID-19 hospitalisations were observed in younger adults from EW 06/2021. This could be a result of the successful vaccination programme in older adults, who were initially prioritised, and possibly an increased exposure to highly transmissible variants of COVID-19 in younger adults who had to go to work in the absence of social protection (i.e. government financial support). Potential consequences of COVID-19 hospitalisations in younger adults could include a reduced life expectancy of the population and an increased number of people unable to perform daily activities due to post-COVID-19 conditions.

179;"Dietary habits are determinants in the development of a range of conditions and age-related diseases. We explored the associations of sociodemographic, health-related indicators, and health behavioral factors on dietary guideline compliance in elderly Chileans. We used a cross-sectional design using the publicly available database from the last Chilean National Health Survey (2016-17). The sample of 1831 older adults (>= 60 y) from a national representative sample. The dependent variable was compliance with Food Guidelines (FG) (daily consumption of water, dairy, and fruits and vegetables; and weekly consumption of legumes and fish). The independent variables included sociodemographic, health-related, and behavioral factors. Over half (51.8%) of the sample was female and 85.7% belonged to the 60-79 age group. Satisfactory compliance to FG was observed in 3.9% of the sample. In the adjusted analysis, for those between 60 and 79 y, marital status was the only significant variable associated with FG noncompliance (PR: 1.34; 95%CI: 1.04-1.71).

184;"Introduction: This article aims at describing the National Health Survey (Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde — PNS) methodology of collecting laboratory exams data. Methodology: A subsample of 25% of the census tracts was selected, according to the stratification of the PNS sample, with a probability inversely proportional to the difficulty of collection. The collection of blood and urine was done in the households by a laboratory agent, among residents selected for individual interview. Due to the difficulties found in the field work, the sample did not reach the minimum expected number in some strata, and a post-stratification procedure was proposed for the data analysis. Results: The collection of biospecimens was performed in 8,952 individuals. Laboratory tests were: glycated hemoglobin; total cholesterol; LDL cholesterol; HDL cholesterol; serology for dengue; red blood cell count (erythrogram) and white series count (leukogram); high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies; creatinine. The excretion of potassium, salt and sodium and creatinine was estimated in the urine. The database of laboratory exams was weighed and made publicly available on the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation’s PNS website and can be accessed without prior authorization. Conclusion: The total subsample of laboratory exams is of great value, since it allowed us to establish national reference parameters adequate to sociodemographic and geographic characteristics of the Brazilian population, providing relevant and complementary information for the analysis of the health situation of Brazil. © 2019 Associação Brasileira de Saúde Coletiva.";Laboratory exams of the national health survey: Methodology of sampling, data collection and analysis [Exames laboratoriais da pesquisa nacional de saúde: Metodologia de amostragem, coleta e análise dos dados];Szwarcwald C.L., Malta D.C., de Souza Junior P.R.B., de Almeida W.D.S., Damacena G.N., Pereira C.A., Rosenfeld L.G.;2019;Revista Brasileira de Epidemiologia;21;10.1590/1980-549720190004.supl.2;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073071364&doi=10.1590%2f1980-549720190004.supl.2&partnerID=40&md5=f8be35c0ba3e2fabcd5f2f0057fdd4f8;"Institute for Communication and Scientific and Technological Information in Health, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; Department of Maternal Child Nursing and Public Health, School of Nursing, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; Hematology Center of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil";"Blood specimen collection; Clinical laboratory techniques; Health surveys; Sampling studies; Urine specimen collection";"cholesterol; adolescent; adult; blood; blood sampling; Brazil; dengue; erythrocyte count; factual database; female; health survey; high performance liquid chromatography; human; information processing; laboratory technique; leukocyte count; male; middle aged; procedures; urine sampling; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Blood Specimen Collection; Brazil; Cholesterol; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Data Collection; Databases, Factual; Dengue; Erythrocyte Count; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Male; Middle Aged; Urine Specimen Collection; Young Adult";"Blood specimen collection;Clinical laboratory techniques;Health surveys;Sampling studies;Urine specimen collection;cholesterol;adolescent;adult;blood;blood sampling;Brazil;dengue;erythrocyte count;factual database;female;health survey;high performance liquid chromatography;human;information processing;laboratory technique;leukocyte count;male;middle aged;procedures;urine sampling;young adult;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Data Collection;Databases, Factual;Humans";Brazil;"Laboratory exams of the National

187;"Objectives. To demonstrate the importance of country surveillance systems for leptospirosis and their use for preliminary epidemiological analysis, as well as to generate research questions for future, more comprehensive studies on the disease. Methods. In 2015, for the first time, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) included human cases of leptospirosis in its Regional Core Health Data Initiative, an open-access database that collects annual health indicators from the countries and territories of the Americas. This new information was used to analyze leptospirosis cases by country and sex and to calculate cumulative incidence rates. Maps were used to help present the results. To supplement that general review of leptospirosis in the Americas, more detailed descriptions of the epidemiological situation and the surveillance programs of four selected countries (Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, and Honduras) were provided. Results. In this first year of PAHO requesting leptospirosis data, of the 49 countries and territories in the Americas, 38 of them (77.6%) reported information. Among those 38, 28 of them (73.7%) reported the presence of human cases; the majority of instances of zero cases were in Caribbean territories. From those 28, a total of 10 702 human cases were recorded. The largest numbers of cases in Latin America were in Brazil (40.2%), Peru (23.6%), Colombia (8.8%), and Ecuador (7.2%). The cumulative incidence rate for Latin America was estimated to be 2.0 per 100 000 population. On average, 65.1% of cases were males. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that many countries in Latin America are making efforts to establish strong surveillance systems and programs for leptospirosis. The study also shows the importance of having leptospirosis surveillance systems as well as how the in formation generated can be used for evidence-based decision-making on leptospirosis.";Leptospirosis in Latin America: exploring the first set of regional data;Schneider, M.C., Leonel, D.G., Hamrick, P.N., de Caldas, E.P., Velasquez, R.T., Paez, F.A.M., Arrebato, J.C.G., Gerger, A., Pereira, M.M., Aldighieri, S.;2017;REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH;13;;;"[Schneider, Maria Cristina; Leonel, Deise Galan; Hamrick, Patricia Najera; Gerger, Andrea; Aldighieri, Sylvain] Pan Amer Hlth Org, Dept Communicable Dis & Hlth Anal, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [de Caldas, Eduardo Pacheco] Minist Saude, Secretaria Vigilancia Saude, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Teresa Velasquez, Reina] Secretaria Salud, Tegucigalpa, Honduras; [Mendigana Paez, Fernando Antonio] Minist Salud & Protecc Social, Subdirecc Enfermedades Transmisibies, Bogota, Colombia; [Gonzalez Arrebato, Jusayma Caridad] Minist Salud Publ, Programa Nacl Zoonosis, Havana, Cuba; [Pereira, Martha Maria] Org Mundial Saude Leptospirose, Ctr Colaborador, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil";"Leptospirosis; zoonoses; government programs; health surveillance system; Latin America";"SLUM COMMUNITIES; ONE HEALTH; EPIDEMIC; DISEASES; IMPACT; BRAZIL";"Leptospirosis;zoonoses;government programs;health surveillance system;Latin America;SLUM COMMUNITIES;ONE HEALTH;EPIDEMIC;DISEASES;IMPACT;BRAZIL";Brazil, Colombia;Pan American Health Organization.

189;Objective. To identify advantages and challenges of using household survey data to measure access barriers to health services in the Americas and to report findings from most recent surveys. Methods. Descriptive cross-sectional study using data retrieved from publicly available nationally representative household surveys carried out in 27 countries of the Americas. Values for indicators of access barriers for forgone care were generated using available datasets and reports from the countries. Results were disaggregated by wealth quintiles according to income or asset-based wealth levels. Results. Most surveys were similar in general approach and in the categories of their content. However, country-specific questionnaires varied by country, which hindered cross-country comparisons. On average, about one-Third of people experienced multiple barriers to forgone appropriate care. There was great variability between countries in the experience of these barriers, although disparities were relatively consistent across countries. People in the poorest wealth quintile were more likely to experience barriers related to acceptability issues, financial and geographic access, and availability of resources. Conclusions. The analysis indicates major inequalities by wealth status and uneven progress in multiple access barriers that hinder progress towards the goals of equity as part of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health in the Americas. Access barriers were multiple, which highlights the need for integrated and multisectoral approaches to tackle them. Given the variability between instruments across countries, future efforts are needed to standardize questionnaires and improve data quality and availability for regional monitoring of access barriers. © 2020 Pan American Health Organization.

196;This descriptive study sought to analyze the mental health status of 48 Northeastern municipalities in Brazil with quilombola communities and agrarian reform settlements in their territories, considering the living conditions, health service supply and the profile of morbidity and mortality in mental health. Gender, class and race aspects are articulated to understand the production of health inequities in these territories. By means of a quantitative analysis based on secondary data collected from different open databases, the research unveiled the intersection and combination of factors that influence the mental health status of municipalities with rural and forest populations: the precariousness of living and working conditions, insufficient support from psychosocial care services, and ethnic-racial and gender inequalities in psychiatric morbidity and mortality. © 2022, Associacao Universitaria de Pesquisa em Psicopatologia Fundamental.

206;"BackgroundNutrition is one of the main factors affecting the development and quality of life of a person. From a public health perspective, food security is an essential social determinant for promoting healthy nutrition. Food security embraces four dimensions: physical availability of food, economic and physical access to food, food utilization, and the sustainability of the dimensions above. Integrally addressing the four dimensions is vital. Surprisingly most of the works focused on a single dimension of food security: the physical availability of food. ObjectiveThe paper proposes a multi-dimensional dataset of open data and satellite images to characterize food security in the department of Cauca, Colombia. MethodsThe food security dataset integrates multiple open data sources; therefore, the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining methodology was used to guide the construction of the dataset. It includes sources such as population and agricultural census, nutrition surveys, and satellite images. ResultsAn open multidimensional dataset for the Department of Cauca with 926 attributes and 9 rows (each row representing a Municipality) from multiple sources in Colombia, is configured. Then, machine learning models were used to characterize food security and nutrition in the Cauca Department. As a result, The Food security index calculated for Cauca using a linear regression model (Mean Absolute Error of 0.391) is 57.444 in a range between 0 and 100, with 100 the best score. Also, an approach for extracting four features (Agriculture, Habitation, Road, Water) of satellite images were tested with the ResNet50 model trained from scratch, having the best performance with a macro-accuracy, macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-F1-score of 91.7, 86.2, 66.91, and 74.92%, respectively. ConclusionIt shows how the CRISP-DM methodology can be used to create an open public health data repository. Furthermore, this methodology could be generalized to other types of problems requiring the creation of a dataset. In addition, the use of satellite images presents an alternative for places where data collection is challenging. The model and methodology proposed based on open data become a low-cost and effective solution that could be used by decision-makers, especially in developing countries, to support food security planning.";Multi-Dimensional Dataset of Open Data and Satellite Images for Characterization of Food Security and Nutrition;Restrepo, D.S., Perez, L.E., Lopez, D.M., Vargas-Canas, R., Osorio-Valencia, J.S.;2022;FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION;3;10.3389/fnut.2021.796082;;"[Restrepo, David S.; Perez, Luis E.; Lopez, Diego M.] Univ Cauca, Telemat Dept, Telemat Engn Res Grp, Popayan, Colombia; [Vargas-Canas, Rubiel] Univ Cauca, Instrumentat & Control Res Grp, Dept Phys, Dynam Syst, Popayan, Colombia; [Osorio-Valencia, Juan Sebastian] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA USA";"data mining; food security; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; dataset";YIELD ESTIMATION;"data mining;food security;machine learning;remote sensing;satellite imagery;dataset;YIELD ESTIMATION";Colombia;Multidimensional Dataset Of Food Security And Nutrition In Cauca (https://data.mendeley.com/v1/datasets/wsss65c885/draft?a=da27eda0-9529-4ad8-9922-6ffe8de79756);Tabular and Images;Open;Yes;"Colombia;United States";yes
217;– Background – Abdominal wall hernia is one of the most common surgical pathologies. The advent of minimally invasive surgery raised questions about the best technique to be applied, considering the possibility of reducing postoperative pain, a lower rate of complications, and early return to usual activities. Objective – To evaluate the frequency of open and laparoscopic hernioplasties in Brazil from 2008 to 2018, analyzing the rates of urgent and elective surgeries, mortality, costs, and the impact of laparoscopic surgical training on the public health system. Methods – Nationwide data from 2008 to 2018 were obtained from the public health registry database (DATASUS) for a descriptive analysis of the selected data and parameters. Results – 2,671,347 hernioplasties were performed in the period, an average of 242,850 surgeries per year (99.4% open, 0.6% laparoscopic). The economically active population (aged 20-59) constituted the dominant group (54.5%). There was a significant reduction (P<0.01) in open surgeries, without a compensatory increase in laparoscopic procedures. 22.3% of surgeries were urgent, with a significant increase in mortality when compared to elective surgeries (P<0.01). The distribution of laparoscopic surgery varied widely, directly associated with the number of digestive surgeons. Conclusion – This study presents nationwide data on hernia repair surgeries in Brazil for the first time. Minimally invasive techniques represent a minor portion of hernioplasties. Urgent surgeries represent a high percentage when compared to other countries, with increased mortality. The data reinforce the need for improvement in the offer of services, specialized training, and equalization in the distribution of procedures in all regions. © 2020, IBEPEGE - Inst. Bras.

218;The openEHR specifications are designed to support implementation of flexible and interoperable Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. Despite the increasing number of solutions based on the openEHR specifications, it is difficult to find publicly available healthcare datasets in the openEHR format that can be used to test, compare and validate different data persistence mechanisms for openEHR. To foster research on openEHR servers, we present the openEHR Benchmark Dataset, ORBDA, a very large healthcare benchmark dataset encoded using the openEHR formalism. To construct ORBDA, we extracted and cleaned a de-identified dataset from the Brazilian National Healthcare System (SUS) containing hospitalisation and high complexity procedures information and formalised it using a set of openEHR archetypes and templates. Then, we implemented a tool to enrich the raw relational data and convert it into the openEHR model using the openEHR Java reference model library. The ORBDA dataset is available in composition, versioned composition and EHR openEHR representations in XML and JSON formats. In total, the dataset contains more than 150 million composition records. We describe the dataset and provide means to access it. Additionally, we demonstrate the usage of ORBDA for evaluating inserting throughput and query latency performances of some NoSQL database management systems. We believe that ORBDA is a valuable asset for assessing storage models for openEHR-based information systems during the software engineering process. It may also be a suitable component in future standardised benchmarking of available openEHR storage platforms.;ORBDA: An &ITopen&ITEHR benchmark dataset for performance assessment of electronic health record servers;Teodoro, D., Sundvall, E., Joao, M., Ruch, P., Freire, S.M.;2018;PLOS ONE;13;10.1371/journal.pone.0190028;;"[Teodoro, Douglas; Joao Junior, Mario, Jr.; Freire, Sergio Miranda] Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Dept Tecnol Informacao & Educ Saude, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Teodoro, Douglas; Ruch, Patrick] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, SIB Text Min, Geneva, Switzerland; [Teodoro, Douglas; Ruch, Patrick] HEG Geneva, HES SO, Dept Informat Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Sundvall, Erik] Linkoping Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Linkoping, Sweden; [Sundvall, Erik] Reg Ostergotland, Linkoping, Sweden";;"KNOWLEDGE GOVERNANCE; OPENEHR; INTEROPERABILITY; CARE";"KNOWLEDGE GOVERNANCE;OPENEHR;INTEROPERABILITY;CARE";"Brazil;Switzerland;Sweden";ORBDA;tabular;open;Yes;Brazil, Switzerland, Sweden;yes
225;"Background: Pregnancy in adolescents is a worldwide health problem and has been mostly common in poor populations. It is not clear if socioeconomic or biological factors are the main determinants of perinatal adverse outcomes in pregnant adolescents. Adolescents under 15 years old may present a high growth rate which may contribute to impair fetal growth. Our aim is to compare perinatal characteristics among early (aged 10 to 14 years) and late (aged 15 to 19 years) pregnant adolescents. Methods. A cross-sectional study was performed using data from Pernambuco State 2009, obtained from DATASUS/SISNAC, a Brazilian Government, open-access public health database. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between early (aged 10-14 years) and late (aged 15-19 years) pregnant adolescents. Family income was compared between early and late pregnant adolescents using a sample of 412 subjects evaluated at Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP) during 2011. Statistical comparisons were made using the chi-square test was used with a significant level of 0.05; bivariate and multivariate analysis were performed. This project was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board. Results: Data from 31,209 pregnant adolescents were analyzed. 29,733 (95.2%) were aged 15 to 19 years and 1,476 (4.7%) were aged 10 to 14 years. There were significant differences with respect to marital status, education level and number of prenatal visits of mothers aged 10 to 14 years compared to 15 to 19 years. Of importance, early adolescents had a greater rate of neonates born premature and with low birth weight. Prematurity and low birth weight remained statistically significant after multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Early aged adolescents may have an increased risk of prematurity and low birth weight. These findings highlight the potential role of biological factors in newborn outcomes in pregnant adolescents. © 2012 Alves et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";Perinatal characteristics among early (10-14 years old) and late (15-19 years old) pregnant adolescents;Alves J.G.B., Cisneiros R.M.R., Dutra L.P.F., Pinto R.A.;2012;BMC Research Notes;23;10.1186/1756-0500-5-531;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866538161&doi=10.1186%2f1756-0500-5-531&partnerID=40&md5=e6ef450cabfe550e1f4930a32d440686;"Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP), Rua dos Coelhos 300, Boa Vista, Recife PE, 50070-550, Brazil; Universidade Do Vale Do São Francisco (UNIVASF), Campos Universitário, Av.

227;The COVID-19 pandemic recently challenges worldwide health system. Many countries have been establishing several rules in order to fight against the expected exponentially growth of affected people. After some weeks hospital bed occupancy started to grow because of infected people and this demand can potentially overlap hospital bed capacity. In this scenario, doctors would have to decide who should be treated and patients without adequate treatment can increase number of deaths. Thus, in order to avoid that patient demand overlap hospital bed capacity, this research propose a forecast and simulation approach in order to provide the number of intensive care beds and health care professionals that could be available in a short-term of 21 days ahead taking into account 3 patient demand scenarios.

234;Background Knowledge regarding the modifiable risk factors of dementia is fundamental to guide public health policy. We aimed to estimate the population attributable fraction of modifiable risk factors of dementia among adults from a nationwide epidemiological study. Methods We used the public database of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) to calculate the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) for ten risk factors, including education level, hearing loss, hypertension, alcohol consumption, obesity, active smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, and diabetes. PAF was estimated for this sample after accounting for the communality of each risk factor. Findings The ten preventable risk factors for dementia accounted for 50 center dot 5% of the Population Attributable Fraction in Brazil. Hearing loss (14 center dot 2%), physical inactivity (11 center dot 2%), and hypertension (10 center dot 4%) accounted for the highest PAF among all the risk factors. Considerable variation in the relative contribution of the different risk factors was found in different regions. Interpretation This study might provide an opportunity to change the impact of dementia in Brazil. By targeting modifiable risk factors of dementia, the health of individuals in Brazil might be considerably improved. Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

236;Following the creation of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS), the Brazilian Health Informatics Department (DATASUS) was established in 1991, aimed at organizing information systems and databases in health. Online data access and viewing is free and open, using tables and graphs of aggregate data and access to raw data. However, the current form of data access does not fully meet the demands by health system administrators and other users for a flexible, user-friendly tool that allows dealing with various relevant health issues in the knowledge search and decision-making. We propose an ancillary system capable of generating monthly summary reports that are easy to access and understand, with an emphasis on viewing information through graphs and maps. © 2017, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

241;Background: From 2006 to 2017, the Brazilian federal government provided free of charge traditional insulins for diabetes treatment. This involved public tendering by the Department of Health Logistics of the Ministry of Health (DLOG-MOH) and the reimbursement after direct contracting for supply with commercial private retailers (Brazilian Popular Pharmacy Program — PFPB). Objective: We aim to describe the budget of the Brazilian federal government committed to for the acquisition of insulin, as well as corresponding prices and treatment availability from 2009 to 2017. Methods: Insulin volume and expenditure data were obtained in official administrative databases and in the Electronic System of the Information Service to Citizens. Data were analyzed according to the total provision by the federal government, DLOG-MOH and PFPB. Moreover, data were presented according to insulin type. Volumes were calculated in number of defined daily doses (DDD)/1,000 inhabitants/day. Results: Budgetary commitments due to insulin over nine years amounted to U$1,027 billion in 2017, with an approximate average of U$114.1 million per year. DLOG-MOH was the main insulin provider, despite the increase in PFPB provision along period. DLOG-MOH and PFBP together provided an average of 6.08 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day for nine years. Average prices in PFPB were higher than those in the DLOG series, with a downward trend over the years, narrowing to 2.7 times in 2017, when compared to 2009. Conclusions: Brazil evidenced a moderately sustainable and effective, albeit imperfect, policy for public provision of traditional insulins in the period preceding mandatory free supply of insulin analogues. Future studies must address treatment availability and financial sustainability in the new scenario. © 2020, Assocaicao Brasileira de Pos, Gradacao em Saude Coletiva.

246;Introduction: Antipsychotics are widely prescribed for patients with schizophrenia. The Brazilian public health system provides these patients free of charge to patients and it is pertinent to evaluate their benefits. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of olanzapine and risperidone in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in the real-world and assessing risk factors for their discontinuation through a national non-concurrent cohort with 16 years of follow-up. Methods: Three SUS administrative databases were integrated by deterministic-probabilistic linkage. After patients were matched (1:1) for psychiatric hospitalization, year of receiving the antipsychotic, sex, and age, considering either olanzapine or risperidone at study entry. Kaplan-Meier was used to estimate the cumulative probabilities of discontinuation of treatment and associated factors were identified. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: 3416 pairs of patients were included. Olanzapine had a longer time until discontinuation of treatment (p = 0.021), and risperidone had a higher risk of discontinuation (p = 0.021). Among patients persistent for at least 24 months, there was no statistically significant difference. Conclusion: Olanzapine demonstrated superior real-world effectiveness over risperidone, in terms of survival and psychiatric hospitalization. This superiority was not sustained in all analyses. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;"Real-world effectiveness of olanzapine and risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia in Brazil over a 16-year follow-up period; findings and implications";Barbosa W.B., Gomes R.M., Godman B., Acurcio F.D.A., Guerra Junior A.A.;2021;Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology;5;10.1080/17512433.2021.1865799;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098648604&doi=10.1080%2f17512433.2021.1865799&partnerID=40&md5=fe57749e9d267973f1c599fcd4659573;"Department of Social Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; SUS Collaborating Centre-Technology Assessment and Excellence in Health (CCATES/UFMG), Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; School of Pharmacy, Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, Garankuwa, South Africa";"Antipsychotics; Brazil; databases; olanzapine; real-world effectiveness; risperidone; schizophrenia";"atypical antipsychotic agent; clozapine; olanzapine; quetiapine; risperidone; ziprasidone; neuroleptic agent; olanzapine; risperidone; adult; aged; Article; Brazil; catatonic schizophrenia; cohort analysis; data base; drug efficacy; drug withdrawal; female; follow up; geographic origin; groups by age; hebephrenia; hospitalization; human; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; male; mental hospital; multivariate analysis; paranoid schizophrenia; postschizophrenic depression; prescription; psychopharmacotherapy; residual schizophrenia; risk factor; schizophrenia; simple schizophrenia; survival; treatment withdrawal; undifferentiated schizophrenia; univariate analysis; adolescent; comparative study; factual database; middle aged; public health; schizophrenia; time factor; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antipsychotic Agents; Brazil; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Olanzapine; Risk Factors; Risperidone; Schizophrenia; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult";"Antipsychotics;Brazil;databases;olanzapine;real-world effectiveness;risperidone;schizophrenia;atypical antipsychotic agent;clozapine;quetiapine;ziprasidone;neuroleptic agent;adult;aged;Article;catatonic schizophrenia;cohort analysis;data base;drug efficacy;drug withdrawal;female;follow up;geographic origin;groups by age;hebephrenia;hospitalization;human;intention to treat analysis;major clinical study;male;mental hospital;multivariate analysis;paranoid schizophrenia;postschizophrenic depression;prescription;psychopharmacotherapy;residual schizophrenia;risk factor;simple schizophrenia;survival;treatment withdrawal;undifferentiated schizophrenia;univariate analysis;adolescent;comparative study;factual database;middle aged;public health;time factor;treatment outcome;young adult;Antipsychotic Agents;Cohort Studies;Databases, Factual;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;National Health Programs;Risk Factors;Time Factors";Brazil;SIH/SUS, SIA/SUS, SIM;tabular;open;No;Brazil, UK, Sweden, South Africa;yes
248;Background Leprosy is an infectious disease that mostly affects underserved populations. Although it has been largely eliminated, still about 200'000 new patients are diagnosed annually. In the absence of a diagnostic test, clinical diagnosis is often delayed, potentially leading to irreversible neurological damage and its resulting stigma, as well as continued transmission. Accelerating diagnosis could significantly contribute to advancing global leprosy elimination. Digital and Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven technology has shown potential to augment health workers abilities in making faster and more accurate diagnosis, especially when using images such as in the fields of dermatology or ophthalmology. That made us start the quest for an AI-driven diagnosis assistant for leprosy, based on skin images. Methods Here we describe the accuracy of an AI-enabled image-based diagnosis assistant for leprosy, called AI4Leprosy, based on a combination of skin images and clinical data, collected following a standardized process. In a Brazilian leprosy national referral center, 222 patients with leprosy or other dermatological conditions were included, and the 1229 collected skin images and 585 sets of metadata are stored in an open-source dataset for other researchers to exploit. Findings We used this dataset to test whether a CNN-based AI algorithm could contribute to leprosy diagnosis and employed three AI models, testing images and metadata both independently and in combination. AI modeling indicated that the most important clinical signs are thermal sensitivity loss, nodules and papules, feet paresthesia, number of lesions and gender, but also scaling surface and pruritus that were negatively associated with leprosy. Using elastic-net logistic regression provided a high classification accuracy (90%) and an area under curve (AUC) of 96.46% for leprosy diagnosis. Interpretation Future validation of these models is underway, gathering larger datasets from populations of different skin types and collecting images with smartphone cameras to mimic real world settings. We hope that the results of our research will lead to clinical solutions that help accelerate global leprosy elimination. Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

255;"Objectives: Peru has had the highest death toll from the pandemic worldwide; however, it is not clear what the effects of the different variants on these outcomes are. The study aimed to evaluate the risk of death, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates of COVID-19 according to the SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in Peru from March 2020-February 2022. Methods: Retrospective study using open-access databases were published by the Peruvian Ministry of Health. Databases of genomic sequencing, death, COVID-19 cases, hospitalization and ICU, and vaccination were used. Crude and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regressions with clustered variances were modeled to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of outcomes by variant. Results: Lambda variant had the highest risk of death (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.37-2.68), whereas the Delta variant had the lowest risk (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31-0.82). Mu variant had the highest risk of hospitalization (HR: 2.39, 95% CI 1.56-3.67), Omicron the lowest (HR 0.45, 95%CI 0.23-0.90), and Gamma had the highest ICU admission rate (HR 1.95, 95%CI 1.40-2.71).

260;"Background Indigenous peoples are vulnerable to pandemics, including to the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, since it causes high mortality and specially, the loss of elderly Indigenous individuals. Methods The epidemiological data of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV-2 infection or other etiologic agents (OEA) among Brazilian Indigenous peoples during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from a Brazilian Ministry of Health open-access database to perform an observational study. Considering only Indigenous individuals diagnosed with SARS by COVID-19, the epidemiology data were also evaluated as risk of death. The type of sample collection for virus screening, demographic profile, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical evolution were evaluated. The primary outcome was considered the death in the Brazilian Indigenous individuals and the secondary outcome, the characteristics of Brazilian Indigenous infected by SARS-CoV-2 or OEA, as the need for intensive care unit admission or the need for mechanical ventilation support. The statistical analysis was done using Logistic Regression Model. Alpha of 0.05. Findings A total of 3,122 cases of Indigenous individuals with SARS in Brazil were reported during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these, 1,994 were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 730/1,816 (40.2%) of them died. The death rate among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 was three-fold increased when compared to the group of individuals with OEA. Several symptoms (myalgia, loss of smell, and sore throat) and comorbidities (cardiopathy, systemic arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) were more prevalent in the COVID-19 group when compared to Indigenous individuals with OEA. Similar profile was observed considering the risk of death among the Indigenous individuals with COVID-19 who presented several symptoms (oxygen saturation < 95%, dyspnea, and respiratory distress) and comorbidities (renal disorders, cardiopathy, and diabetes mellitus). The multivariate analysis was significant in differentiating between the COVID-19-positive and non-COVID-19 patients [X-2 ((7))=65.187; P-value< 0.001]. Among the patients' features, the following contributed in relation to the diagnosis of COVID-19: age [>= 43 years-old [y.o.]; OR=1.984 (95%CI=1.480-2.658)]; loss of smell [OR=2.373 (95%CI=1.461-3.854)]; presence of previous respiratory disorders [OR=0.487; 95%CI=0.287-0.824)]; and fever [OR=1.445 (95%CI=1.082-1.929)]. Also, the multivariate analysis was able to predict the risk of death [X-2 ((9))=293.694; P-value< 0.001]. Among the patients' features, the following contributed in relation to the risk of death: male gender [OR=1.507 (95%CI=1.010-2.250)]; age [>= 60 y.o.; OR=3.377 (95%CI=2.292-4.974)]; the need for ventilatory support [invasive mechanical ventilation; OR=24.050 (95%CI=12.584-45.962) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation; OR=2.249 (95%CI=1.378-3.671)]; dyspnea [OR=2.053 (95%CI=1.196-3.522)]; oxygen saturation <95% [OR=1.691 (95%CI=1.050-2.723)]; myalgia [OR=0.423 (95%CI=0.191-0.937)]; and the presence of kidney disorders [OR=3.135 (95%CI=1.144-8.539)]. Interpretation The Brazilian Indigenous peoples are in a vulnerable situation during the COVID-19 pandemic and presented an increased risk of death due to COVID-19. Several factors were associated with enhanced risk of death, as male sex, older age (>= 60 y.o.), and need for ventilatory support; also, other factors might help to differentiate SARS by COVID-19 or by OEA, as older age (>= 43 y.o.), loss of smell, and fever.

262;Objective: To evaluate factors related to liver graft survival with a focus on immunosuppressive schemes based on calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine). Methodology: This study was carried out through an open cohort constructed by deterministic and probabilistic matching through three databases of the SUS with assessment of liver graft survival from 2000 to 2015 in Brazil. From this first cohort, a second cohort was constructed by pairing 1: 1 to more precisely assess the effect of the immunosuppressive scheme on graft survival. The Kaplan-Meier method and was used to estimate the probability of survival. Cox’s model of proportional risks was used to assess factors related to graft loss. Result: We found 12,687 patients in the Full cohort and 470 patients in the Matched cohort. The overall graft survival rates at 1, 5, 10, and 16 years were 72.6, 63.3, 52.8, and 45.3%, respectively. Patients younger had a longer graft survival than older ones. In the Full cohort, male patients had a higher survival rate than female ones. Therapeutic schemes based on tacrolimus were more prevalent and had a better survival rate when compared to schemes that used cyclosporine. Tacrolimus without association with antiproliferative agents or rapamycin inhibitors was the therapeutic scheme associated with greater survival rate in both cohorts (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.72–0.91), (HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.30–0.85). In addition, white-skinned patients had longer survival rate in both cohorts (HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.50–0.61 and HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.34–0.75). On the other hand, patients who a greater time ratio without using an immunosuppressant had lower graft survival rate (HR = 6.46, 95% CI = 5.05–8.27 and HR = 6.57, 95% CI = 2.66–16.22). Conclusion: This 16-year cohort showed that the older age and the greater time ratio without using an immunosuppressant are risk factors for liver graft loss. White-skinned patients and tacrolimus-based regimens, especially tacrolimus without other immunosuppressants, are factors of better prognosis to the graft. © Copyright © 2020 Nascimento, Gomes, Alvares-Teodoro, Ribeiro, Cherchiglia, Simão-Filho, Acurcio, Sarmento, Gargano and Guerra.;Sixteen-Year Cohort of Liver Transplantation in the National Health System in Brazil: Analysis of Immunosuppression Maintenance Therapies;Nascimento G.F., Gomes R.M., Alvares-Teodoro J., Ribeiro N.G., Jr., Cherchiglia M.L., Simao-Filho C., Acurcio F.A., Sarmento T.T.R., Gargano L.P., Guerra A.A., Junior;2020;Frontiers in Pharmacology;1;10.3389/fphar.2020.572043;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093833037&doi=10.3389%2ffphar.2020.572043&partnerID=40&md5=004fb73df4d4b95a5f82f1f52c3e23ad;"Department of Social Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; SUS Collaborating Centre–Technology Assessment Excellence in Health, College of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, College of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Department of Surgery, College of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil";"graft survival; calcineurin inhibitor; cyclosporine; immunosuppression; liver transplantation; National Health Service; survival analysis; tacrolimus";"cyclosporine; rapamycin; tacrolimus; adult; age; aged; Article; Brazil; cohort analysis; female; follow up; graft failure; graft survival; human; immunosuppressive treatment; liver transplantation; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; open study; overall survival; prognosis; risk factor; survival rate; trend study";"graft survival;calcineurin inhibitor;cyclosporine;immunosuppression;liver transplantation;National Health Service;survival analysis;tacrolimus;rapamycin;adult;age;aged;Article;Brazil;cohort analysis;female;follow up;graft failure;human;immunosuppressive treatment;maintenance therapy;major clinical study;male;open study;overall survival;prognosis;risk factor;survival rate;trend study";Brazil;SIH/SUS, SIA/SUS, SIM;tabular;open;No;Brazil;yes
276;"Background: Vena cava filter implantation is considered a simple procedure, which can lead to overuse and over-indication. It is nevertheless associated with short and long-term complications. Objectives: The goals of this study were to evaluate rates of vena cava filter implantation conducted by Brazil’s Unified Public Health System, analyzing in-hospital mortality and migration of patients from other cities seeking medical attention in São Paulo. Methods: This study analyzed all vena cava filter procedures conducted from 2008 to 2018 in the city of São Paulo and registered on the public database using a big data system to conduct web scraping of publicly available databases. Results: A total of 1324 vena cava filter implantations were analyzed. 60.5% of the patients were female; 61.7% were under 65 years old; 34.07% had registered addresses in other cities or states; and there was a 7.4% in-hospital mortality rate. Conclusions: We observed an increase in the rates of use of vena cava filters up to 2010 and a decrease in rates from that year onwards, which coincides with the year that the Food and Drug Administration published a recommendation to better evaluate vena cava filter indications. © 2022 The authors.";Temporal trends in vena cava filter implantation in public health system inpatients: an 11-year analysis of the largest city in Brazil [Tendência temporal do implante de filtro de veia cava em pacientes internados no SUS em São Paulo: análise de 11 anos da maior cidade do Brasil];Leiderman D.B.D., Fiorelli M., Teivelis M.P., Stabellini N., Amaro Junior E., Wolosker N.;2022;Jornal Vascular Brasileiro;0;10.1590/1677-5449.20210186;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129513573&doi=10.1590%2f1677-5449.20210186&partnerID=40&md5=479295f1d2b730a5cd634beeb070c448;"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein – HIAE, SP, São Paulo, Brazil; Universidade de São Paulo – USP, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital de Clínicas, SP, São Paulo, Brazil; Faculdade Israelita de Ciências, Médicas Albert Einstein – FICMAE, SP, São Paulo, Brazil; Universidade de São Paulo – USP, SP, São Paulo, Brazil";"epidemiology; inferior vena cava filter; mortality rate; public health system; pulmonary embolism; thrombosis";"aged; aging; Article; big data; demographics; female; help seeking behavior; human; in-hospital mortality; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; public health service; Sao Paulo (state); sex ratio";"epidemiology;inferior vena cava filter;mortality rate;public health system;pulmonary embolism;thrombosis;aged;aging;Article;big data;demographics;female;help seeking behavior;human;in-hospital mortality;major clinical study;male;public health service;Sao Paulo (state);sex ratio";Brazil;DATASUS;tabular;open;No;Brazil;yes
286;Background: The COVID 19 epidemic submerged many health systems in the Amazon. The objective of the present study was to focus on the epidemic curves of the COVID 19 epidemic in different centers, and to look at testing and mortality data. Methods: Publicly available datasets were used. The log10 of the daily cumulated number of cases starting from the day the territory reached 100 cumulated cases was plotted to compare the magnitude, shape and slope of the different curves. The maximum daily testing efforts were plotted for each territory in relation to the maximum daily number of diagnoses. The case fatality rate was computed by dividing the number of COVID 19 deaths by the number of confirmed cases. Results: In the Amazonian regions in general the speed of growth was generally lower than in Europe or the USA, or Southern Brazil. Whereas, countries like South Korea or New Zealand “broke” the curve relatively rapidly the log linear trajectory seemed much longer with signs of a decline in growth rate as of early July 2020. After a very slow start, French Guiana had the lowest slope when compared to other Amazonian territories with significant epidemics. The Amazonian states of Roraima, Amazonas, Parà, and Amapà had among the highest number of cases and deaths per million inhabitants in the world. French Guiana had significantly fewer deaths relative to its number of confirmed cases than other Amazonian territories. French Guiana had a late epidemic surge with intense testing scale-up often exceeding 4,000 persons tested daily per million inhabitants. Brazil was an outlier with low daily testing levels in relation to the number of daily diagnoses. Conclusions: There were marked heterogeneities mortality rates suggesting that socioeconomic, political factors, and perhaps ethnic vulnerability led to striking outcome differences in this Amazonian context. © Copyright © 2021 Nacher, Rousseau, Succo, Andrieu, Gaillet, Michaud, Servas, Douine, Schaub, Adenis, Demar, Abboud, Epelboin and Djossou.;The Epidemiology of COVID 19 in the Amazon and the Guianas: Similarities, Differences, and International Comparisons;Nacher M., Rousseau C., Succo T., Andrieu A., Gaillet M., Michaud C., Servas V., Douine M., Schaub R., Adenis A., Demar M., Abboud P., Epelboin L., Djossou F.;2021;Frontiers in Public Health;8;10.3389/fpubh.2021.586299;https://ourworldindata.org/;"Centre d'Investigation Clinique Antilles Guyane, INSERM 1424, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Département Formation Recherche (DFR) Santé, Université de Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana; Santé Publique France, Cayenne, French Guiana; Centres Délocalisés de Prévention et de Soins, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana; Unité Mixte de Recherche Tropical Biome et Immuno-Pathologie (UMR TBIP), Université de Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana; Service des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana";"Amazon; COVID 19; epidemiology; Guiana shield; mortality; testing; vulnerable populations";"Brazil; cause of death; comparative study; epidemic; epidemiology; Europe; French Guiana; human; international cooperation; mortality; North America; Brazil; Cause of Death; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemics; Europe; French Guiana; Humans; Internationality; North America; SARS-CoV-2";"Amazon;COVID 19;epidemiology;Guiana shield;mortality;testing;vulnerable populations;Brazil;cause of death;comparative study;epidemic;Europe;French Guiana;human;international cooperation;North America;COVID-19;Disease Outbreaks;Epidemics;Humans;Internationality;SARS-CoV-2";Brazil, Colombia, bolivia, ecuador, frech guiana, guyana, peru, venezuela;Our world in data;Tabular - covid;open;No;French guiana;yes
292;Objectives: The overload of health services because of the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the population's access to treatment and prevention of other diseases. This study aimed to identify whether there was a change in the trend of breast biopsies and their direct costs during the COVID-19 pandemic in a developing country's public and universal healthcare system.Methods: This was an ecological time series study of mammograms and breast biopsies in women aged 30 years or older from an open-access data set of the Public Health System of Brazil from 2017 to July 2021.Results: In 2020, there was a reduction of-40.9% in mammograms and-7.9% in breast biopsies compared with the pre-pandemic period. From 2017 to 2020, there was an increase in the breast biopsies ratio per mammogram (1.37%-2.55%), the percentage of Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) IV and V mammograms (0.79%-1.14%), and the annual direct cost of breast biopsies (Brazilian Real 3 477410.00 to Brazilian Real 7 334 910.00). In the time series, the negative impact of the pandemic was lower on BI-RADS IV to V mammograms than on BI-RADS 0 to III. There was an association between the trend of breast biopsies and BI-RADS IV to V mammography.Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic harmed the increasing trend of breast biopsies, their total direct costs, BI-RADS 0 to III and IV to V mammograms, observed in the prepandemic period. Furthermore, there was a tendency to screen women at a higher risk for breast cancer during the pandemic.;The Negative Impact of the New Coronavirus Pandemic on the Trend of Breast Biopsies and Their Direct Costs: Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Hyeda, A., da Costa, E.S.M., Kowalski, S.C.;2023;VALUE IN HEALTH REGIONAL ISSUES;0;10.1016/j.vhri.2023.01.004;;"[Hyeda, Adriano] Univ Fed Parana, Postgrad Program Internal Med & Hlth Sci, Curitiba, Brazil; [da Costa, Elide Sbardellotto Mariano] Univ Fed Parana, Publ Hlth Dept, Curitiba, Brazil; [Kowalski, Sergio Candido] Univ Fed Parana, Med Clin Dept, Curitiba, Brazil; [Hyeda, Adriano] Postgrad Program Internal Med & Hlth Sci, Rua Gen Carneiro 181, Cent Bldg 11th Floor, BR-80060900 Curitiba, PR, Brazil";"biopsy; breast cancer; COVID-19; public health administration";"CANCER; REGRESSION; MORTALITY";"biopsy;breast cancer;COVID-19;public health administration;CANCER;REGRESSION;MORTALITY";Brazil;DATASUS;tabular;open;No;Brazil;yes
293;Objective: There is a lack of studies evaluating the COVID-19 pandemic effect on breast cancer detection according to age group. This study aimed to assess the pandemic impact on the trend of mammograms, breast biopsies, and breast cancer stage at diagnosis according to age group. Methods: This was an ecological time series study by inflection point regression model. We used data from women aged between 30 and 49, 50 and 69, and 70 years or more available in an open-access dataset of the Brazilian public healthcare system (2017-2021). We analyzed the trend of the variables in the pre-pandemic and the pandemic effect on the total time series. Results: The decreasing or stationary trend of mammograms in the pre-pandemic has changed to a decreasing trend in the total time series in all age groups. Before the pandemic, the increasing trend of breast biopsies has changed to stationary in the total time series in all age groups. The increasing trend of tumors at stages O to II in the pre-pandemic has changed to decreasing or stationary in the total time series. Finally, the increasing trend of tumors at stage III or IV remained increasing in the total time series in all age groups. Conclusion: The pandemic has changed the stationary or increasing trend to a decreasing or stationary trend of mammograms, breast biopsies, and tumors at stages 0 to II but has not influenced the increasing trend of tumors at stages III and IV in all age groups.;The New Coronavirus Pandemic and the Trend of Breast Cancer Diagnosis According to Age Group: Total and Interrupted Time Series Study;Hyeda, A., da Costa, E.S.M., Kowalski, S.C.;2023;MEDICAL PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE;0;10.1159/000530179;;"[Hyeda, Adriano; da Costa, Elide Sbardellotto Mariano; Kowalski, Sergio Candido] Fed Univ Parana UFPR, Postgrad Program Internal Med & Hlth Sci, Curitiba, PR, Brazil; [Hyeda, Adriano] Fed Univ Parana UFPR, Postgrad Program Internal Med & Hlth Sci, Gen Carneiro St, 181, Cent Bldg-11th Floor, BR-80060900 Curitiba, PR, Brazil";;"MORTALITY; IMPACT; DELAYS";"MORTALITY;IMPACT;DELAYS";Brazil;DATASUS;tabular;open;No;Brazil;yes
298;Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the expected mortality, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no global, frequently-updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 94 countries and territories, openly available as the regularly-updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that in several worst-affected countries (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) the excess mortality was above 50% of the expected annual mortality. At the same time, in several other countries (Australia, New Zealand) mortality during the pandemic was below the usual level, presumably due to social distancing measures decreasing the non-COVID infectious mortality. Furthermore, we found that while many countries have been reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, some countries have been substantially underreporting their COVID-19 deaths (e.g. Nicaragua, Russia, Uzbekistan), sometimes by two orders of magnitude (Tajikistan). Our results highlight the importance of open and rapid all-cause mortality reporting for pandemic monitoring. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

300;"Background: Helicobacter pylori infection can cause gastritis, gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, and gastric cancer. Its treatment involves different medications, but resistance to these treatments is increasing. It is currently considered a public health problem.Aims: to identify regimens used for H. pylori eradication by age group, year of treatment and geographical region of Colombia. Methods: A cross-sectional study that identified regimens used H. pylori eradication in outpatient consultations over a 6-year period based on a medication dispensing database of 8.5 million people affiliated to the Colombian Health System. The appropriate regimens were those that included a proton pump inhibitor, associated with two antibiotics recommended by clinical practice guidelines (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, moxiflox-acin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole, tinidazole, and furazolidone). Results: A total of 12,011 patients with a diagnosis of acid-peptic disease and H. pylori infection were identified, who had undergone 12,426 eradication treatment courses. Of these, 98.0% used a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and 91.1% used amoxicillin. A total of 56.1% of the regimens were considered adequate; of these, 42.0% were a combination of PPI, amoxicillin/ clarithromycin. This regimen predominated between 2015 and 2017 for all age groups.Conclusions: The management of H. pylori infection in the majority of patients is heterogeneous and inconsistent with current recommendations based on evidence of antimicrobial resistance.(c) 2022 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia.

304;Preterm birth (PTB) is a phenomenon that brings risks and challenges for the survival of the newborn child. Despite many advances in research, not all the causes of PTB are already clear. It is understood that PTB risk is multi-factorial and can also be associated with socioeconomic factors. Thereby, this article seeks to use unsupervised learning techniques to stratify PTB risk in Brazil using only socioeconomic data. Through the use of datasets made publicly available by the Federal Government of Brazil, a new dataset was generated with municipality-level socioeconomic data and a PTB occurrence rate. This dataset was processed using various unsupervised learning techniques, such as k-means, principal component analysis (PCA), and density-based spatial clustering of ap-plications with noise (DBSCAN). After validation, four clusters with high levels of PTB occurrence were discovered, as well as three with low levels. The clusters with high PTB were comprised mostly of municipalities with lower levels of education, worse quality of public services—such as basic sanitation and garbage collection—and a less white population. The regional distribution of the clusters was also observed, with clusters of high PTB located mostly in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil. The results indicate a positive influence of the quality of life and the offer of public services on the reduction in PTB risk. © 2022 by the authors.

319;Over the last two decades, video-assisted surgery has become the preferential access route for many procedures. Despite cholecystectomy being the laparoscopic procedure most frequently performed in Brazilian public hospitals from 2008 to 2012, the lack of population-based studies led us to conduct a survey on the prevalence of video-assisted surgery in the treatment of patients using the Sistema Aenico de SaA(0)de (SUS) (Unified Health System), which is the universal, free, and public healthcare system of Brazil. By analyzing the DATASUS (national public health registry database), the prevalence of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and open cholecystectomy (OC) was calculated in the period from January to December in 2008, 2010 and 2012, taking into consideration their geographic distribution throughout Brazil. At the end of the study period, an increase in the number of laparoscopic cholecystectomies was observed, with a variation of 125.7 %. However, OC was more prevalent despite an increase in the use of video-assisted surgery over the 5-year study period, increasing from 12 to 25 % in 2012. In spite of a trend toward increased use of video-assisted surgery for treating SUS patients during the period under study, the data from 2012 are still far from being ideal. For this population, OC via laparotomy is still the most prevalent option in all regions. This information must encourage the Brazilian surgical societies to push for an improvement in the supply of the treatment provided by the public health system.;Video-Assisted Surgery Implementation in the Public Health System of a Developing Country;Olijnyk, J.G., Cavazzola, L.T., de Aguilar-Nascimento, J.E., Nacul, M.P., Almeida, E.C.E.;2014;WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY;2;10.1007/s00268-014-2493-3;;"[Olijnyk, Jose Gustavo; Cavazzola, Leandro Totti; Nacul, Miguel Prestes] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Surg, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [de Aguilar-Nascimento, Jose Eduardo] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Dept Surg, Cuiaba, MT, Brazil; [Couto e Almeida Filho, Elias] Ctr Ensino & Treinamento Expt Ciencias Saude Cetr, Dept Expt Surg, Brasilia, DF, Brazil";;LAPAROSCOPIC CHOLECYSTECTOMY;LAPAROSCOPIC CHOLECYSTECTOMY;Brazil;DATASUS ;tabular;open;No;Brazil;yes
328;"Purpose: Prostate cancer (PC) is the second leading cause of cancer and the fifth cause of cancer-related death. This manuscript aims to determine the incidence, mortality, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) trends of PC in the last 30 years in Latin America and Mexico.

Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a publicly available data set. Data regarding the burden of prostate cancer in 20 Latin-American countries, and the 32 states of Mexico, were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Collected information included incidence and mortality rates (per 100,000), as well as the DALYs as absolute numbers and rates (per 100,000) and the annual rates of change in rates from 1990 to 2019.

Results: In Latin America in males aged 55 years or older, the mean incidence rate was 344 cases per 100,000. The number of deaths attributable to prostate cancer observed was 67,110 and the mean mortality rate was 210 per 100,000. The overall burden of disease was 1,120,709 DALYs and the contribution of years of life lost (YLL) was 91.7% ([Formula: see text] = 1,027,946). Mexico presented an incidence rate (279.6) and mortality (99.1) rate (per /100 thousand). In Mexico, 13 states had a DALYs' rate above the national mean (883 per 100,000) and the highest burden (1360 DALYs/100,000) were documented in the state of Guerrero (Southwestern Mexico).

336;"Objective: This study aims to evaluate the impact of the Pink October Campaign on the increase in mammographic screening in Brazil.

Study design: Ecological observational study, based on retrospective data.

Methods: Brazilian national screening database (DATASUS/SISMAMA/Information System on Breast Cancer) was used as a data source and is publicly available for download and analysis. We report screening numbers and outcome rates from January 2017 to December 2021 comparing statistically (ANOVA test, post-Tukey test), age groups, regions of Brazil, and the four quarters of the year.

Results: During the study period, the average number of exams performed monthly over the five years was 137,400.117. An increase in the number of mammograms performed in October was identified, as well as in the two following months, respectively 33%, 39%, and 22%, with statistical significance (p = 0.000) in relation to the three quarters of the year. In addition, in the other months, we found values below the monthly average. Statistical difference was not found in the increase in mammograms considering age groups (p = 0.5) and different regions of the country (p = 0.6).

Conclusions: This study showed an increase in mammographic screening in the three months following the Pink October Campaign, so we should intensify similar actions throughout the year and not just in October.

The causes of autism are still poorly understood, but research shows the relevance of genetic factors in its pathophysiology, including the CHD8, SCN2A, FOXP1 and SYNGAP1 genes. Information about the genetic influence on various diseases, including autism, in the Amerindian population from Amazon, is still scarce. We investigated 35 variants of the CHD8, SCN2A, FOXP1, and SYNGAP1 gene in Amazonian Amerindians in comparison with publicly available population frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project database. Our study identified 16 variants in the Amerindian population of the Amazon with frequencies significantly different from the other populations. Among them, the SCN2A (rs17183814, rs75109281, and rs150453735), FOXP1 (rs56850311 and rs939845), and SYNGAP1 (rs9394145 and rs115441992) variants presented higher frequency than all other populations analyzed. In addition, nine variants were found with lower frequency among the Amerindians: CHD8 (rs35057134 and rs10467770), SCN2A (rs3769951, rs2304014, rs1838846, and rs7593568), FOXP1 (rs112773801 and rs56850311), and SYNGAP1 (rs453590). These data show the unique genetic profile of the indigenous population of the Brazilian Amazon. Knowledge of these variants can help to understand the pathophysiology and diagnosis of autism among Amerindians, Brazilians, and in admixed populations that have contributions from this ethnic group.;Exome Evaluation of Autism-Associated Genes in Amazon American Populations;da Costa GE, Fernandes GL, Rodrigues JCG, da V B Leal DF, Pastana LF, Pereira EEB, Assumpção PP, Burbano RMR, Dos Santos SEB, Guerreiro JF, Fernandes MR, Dos Santos NPC.;2022;Genes (Basel);;10.3390/genes13020368;https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Exome_Evaluation_of_Autism-Associated_Genes_in_Amazon_American_Populations/18822272;Universidade federal do pará;;;;Brazil;Exome Evaluation of Autism-Associated Genes in Amazon American Populations;Genomic;Open;Yes;Brazil;yes
369;"Background and objectives: The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely impacted human society with a massive death toll worldwide. There is an urgent need for early and reliable screening of COVID-19 patients to provide better and timely patient care and to combat the spread of the disease. In this context, recent studies have reported some key advantages of using routine blood tests for initial screening of COVID-19 patients. In this article, first we present a review of the emerging techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis using routine laboratory and/or clinical data. Then, we propose ERLX which is an ensemble learning model for COVID-19 diagnosis from routine blood tests.

Method: The proposed model uses three well-known diverse classifiers, extra trees, random forest and logistic regression, which have different architectures and learning characteristics at the first level, and then combines their predictions by using a second level extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier to achieve a better performance. For data preparation, the proposed methodology employs a KNNImputer algorithm to handle null values in the dataset, isolation forest (iForest) to remove outlier data, and a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to balance data distribution. For model interpretability, features importance are reported by using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique.

Results: The proposed model was trained and evaluated by using a publicly available data set from Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil, which consisted of 5644 data samples with 559 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The ensemble model achieved outstanding performance with an overall accuracy of 99.88% [95% CI: 99.6-100], AUC of 99.38% [95% CI: 97.5-100], a sensitivity of 98.72% [95% CI: 94.6-100] and a specificity of 99.99% [95% CI: 99.99-100].

Discussion: The proposed model revealed better performance when compared against existing state-of-the-art studies (Banerjee et al., 2020; de Freitas Barbosa et al., 2020; de Moraes Batista et al., 2020; Soares et al., 2020) [3,22,56,71] for the same set of features employed by them. As compared to the best performing Bayes Net model (de Freitas Barbosa et al., 2020) [22] average accuracy of 95.159%, ERLX achieved an average accuracy of 99.94%. In comparison with AUC of 85% reported by the SVM model (de Moraes Batista et al., 2020) [56], ERLX obtained AUC of 99.77% in addition to improvements in sensitivity, and specificity. As compared with ER-COV model (Soares et al., 2020) [71] average sensitivity of 70.25% and specificity of 85.98%, ERLX model achieved sensitivity of 99.47% and specificity of 99.99%. The ERLX model obtained a considerably higher score as compared with ANN model (Banerjee et al., 2020) [3] in all performance metrics. Therefore, the model presented is robust and can be deployed for reliable early and rapid screening of COVID-19 patients.";Ensemble learning model for diagnosing COVID-19 from routine blood tests;AlJame M, Ahmad I, Imtiaz A, Mohammed A.;2020;Inform Med Unlocked;;10.1016/j.imu.2020.100449;https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/einsteindata4u/covid19;Kuwait University;;;;Brazil;COVID-19 Albert Einstein Hospital;Tabular;open;No;Kwait;no
374;"Objectives: High-throughput sequencing of genomes, exomes, and disease-focused gene panels is becoming increasingly common for molecular diagnostics. However, identifying a single clinically relevant pathogenic variant among thousands of genetic polymorphisms is a challenging task. Publicly available genomic databases are useful resources to filter out common genetic variants present in the population and enable the identification of each disease-causing variant. Based on our experience applying these technologies at Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (HCFMUSP), São Paulo, Brazil, we recognized that the Brazilian population is not adequately represented in widely available genomic databases.

Methods: Here, we took advantage of our 5-year experience as a high-throughput sequencing core facility focused on individuals with putative genetic disorders to build a genomic database that may serve as a more accurate reference for our patient population: SELAdb.

Results/conclusions: Currently, our database comprises a final cohort of 523 unrelated individuals, including patients or family members managed by different clinics of HCFMUSP. We compared SELAdb with other publicly available genomic databases and demonstrated that this population is very heterogeneous, largely resembling Latin American individuals of mixed origin, rather than individuals of pure European ancestry. Interestingly, exclusively through SELAdb, we identified a spectrum of known and potentially novel pathogenic variants in genes associated with highly penetrant Mendelian disorders, illustrating that pathogenic variants circulating in the Brazilian population that is treated in our clinics are underrepresented in other population databases.

406;"Objective: To determine the association between altitude and obesity in a nationally representative sample of the Peruvian adult population.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis of publicly available data from the Food and Nutrition National Center (CENAN, Peru), period 2009-2010. The Prevalence ratio of obesity and abdominal obesity was determined as a measure of association. Obesity and abdominal obesity were diagnosed based on direct anthropometric measurements.

Results: The final data set consisted of 31,549 individuals ≥20 years old. The prevalence ratio of obesity was as follows: 1.00 between 0 and 499 m (reference category), 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.87-1.16) between 500-1,499 m, 0.74 (0.63-0.86) between 1,500-2,999 m, and 0.54 (0.45-0.64) at ≥3,000 m, adjusting for age, sex, self-reported physical activity, out-migration rate, urbanization, poverty, education, and geographical latitude and longitude. In the same order, the adjusted prevalence ratio of abdominal obesity was 1.00, 1.01 (0.94-1.07), 0.93 (0.87-0.99), and 0.89 (0.82-0.95), respectively. We found an interaction between altitude and sex and between altitude and age (P < 0.001, for both interactions) on the association with obesity and abdominal obesity.

Conclusions: Among Peruvian adult individuals, we found an inverse association between altitude and obesity, adjusting for multiple covariates. This adjusted association varied by sex and age.";Inverse association between altitude and obesity: A prevalence study among andean and low-altitude adult individuals of Peru;Woolcott OO, Gutierrez C, Castillo OA, Elashoff RM, Stefanovski D, Bergman RN.;2016;Obesity (Silver Spring);;10.1002/oby.21401;https://www.datosabiertos.gob.pe/dataset/encuesta-nacional-de-hogares-enaho-2020-instituto-nacional-de-estad%C3%ADstica-e-inform%C3%A1tica-inei;"Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA; Instituto de Medicina Tropical Daniel A.

411;Monitoring the quality of medicines plays a crucial role in an integrated medicines quality assurance system. In a publicly available medicines quality database (MQDB), the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) reports results of data collected from medicines quality monitoring (MQM) activities spanning the period of 2003-2013 in 17 countries of Africa, Asia, and South America. The MQDB contains information on 15,063 samples collected and tested using Minilab® screening methods and/or pharmacopeial methods. Approximately 71% of the samples reported came from Asia, 23% from Africa, and 6% from South America. The samples collected and tested include mainly antibiotic, antimalarial, and antituberculosis medicines. A total of 848 samples, representing 5.6% of total samples, failed the quality test. The failure proportion per region was 11.5%, 10.4%, and 2.9% for South America, Africa, and Asia, respectively. Eighty-one counterfeit medicines were reported, 86.4% of which were found in Asia and 13.6% in Africa. Additional analysis of the data shows the distribution of poor-quality medicines per region and by therapeutic indication as well as possible trends of counterfeit medicines.;Monitoring the quality of medicines: results from Africa, Asia, and South America;Hajjou M, Krech L, Lane-Barlow C, Roth L, Pribluda VS, Phanouvong S, El-Hadri L, Evans L, Raymond C, Yuan E, Siv L, Vuong TA, Boateng KP, Okafor R, Chibwe KM, Lukulay PH.;2015;Am J Trop Med Hyg;;10.4269/ajtmh.14-0535;https://apps.usp.org/app/worldwide/medQualityDatabase/selectGeoLocation.html;Promoting the Quality of Medicines Program;;;;Guyana, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador;Medicines Quality Database (MQDB);Pharmacology data;open;Yes;N/A;N/A
